AB  - This paper adapts and extends the technological community perspective (e. g., Van de Ven, 1993), to review and analyze the outcomes of a series of three research projects funded by the Australian Government as reported in a number of publicly available documents. The projects were designed to support education for sustainability within Australian business schools and to promote knowledge sharing between the business schools and industry around sustainability. Project participants included seven business schools and their industry collaborators.
   The technological community perspective, which is particularly well-suited to examining this innovative education for sustainability project, is a theoretical framework that examines evolution of innovation at the community level; this includes multiple internal and external stakeholders, and is beyond the more traditional uni-dimensional focus on organization or industry levels. This approach provides lessons with respect to complex and dynamic interactions between and among multiple stakeholders responsible for successful development and dissemination of sustainability in business schools, corporations, and beyond.
   Hence, this paper addresses issues raised in the call for papers for the special issue of Journal of Management and Organization, 'Educating for Sustainability and CSR: What is the role of business schools?' The paper addresses the questions: (1) What are the barriers for business schools with respect to integrating sustainability in the curricula; (2) What role do partnerships with other stakeholders play in such initiatives?

AB  - Projects producing citizen-generating data (CGD) to provide evidence and to drive change have increased considerably in the last decade. Many of these initiatives build on multi-actor collaboration and are often supported by non-governmental organisations (NGOs), the public sector, businesses or community-based organisations. The joint efforts of these actors are often necessary to provide the resources and the support that citizens need to produce data. In return, organisations can harness the data to support their objectives. The recent growth (or up-scaling) of CGD projects has created opportunities, as well as challenges for capacity building and sustainability. These challenges can affect the continuity and effectiveness of these initiatives and, in turn, the quality and utility of collected data. This paper analyses two CGD projects to consider their social implications and the measures necessary to increase their capacity, up-scaling, spreading, and sustainability. The case studies on noise monitoring and invasive alien species describe, respectively, a bottom-up approach at city level and a top-down approach at the European level. Regardless of the approach, capacity building requires a process of infrastructuring that engages different actors, responds to matters of concern, assesses community capacities and needs, and develops a vision and action plan. Further, the appropriation and repurposing of technical systems is required to scale up and spread CGD projects. In this process, participants' activities are shaped by technologies, while the meaning and effects of technologies are shaped through participants' activities.

AB  - It is widely recognized that there is a need for engagement between stakeholders to establish locally accepted strategies for sustainable coastal management solutions around the world. Adaptive management approaches have emerged as one of the preferred mechanisms in coastal zone management. Central to the application of adaptive management is the effective engagement of stakeholders to encourage participatory decision-making. There are relatively few studies which have analysed the effectiveness and dynamics of stakeholder groups to establish sustainable adaptive management in practice, and identify what opportunities and challenges can arise from such collaborative approaches. This research critically evaluates stakeholder engagement in the adoption of adaptive management at East Head, England. The study has identified significant issues and opportunities that have arisen throughout the decision-making process. It has found that a major challenge has been to achieve acceptance of the mechanism of adaptive management, particularly in relation to aspects of uncertainty. However, it is of critical note that the advisory group in question has become a valuable vehicle in bringing together key stakeholders throughout all stages of the adoption of the adaptive management approach. It is suggested that this approach, has gradually reduced conflict through building knowledge, gaining trust and ultimately achieving acceptance. A widely applicable management model and recommendations for best practice are presented as derived from the views of the advisory group itself. This model has the potential to develop a more dynamic, holistic and sustainable approach to coastal governance both in the UK and at other locations further afield.

AB  - The complex nature of sustainability challenges implies the need to provide students with interdisciplinary learning experiences and environments based on active and reflective learning. To know whether these experiences result in real learning, there must be a way of capturing and measuring the competences required to promote sustainable development using suitable indicators. This paper presents the process of building a competence map that is used as a navigation chart to monitor the sustainable education competences in the Ocean i3 experience. An action-research methodological approach is used involving participant observation, field notes, informal interviews, and documentary analysis. The participants were 38 students, 23 teachers, 3 project coordinators, and 2 researchers, and the context of the study is the five workshops carried out in the Ocean i3 project. The result is a navigation chart that traces the students' learning journey through dialogue between the competences, learning outcomes, and activities. In conclusion, this approach to curricular planning can serve to inspire other learning environments and experiences on how to tackle the challenge of envisioning their sustainability competence development pathway. Above all, it can serve to improve competence development training schedules for sustainability.

AB  - Short food supply chains (SFSCs) are one of the most direct approaches to more directly connecting consumers with producers. The scaling-up of SFSCs is often challenged by critical issues which can be overcome with identification of the most sustainable, replicable schemes. This paper presents the results of a participatory analysis conducted within the agroBRIDGES H2020 project, with the aim of defining a list of economic, social, and environmental attributes and indicators to assess the sustainability of SFSCs and set up a decision-making tool to support producers in self-assessing their sustainability level and choosing the most appropriate business model (BM) from those identified within the project. The proposed framework was based on a literature review and validated using co-creation exercises (Delphi rounds and focus groups) with relevant European stakeholders. A final set of 47 indicators was identified, and their potential for use in assessing the sustainability level of various BMs was also validated. Early results highlighted three main issues: indicator calculation feasibility, business model categorization, and the simplicity of the framework for sustainability self-assessment. Some recommendations are made, including the importance of using a participatory process in building an evaluation framework on SFSC sustainability and the necessity of its adaptation to territorial contexts and needs.

AB  - Inter-organizational relationships are high on the health policy agenda. Scholars and practitioners have provided heterogeneous views about the triggers of collaborative practices and the success factors that underpin the sustainability of inter-organizational relationships in the health care domain. The article proposes a literature review aimed at systematizing current scientific research that contextualizes inter-organizational relationships to health care. A mixed approach was undertaken, which consisted of a bibliometric analysis followed by a narrative literature review. A tailored search strategy on Elsevier's Scopus yielded 411 relevant records, which were carefully screened for inclusion in this study. After screening, 105 papers were found to be consistent with the study purposes and included in this literature review. The findings emphasize that the establishment and implementation of inter-organizational relationships in health care are affected by several ambiguities, which concern both the governance and the structuring of collaborative relationships. The viability and the success of inter-organizational relationships depend on the ability of both central and peripheral partners to acknowledge and address such ambiguities. Failure to do so involves an opportunistic participation to inter-organizational relationships. This endangers conflicting behaviors rather than collaboration among partners.

AB  - Sustainable digital transformation is not just a technological shift but a comprehensive cultural and operational change for more efficient, effective, and sustainable processes. Existing studies neglect the importance of stakeholder collaboration in achieving these goals. This study addresses this gap by developing a Cooperative Governance Framework designed to align technological advancements with environmental and social objectives. Drawing on institutionalism and political systems theory, the study identifies five aspects and 36 criteria, using a hybrid approach of the Fuzzy Delphi Method and Fuzzy Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory. The study aims to identify and validate critical drivers of sustainable digital transformation in the construction industry, explore their interrelationships, and propose a comprehensive governance framework. The results validated 26 criteria and highlighted core drivers as digital enablement and digital strategy. Key practical findings emphasize the importance of digital infrastructure, competence, quality control, and business strategy integration for effective transformation.

AB  - Sustainability impact assessment tools aim at optimising the development of policy measures. Here, we present an approach to designing policies for multifunctional land use with application to Europe and its regions. After the 35 environmental, social and economic impact issues of the European Impact Assessment Guidelines were reviewed on the basis of spatiotemporal indicators at both the top-down Europe-wide and bottom-up intra-regional resolution level, cluster analysis identified classes with specific sustainability characteristics and thus regions most likely facing similar sustainability problems. Sensitive region types such as post-industrial zones, mountains, coasts and islands were analysed separately. The results of the cluster analysis were tested against evidence-based information such as UNEP priorities and regional stakeholder evidence. Stakeholder evidence was specifically explored for the land use policy 'bioenergy promotion' in Lusatia, Germany. We concluded that these top-down and bottom-up spatiotemporal data classifications with cluster analysis represent useful ex-ante impact assessment tools and need to be supplemented by participatory assessments. This procedure with top-down and bottom-up data analysis, and also participatory evidence, provide a valuable three-step sustainability impact assessment approach in policy making.

AB  - The causes and consequences of demographic changes for the environment, and the possible ways of influencing population dynamics to achieve 'sustainability', have been the subject of many debates in science and policy in recent decades. However, the body of knowledge concerning relationships between population dynamics and sustainability is quite fragmented, dispersed over many disciplines, and encompasses diverse theories, paradigms and methodologies. This paper reviews four selected frameworks: linear, multiplicative, mediated, and system-theoretical approaches and perspectives. We represent how population-environment relationships are conceptualized, provide examples of research questions and accepted approaches, and critically assess their utility for different sorts of research for sustainable development. We note the growing recognition of the value of embracing complexity in population-environment research, and how this is consistent with normative aims of development.

TI  - Reflecting on the use of community radio and performing arts for seeking accountability for those facing intersecting inequalities
T2  - COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT JOURNAL
LA  - English
AB  - "Community Radio - a different kind of radio, we work with our people. Together we plan, together we decide; together we implement. We work with our people" (GCRN Community Radio Anthem) . This practice-based article presents the experiences and reflections of two pioneer organizations which are continuously innovating with the use of community radio. We share reflections on its use as a tool for building inclusive communities that are able to seek accountability, especially for those facing intersecting inequalities deriving from identity-based as well as other social, economic and spatial drivers. These organizations are Radio Ada-based in the Greater Accra region in Ghana, founding member of the Ghana Community Radio Network (GCRN) and the Soroti Justice and Peace Commission (SOCAJAPIC) in North Eastern Uganda. Both organizations see community radio as central to their participatory practice, through which they articulate and promote the right to communicate as fundamental for inclusion and accountability . They partnered with the Institute of Development Studies (IDS) in the UK to explore how participatory action research processes can contribute to building sustainable social inclusion and pathways to accountability for the most marginalized (see Shaw, Howard and Lopez Franco (2020) Article in this issue). The article is primarily based on an interview with Wilna Quarmyne, Kofi Larweh, Ben Boham Okiror and John Elyanu, founding members and leaders of Radio Ada and SOCAJAPIC, respectively, but also draws on research data and from previous stages of work with both organizations as part of the Participate initiative's research on accountability for those most marginalized (Burns, Ikita, Lopez Franco, Shahrokh, (2015) Citizen Participation and Accountability for Sustainable Development, IDS, Brighton; Howard, Lopez Franco and Wheeler (2017) Participatory Monitoring and Accountability and the Sustainable Development Goals: A Learning Report of the Participate Network, Participate Network, Brighton. Find the full report at: https://opendocs.ids.ac.uk/opendocs/bitstream/handle/123456789/13326/Participate_LearningReport_Final.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y). Other reflective moments and dialogue, resulting through rounds of feedback to drafts of this article, have also shaped the outcome. The piece is organized in four sections in an aim to explain how community radio has been a key driver of accountability for populations confronting intersecting inequalities, through combining this with different expressions of participatory performing arts , simplified here as processes whereby "participants instigate and realise their own creative idea. They are the directors/curators of the piece. Professional artist/s are involved if it is the participants" decision to do so' (Tiller 2013 p11). The first section introduces the work of Radio Ada and SOCAJAPIC, explaining their approach to community radio, performing arts and social change, by each organization. Section 2 presents reflections on using radio as a means for shifting social norms in the quest for building inclusion. Section 3 speaks to the ways that community radio is being used to support multiple marginalized groups in seeking accountability. Section 4 presents some limitations and obstacles emerging for community radio stations to maintain their work towards sustained social change.

AB  - As with watershed management or adaptive management plans, place-based sustainability initiatives are required to deal with complex and intertwining systems of social and ecological organization. One approach to fostering successful place-based initiatives features the development and use of sustainability indicators to promote community dialog, thereby amplifying the risks and opportunities of movement toward more environmentally benign practices. This article uses the author's personal experience as a methodological springboard for demonstrating how the development of sustainability indicators at a landscape-scale were incorporated into community-based planning in the Lake Superior Basin. An introduction to the science and practice of indicator development is followed by two case studies involving different spatial and temporal scales of community engagement in the development of place-based sustainability initiatives. The relative success of these examples leads to a suite of principles for using public participation as a means for stressing the opportunities occasioned by the sustainability imperative.

AB  - Bio-based technologies such as biorefineries and aquaponics are considered key factors for the transition towards a sustainable bioeconomy, but they may fail due to a lack of public acceptance. The present study explores the level and determinants of citizens' general and local acceptance of two technologies (biorefineries and aquaponics) in two regions (a transition and a non-transition region). Furthermore, the relevance of key determinants, - more specifically social trust, affect, and perceived benefits and risks - in predicting acceptance are explored using partial-least-squares structural equation modeling. In total, 1989 participants from the transition region Rheinische Revier and other non-transition regions of the German state of North-Rhine Westphalia completed the online survey. The results show considerable consistency across the investigated contexts regarding the importance of the behavioral constructs in explaining citizens' technology acceptance, confirming the derived conceptual framework. Our findings also reveal a lower local acceptance of both biorefineries and aquaponics when compared to general acceptance rates, pointing to the so-called NIMBY (Not In My Back Yard) effect. Moreover, local acceptance was lower in the transition region, underlining the particular need for effective communication and participation strategies in those regions to successfully implement a sustainable bioeconomy.

AB  - Young people are the future of society and agents for social change. That is why it is so crucial to provide education that not only equips them with knowledge and skills but also changes their attitudes and behaviour towards sustainable development. The need for education that supports a more sustainable world has become more evident as it can enhance people's lives and contribute to sustainable development. STEM education is described as an interdisciplinary approach to learning in which students use science, technology, engineering, and mathematics in situations that establish links between school, community, work, and the global enterprise, thus allowing the growth of STEM. The hands-on, interactive, and visualization-based learning experience that 3D technologies provide helps students take a more active approach to the academic material that they are studying. Students have access to 3D models that not only allow them to go more deeply into each subject but also make it much easier for them to retain their ideas.

AB  - The conjugation of environment and technology coerced the industry to combine these two instruments towards a sustainable and resilient future. Industry 5.0 is the most recent infrastructural revolution of industrial sector technology based on technologies like human-machine interaction, artificial intelligence, IoT, Big Data, collaborative robots, etc. This happened when the sector radically turned its global focus to sustainability and set many environmental goals to meet the requirements. In this research, the authors identified the synergy between Industry 5.0 and green supply chain management (GSCM) for achieving this target at RMG industries in Bangladesh. GSCM is well known for environmental concerns in traditional supply chain stages. For developing countries, the solution of a sustainable approach to counter waste and pollution-related issues is not adequate enough. A proper understanding of the digitalized industrial approach through Industry 5.0 will enable them to make efficient decisions regarding sustainable goal accomplishment and proper monitoring of the initiatives. This paper illustrates how I5.0 can integrate with GSCM. In this synergy, this study has identified 9 synergistic factors and analyzed the impact of each factor by using the interpretive structural modeling approach. By using level portioning, the factors are illustrated in 7 different levels, and MICMAC analysis is used to categorize them. This study offers a detailed exploration of the synergy between Industry 5.0 and GSCM, offering a practical framework that can guide industry stakeholders in implementing advanced technologies to achieve sustainable development in the RMG sector.

AB  - Advancing transformations towards sustainability calls for change agents equipped with a new set of competencies. Such sustainability competencies have been articulated with multiplicity and ambiguity, which is counterproductive to joint and accelerated progress. A unified framework of sustainability learning objectives would provide guidance to students, educators, and administrators of sustainability programs. To this end, we carried out a systematic review of the relevant literature. After scanning thousands of publications, we identified over 270 peer-reviewed articles of highest relevance, spanning two decades. Despite appearance otherwise, we found that there is a high level of agreement among scholars over the sustainability competencies that students should be trained in. Expanding on the five key competencies, namely, systems-thinking, anticipatory, normative, strategic, and interpersonal competence, that have gained widespread use, this article synthesizes the new suggestions made over the past decade into a unified framework. It centers on 8 key competencies in sustainability (the 5 established and 3 emerging-intrapersonal, implementation, and integration competence), which are complemented by separate disciplinary, general, and other professional competencies. This comprehensive framework of key competencies in sustainability is applicable across disciplines and can guide faculty, students, and practitioners in their joint efforts to advance transformations towards sustainability.

AB  - The future belongs to the youth, but do they really have a say in it? Learning processes with regard to a successful socio-ecological change must start in childhood and adolescence in order to succeed in social transformation. The youth cannot be a passive part in a changing society-they have to be actively included in its design. When allowed to participate, young people can make important and effective contributions-which should not be reduced to sub-projects and opportunity structures. In a socio-political context, participation means involvement, collaboration, and commitment. In the context of intra- and inter-generational equity, as the core part of sustainable development, participation strategies should be developed that allow for a permanent and purposeful involvement of children and adolescents. Participation of young people is an important and appropriate step in strengthening those who are so strongly affected by the planning processes but are otherwise powerless. A successful involvement and participation of non-professional actors requires a target group-oriented method, a supportive culture of participation, as well as clarity and decision latitude. Abiding by these rules leads to central results.

AB  - The rapid application of digital technology in rural areas has been carried out worldwide, but academic research on the theme of digital villages is still in its infancy. The academia is still unclear about the construction content, theoretical framework and realization path of the digital village construction. Against this background, this paper studies how villages can transform into digital villages and achieve a sustainable development. Firstly, this paper builds a digital village technology architecture system from four levels: infrastructure system, village brain, application support system and application service system. The system points out the specific construction content from the technical point of view, and provides scientific guidance for construction activities. Secondly, with the help of digital empowerment theory, the theoretical framework of the digital village construction to promote a sustainable rural development, is constructed from five fields: industry, ecology, culture, service and governance. Finally, the theoretical framework is verified through five Chinese cases, and two characteristics of a digital village construction are summarized to provide reference and guidance for digital village practice activities. The digital village construction should use data, digital technology and digital platform as the base, attract multiple subjects to participate and form symbiotic relationships, and achieve a rural sustainable development.

AB  - Understanding how science, technology and innovation can best help to accelerate progress in achieving sustainable development remains a grand challenge for researchers and practitioners. In the context of the global consultation process for preparing a post-2015 Sustainable Development Agenda, various science-based actor networks have emerged, aiming to translate research into political decision-making and to inform transformations towards sustainability. Over the last years, these networks seem to have taken an ever-growing role in structuring the science-policy interface in global sustainability governance. The question arises, however, how they understand and organize 'scientific knowledge integration' in sustainability politics. This study offers a structured comparison of twelve global science-based actor networks engaged in the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals. It shows that these networks use two types of strategies to foster scientific knowledge integration in sustainability governance. A new framework emerges, in which each strategy corresponds to two main approaches of scientific knowledge integration: The entrepreneurial strategy generally seeks to advance advice-oriented and solution-oriented knowledge processes, while assessmentoriented and learning-oriented processes in scientific knowledge integration are mainly promoted through a mediating strategy.

AB  - Unsustainable food production and consumption contribute to greenhouse gas emissions and global warming. Adopting a more plant-based diet has been identified as a necessary change toward a more sustainable food system. In response to the call for transdisciplinary research on the sustainability of food consumption, this exploratory study combined consumer science, nutrition and health, sustainability research, and innovation to develop a new approach that can accelerate the shift toward a more sustainable diet. Quantitative data on the eating habits and attitudes of 1785 consumers was combined with data on environmental impacts via a life cycle assessment for different consumer segments. We studied the sustainable dietary shift using the diffusion of innovation theory, as well as qualitative and quantitative approaches. We identified and characterized seven consumer segments and related habits and attitudes toward an increase in plant-based foods and meat reduction. The nutritional quality and the environmental footprint of the segments' dinners showed large differences. The results indicate that moving consumers along the innovation adoption curve with targeted interventions can reduce the environmental footprint of people's diets and improve dietary health. We also discussed the value of user-centric innovation tools for the translation of insights into interventions by working with personas.

AB  - The process of consulting stakeholders, particularly farmers, in developing appropriate indicators for sustainability evaluation of low-input ruminant systems is often compromised by limited awareness and understanding of the sustainability concept by farmers in developing countries. Insights from farmers' challenges present useful prospects for developing context-specific sustainability evaluation indicators for low-input ruminant systems. In the present review, a meta-analysis was used to develop farmer challenge-derived indicators for the sustainability evaluation of low-input ruminant farming system in sub-Saharan Africa. Key ecological challenges reported were low forage quality, poor soil quality, feed shortages and; economic challenges were low poor marketing structure, high cost of labour, and poor transport network, poor marketing infrastructure; and social challenges were rural to urban migration, lack of animal breeding management and inadequate access to information. The corresponding derived ecological indicators were biomass quality, soil quality, high winds; economic indicators were available marketing infrastructure, labour costs, transport networks; and social indicators were rural to urban migration, animal management training and access to information. The review shows that farmers' challenges can be transformed to indicators for assessing the sustainability of the low-input ruminant farming system in sub-Saharan Africa.

TI  - Design-driven regional industry transformation and upgrading under the perspective of sustainable development
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
LA  - English
AB  - This study combines relevant theories and methods from economics and ecology to investigate design-driven transformation and upgrade paths for the long-term success of regional industries in the context of sustainable transformation, drawing on the design research literature's emphasis on sustainability, synergy, and a systemic approach. This evaluation may be thought of as a precondition for transformation. The regional industrial base dictates the upgrading route for sustainable transformation. Huaihua, a prefecture-level city in Hunan Province, China, serves as a case study for this investigation. Huaihua City's ecological footprints, human development index, and ecological welfare performance are used to evaluate the region's industrial base. A system based on quantitative data criteria and hierarchical analysis was built to choose top regional industries. The design study has promising implications for the sustainable transformation of major regional industries since it is an interdisciplinary, collaborative, and methodical type of research. Huaihua City, as a representative region of the less developed southwest region in China, designs a sustainable industrial transformation and upgrading path by providing a theoretical basis and quantitative measurement criteria for the sustainable transformation of regional industries.

AB  - This study examines the relationship between Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) disclosures and perceived financial performance within the context of Islamic finance, with a focus on Maqasid al-Shariah-the overarching goals of Islamic law. Using a quantitative approach, the study surveyed 350 stakeholders in Saudi Arabia's Islamic finance sector, including corporate managers, investment professionals, and financial analysts, over a six-month period (May to October 2024). The findings indicate that stakeholders perceive a positive relationship between ESG disclosures and financial performance, particularly when companies align their ESG practices with Islamic finance principles. However, the study does not measure actual financial performance; rather, it assesses stakeholders' perceptions of ESG's influence on corporate governance, risk management, and investment attractiveness. Results suggest that companies integrating ESG principles with Maqasid al-Shariah foster greater stakeholder trust, enhance corporate responsibility, and promote long-term sustainability. However, variations in trust and investment decisions exist based on industry type, ESG disclosure levels, and demographic factors such as experience and familiarity with ESG practices. The study provides novel insights into how Islamic finance principles shape ESG disclosure practices, offering practical recommendations for improving corporate governance and sustainability. By emphasizing transparency, ethical investment, and regulatory alignment, these findings contribute to ongoing discussions on sustainable finance and the role of ESG in shaping Islamic financial institutions.

AB  - In the current context of climate change and ecological awareness, designing sustainable environments is definitely understood as a shared responsibility. With the construction sector consuming half of the world's energy, the role of some key stakeholders such as architects becomes even more critical when providing responsible and relevant design for the built environment. Thus, improving the way our environments are being designed challenges some cultural systems that show evident limits, such as the training of future architects and engineers.
   In this research, the focus is on architecture students and aims to demonstrate how the use of a new sustainable performance simulation tool, called Easy Approach for Sustainable and Environmental Design (EASED) could contribute to educate them about innovatively sustainable design. This was assessed through the evaluation of student engagement, their use of the tool and its appropriation. Results show that individual work was not convincing, whereas success was met during group work. Limits and improvement possibilities were found in the interface of EASED as well as in the educational set up of the tool. (C) 2019 Higher Education Press Limited Company.

AB  - PurposeThis study aims to explore how engineering curricula can address sustainability considerations. Through a cross-case analysis, a hybrid theoretical-empirical model is developed to identify and analyse a broad range of possible and actual responses to sustainability within engineering education.Design/methodology/approachThe study employs a multiple-case study design to compare the experiences of educators and students engaging with sustainability topics in two contrasting tertiary civil engineering programs. It draws on an original conceptual framework informed by the literature for analysing educational responses to sustainability around the world, which can be applied to a diverse range of educational settings. Conceptual review, fieldwork, case-specific and cross-case analysis have been used to refine the framework, enabling the emergence of a hybrid model.FindingsThe hybrid model suggests three levels of response to sustainability in engineering education, which can be characterised as: 1) incorporation, 2) integration and 3) transformation. Each level is analysed in relation to five dimensions: functions, content, relationships, spaces and time, which influence the nature of the response and its capacity to foster learning. Cross-case analysis findings suggest that the shape and focus of a particular response to sustainability are significantly influenced by both the types of engineering problems, and the diversity and extent of relationships that engineering educators and students engage during teaching and learning.Practical implicationsCross-case analysis reveals that developing and supporting (inter)subjective relationships can play a pivotal role in fostering a transformation level of response. Engagement with Indigenous, more-than-human and interdisciplinary perspectives in engineering education for sustainability can also be critical to deepening students' reflexivity.Originality/valueThe study helps ground theory-driven frameworks for analysing the nature and purpose of responses to sustainability in engineering education, and higher education more broadly. The study also offers a novel hybrid model for identifying and classifying responses to sustainability in engineering education and other disciplines.

AB  - Education for sustainable development (ESD) is transformative education aiming at developing participants' understanding of sustainability issues and transforming their attitudes and behaviours regarding environment, society and economy. Sustainability consciousness, an expected outcome of ESD, is a complex of cognitive and affective learning. Development of sustainability consciousness requires transformative learning experiences. The study presented in this paper employed action research to enhance sustainability consciousness of the preservice teachers through inquiry based learning. The study was done in the Institute of "Education, Lahore College for Women University, Pakistan. The study integrated sustainability education in an existing course entitled 'Research Methods in Education'. The course is included in the final year of B.Ed. (Honours) programme. Outcome of the ESD-integration was measured in terms of change in the sustainability consciousness of the preservice teachers. The Action Research project engaged 27 preservice teachers in inquiry-based learning (empirical investigations and research based discussions) for a period of 11 weeks. The participants investigated sustainability issues collaboratively. To investigate the change in participants' sustainability consciousness through inquiry based learning, researchers collected through pre- and post-tests, interviews and observation. Quantitative data were analyzed through paired t-test while qualitative data through thematic coding. The data indicate that empirical investigations into sustainability issues by the presevice teachers and research based discussions enhanced preservice teachers' sustainability consciousness. This highlights the transformative potential of inquiry based learning. Moreover, it indicates that sustainability education can be successfully integrated in the course of 'research methods in education'. The findings suggest that teacher education programmes and other university programmes may employ inquiry based learning as a vehicle to enhance sustainability consciousness of the undergraduate students.

AB  - Social development is essential for improving quality of life, fostering stability, driving economic growth, achieving sustainable goals, enhancing human capital, encouraging civic engagement, building resilience, and fostering innovation, thereby ensuring inclusive, equitable, and sustainable progress. The Social Progress Index (SPI), also known as social development, contains all these features. This study aims to examine the impact of natural resource extraction on social development quadratically using data from 2011 to 2022. The focus of the study is on resource-rich countries. In this study, productive capacity in the energy sector is used as a social development determinant and a natural resource consumption moderator, ensuring sustainability in social development. Analyzing the quadratic relationship allows us to model and understand nonlinear relationships between the predictor and the outcome variable, capturing the effects that change direction or strength at different levels of the predictor. In this study, Bayesian regression is incorporated as an econometric approach. It provides more flexible modelling, incorporates prior knowledge, and offers a full distribution of parameter estimates, leading to better uncertainty quantification and more robust predictions. These estimates confirms a Ushaped natural resource extraction and social development relationship. Energy productive capacities in resource-rich countries not only enhance social development but also ensure the sustainable extraction of natural resources leading to sustainable social development. Population density and biodiversity are incorporated as control variables of the model. The impact of both is positive on social development.

AB  - Academic research on sustainability issues in supply chain collaboration has recently begun to focus more on a network-oriented view. Both horizontal and vertical relationships are being explored, which has led to recognition of the significance of the active participation of change agents in this process. This paper provides a practical example of how change agents shifted an entire chain (pig farming) towards sustainability over 17 years. The longitudinal study examined the mechanics of how change agents in a chain successfully engage others on sustainability issues. A sensemaking approach was used that focussed on three aspects: communication, action, and building relationships. The findings show that the change agents worked on different levels of supply chain collaboration in response to the evolution of the sustainability initiative. Their focus moved from producers controlling the entire chain to engaging in partnerships with other contributors both inside and outside the chain. They translated the abstract concept of sustainability into language understandable for the potential partners, fostering transparency, joined an eco-label certification program, and later invested in experiments to find solutions to new ideas as they arose through reflection. This stepwise construction of a netchain reveals the evolution of reciprocal interdependence in an informal, personal and trust-based way between organizations which can be applied to sustainability initiatives in other fields.

AB  - With the rapid urbanization, many cities are facing various environmental issues, resulting in local ecological degradation. It is critical to conduct a scientific assessment so that appropriate solutions can be found by considering the local realities. Many evaluation methods, such as emergy analysis, material flow analysis, data envelopment analysis and ecological footprint analysis, have been proposed. Among them, ecological footprint analysis has been applied as a useful policy and planning tool for evaluating urban sustainability. The aim of this paper is to evaluate two industrial cities by using ecological footprint method in Shenyang, China and Kawasaki, Japan. The two cities have been "friendship cities" for over 30 years and have similar industrial structures. In order to present a holistic evolution picture on their ecological footprints, we collected all the relevant data for the period of 1997-2009. The results show that Shenyang's ecological footprints experienced a significant increase, while such figures in Kawasaki were quite stable, but per capita figures in Shenyang were much less than those in Kawasaki, indicating that a gap between the two cities still exist. In order to further improve its sustainable development, Shenyang should closely collaborate with Kawasaki, learning Kawasaki's eco-town experiences and other environmental management experiences. In addition, Shenyang should also learn from other leading cities and try to optimize its industrial and energy structure and improve their citizens' environmental awareness so that it can move toward a more sustainable development direction.

AB  - This paper presents a map describing the main geomorphological and sedimentological features, hydrodynamics, benthic habitat distributions and human impact on the coastal and marine areas of the Archipelago of La Maddalena (NE Sardinia, western Mediterranean). This cartography is based on an interdisciplinary sea-land approach, with the aim being to support sustainable and successful beach management in the face of a changing climate and environment, thereby contributing to the achievement of the Agenda 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (13, 14 and 15). In the Main Map (1:14,000 scale), the static and dynamic features of the beach systems and adjacent inner shelf are divided into thematic sections that include the geomorphological elements, hydrodynamics, sedimentological distributions, benthic habitat (mainly Posidonia oceanica meadow) and anthropogenic impacts. The map establishes a fundamental, multidisciplinary benchmark that is able to provide substantial scientific support to policymakers in relation to future vulnerability-assessment activities and the definition of land-management strategies.

AB  - There are both practical and ethical goals for partnering with communities in the co-production of knowledge for sustainable livelihoods. The benefits of partnering with communities include trust creation, enhanced impact, and improved sustainability of development outcomes. However, for Indigenous groups and ethnic minorities, the barriers and burdens of participation in donor-driven initiatives can be immense. We share our experiences in developing and applying an Ethical Community Engagement (ECE) framework to facilitate the inclusion of poor, marginalised women in two villages in the Bankura district of West Bengal, India. People in Hakimsinan and Chakadoba villages identify as Santhals, the largest Indigenous group in West Bengal, and are recognised as a Scheduled Tribe in the Indian constitution. The framework informed both the design of research activities and the team's interactions with tribal communities. Trialling the framework in an agriculture intensification project that aimed to increase food availability and diversity, and by extension improve nutrition outcomes, created many opportunities to explore more sustainable and culturally appropriate production options. For participating villages, improved agriculture-nutrition links were made but only after local institutions were strengthened. For the broader partnership, the ECE approach presented multiple avenues for cross-learning. We share some of the broader challenges that presented in the course of working this way, providing reflections on the shifts we observed were necessary for the framework to be applied successfully. We conclude with a discussion on navigating the tensions and barriers that transdisciplinary science presents more broadly.

AB  - The Longmen Shan fault area in southwest China is one of the world's most active earthquake zones. The epicenters of the two most recent earthquakes, the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake (8.0Ms) and the 2013 Lushan earthquake (7.0Ms), both of which caused serious losses, were only 85km apart. Community-based disaster risk reduction is the foundation of the disaster management system pyramid and is critical to the success of sustainable hazard mitigation'. Based on multiple collaborative stakeholder perspectives, this paper examines public participation in an NGO-oriented Community for Disaster Prevention and Mitigation (N-CDPM) in the period between the two earthquakes as a multi-stage problem; N-CDPM establishment, normal operations, disaster testing, and continuous improvement. Multi-stage field research was conducted in the affected areas in the Longmen Shan fault area to examine the collaboration in each stage, after which the differences were compared across the four stages based on eight key indices; scales, core stakeholders, core network stability, mean number of lines, mean collaborative level, governments, and individual and public organization participation. The government participation, individual participation, and public organization participation are then discussed. This paper provides a novel research approach to CDPM in multiple earthquake regions and gives rich insights into the collaboration between the government and the public for N-CDPM.

AB  - Sustainability has become a significant concern worldwide in recent decades. There seems to be implicit competition among firms for better sustainability performance. Like any other firm activity, sustainability undertakings require resources and their efficient use to achieve the desired performance. Firms may hesitate to undertake sustainability initiatives due to the underlying costs, leading to the question of how efficient they are in their sustainability practices. Relying on data from CSRHub and COMPUSTAT, we employed data envelopment analysis to evaluate the sustainability efficiency of 1141 large U.S. manufacturing firms from 2009 to 2018. We measured the sustainability efficiency of each firm relative to those on the efficient frontier for all the firms in our sample and also separately for each industry. The analysis results indicate that firms' sustainability efficiency varies across years and industries. Furthermore, we show a quadratic relationship between sustainability performance and sustainability efficiency. This finding implies a process that begins with firms struggling to streamline their sustainability efforts and decreasing their efficiency as sustainability performance increases. Sustainability efficiency starts increasing only after a certain threshold is reached in sustainability performance. Our findings offer valuable insights for firms and stakeholders in their efforts to achieve desired levels of sustainability efficiency.

AB  - Regulation of nitrogen (N) loss from the agri-environment is a global challenge with dire consequences for food production and environmental management. This is also the case in Denmark where regulation largely relies on general measures for reducing N inputs. These measures have significantly reduced nitrogen emissions, but further reduction is needed to achieve sustainable low levels of N transport to freshwater and marine ecosystems in compliance with standards set by the EU Water Framework Directive. As an alternative to general regulation, we tested a watershed-based, collaborative planning approach, engaging stakeholders in solution identification. Six watersheds with substantial agricultural production were used as test areas. A collaborative planning process of two stakeholder workshops embedded within a scenario formulation process was executed. Stakeholder inputs about possible, desirable and sustainable futures were used to formulate scenarios, for which N reduction effects were calculated. Upon conclusion of this process, results were assessed using a structured evaluation method. Results indicate that the process we tested was successful in terms of (1) engaging relevant stakeholders, (2) providing relevant data, (3) achieving processual flexibility, (4) including local knowledge and (5) facilitating a creative and explorative process. On this basis, suggestions for improving collaborative planning processes are provided.

AB  - For stimulating sustainable development in developing countries, land use patterns and land use changes are considered critical, and therefore effective and efficient land use policies are needed. In this paper we present a methodological framework that has been developed in a joint European and developing countries project (LUPIS - Land Use Policies and Sustainable Development in Developing Countries), to assess the impact of land use policies on sustainable development in developing countries. An illustrative application is presented for a case study in China, where water pollution due to agriculture in Taihu Basin is a major problem.
   We argue that an integrated assessment is required, considering multiple drivers and indicators that determine the objectives and constraints of the stakeholders involved. Therefore, the sustainability impact assessment (SIA) is based on the concept of Land Use Functions (LUFs), and impacts on these LUFs are discussed with stakeholders based on a multi-criteria analysis. LUFs comprise economic, environmental and social indicators relevant for stakeholders at multiple scales. Instead of focusing only on the indicators that determine the problem (e.g., nutrient leaching in the Chinese case study), we take a broader perspective (considering also social, economic and institutional objectives and constraints), such that feasible policy options can be recommended. Stakeholders have a large role in discussing the selection of indicators and policies (pre-modelling), evaluating the impacts on indicators (modelling), and the weighing of indicators and LUFs (post-modelling). For the assessment of impacts on indicators (modelling), quantitative and qualitative approaches are combined. We present and discuss an impact assessment of policy options in Taihu Basin, for the current situation and towards 2015. The methodological framework as presented here proved to be useful to guide a sustainability impact assessment in China and six other case study regions. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Investment decision-making based on aspects of sustainability is gaining importance among organizations around the globe. In this context, there is a need for quality investment decisions, which require sufficient knowledge among organizational managers about managing sustainability information to achieve environmental objectives that meet stakeholder expectations. This has led to the emergence of organizational performance measuring tools such as the Sustainability Balanced Scorecard, which integrates the environmental perspective into the traditional Balanced Scorecard. Using experimental research method, the objective of this study is to investigate the indirect effect of Eco-efficiency knowledge and Sustainability Balanced Scorecard knowledge as mediators influencing the relationship between Sustainability Balanced Scorecard types and their impact on environmental investment decision-making. Findings of the current research are based on 60 respondents who were randomly assigned to one of the following two types of Sustainability Balanced Scorecard architecture: (1) environmental data embedded within the traditional Balanced Scorecard perspectives; and (2) standalone environmental data as an additional fifth perspective along with the traditional Balanced Scorecard architecture. The traditional Balanced Scorecard without any information on environmental perspective is included in the experiment as the control condition. The findings indicate that the combined effect of eco-efficiency knowledge and Sustainability Balanced Scorecard knowledge has a significant positive influence on the relationship between the Balanced Scorecard type versus Sustainability Balanced Scorecard type and environmental investment decision-making.

AB  - Engaging the public in low-carbon community development is an important step toward achieving the UN Sustainability Goals. Research on residents' participation in low-carbon activities has primarily focused on socio-demographic, economic, and institutional contextual factors. How residents' subjective perceptions of place influence their participation in developing low-carbon communities has scarcely been studied. This study ex-amines the relationship between place attachment and public attitudes and behaviors towards low-carbon community development in Beijing, China. A three-dimensional model of place attachment including per-sonal, social, and environmental contexts was proposed. Exploratory factor analysis, confirmative factor analysis and structural equation modeling were conducted via a survey of 300 participants. Results confirm the validity of the three-dimensional model of place attachment and indicate (a) a significant and positive effect of place attachment on participation attitude; (b) a significant and positive effect of place attachment on participation behavior; (c) a significant and positive effect of participation attitude on behavior; and (d) environmental contexts more strongly affect participation attitude and behavior than personal and social contexts. The findings assist relevant authorities in engaging locals in low-carbon participation by investing in neighborhood revital-isation, promoting social outreach activities and sharing low-carbon knowledge. Practitioners should consider both symbolic and environmental elements for residents when planning and renewing communities.

AB  - Background Immediate postpartum long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) is an evidence-based practice, but hospitals face significant barriers to its adoption. Our objective was to examine how organizational context (e.g., size, employee attitudes toward the clinical practice) and implementation strategies (i.e., the actions taken to routinize a clinical practice) drive successful implementation of immediate postpartum LARC services, with a goal of informing the design of future implementation interventions.Methods We conducted a comparative case study of the implementation of inpatient postpartum contraceptive care at 11 US maternity hospitals. In 2017-2018, we conducted site visits that included semi-structured key informant interviews informed by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research. Qualitative measures of implementation success included stakeholder satisfaction, routinization, and sustainability of immediate postpartum LARC services. Qualitative content analysis and cross-case synthesis explored relationships among organizational context, implementation strategies, and implementation success.Results We completed semi-structured interviews with 78 clinicians, nurses, residents, pharmacy and revenue cycle staff, and hospital administrators. Successful implementation required three essential conditions: effective implementation champions, an enabling financial environment, and hospital administrator engagement. Six other contextual conditions were influential: trust and effective communication, alignment with stakeholders' professional values, perception of meeting patients' needs, robust learning climate, compatibility with workflow, and positive attitudes and adequate knowledge about the clinical practice. On average, sites used 18 (range 11-22) strategies. Strategies to optimize the financial environment and train clinicians and staff were commonly used. Strategies to plan and evaluate implementation and to engage patients emerged as promising to address barriers to practice change, yet were often underused.Conclusions Implementation efforts in maternity settings may be more successful if they select strategies to optimize local conditions for success. Our findings elucidate key contextual conditions to target and provide a menu of promising implementation strategies for incorporating recommended contraceptive services into routine maternity practice. Additional prospective research should evaluate whether these strategies effectively optimize local conditions for successful implementation in a variety of settings.

AB  - In this age of digital transformation, knowledge-intensive organizations strive to improve business outcomes and sustainability by improving their knowledge-intensive business processes (KIBPs) to obtain a competitive advantage. Many researchers have claimed that KIBP enhancement is possible through knowledge management (KM) initiatives supported by an effective KM infrastructure. Current KM infrastructures deal with formal KM procedures, where knowledge is created, stored, assimilated, and disseminated. Such activities, however, are designed to be performed outside of the business process. KM infrastructures are expected to be more effective when they include specific real-time knowledge procedures integrated into the operational flow of KIBPs. This paper explores how modern KM infrastructures can support KIBPs, considering both formal and operational KM procedures. Our study's essential contribution is the conceptual KM infrastructure framework (KMIF) developed based on grounded theory research. This infrastructure provides a systematic and robust approach, starting from the ground up, for structuring organizational knowledge assets across a range of KIBP environments. We define operational knowledge procedures directly involved in KIBPs, adding a layer to KM infrastructures beyond the formal knowledge procedures. A mixed-method case study was conducted to demonstrate and evaluate the proposed KMIF for enhancing business outcomes and sustainability of knowledge-intensive organizations.

AB  - This paper explores the global landscape of civil resistance to mineral extraction and its implications for the political sustainability of the energy transition. As global demand for critical minerals accelerates in association with the energy transition, there is a growing imperative to secure mineral access while improving environmental and social outcomes. However, mining activities face significant resistance worldwide, posing major challenges to the justice and viability of the energy transition. Using an original dataset derived from the GDELT Project between 2015 and 2022, we provide the first systematic global mapping of conflict and cooperation in mining regions, spanning diverse socio-political contexts and offering novel insights into the economic, environmental, and justice-related drivers of these dynamics. Our findings reveal that resistance to mineral extraction is not confined to poorer, emerging economies but is instead widespread, occurring wherever mineral deposits are found, regardless of a country's income level. This resistance frequently reaches high levels of polarisation, often leading to costly delays and project cancellations. Although cooperation sometimes accompanies conflict, high-commitment cooperative actions are limited and less frequent in highly polarised situations. These insights highlight the need to move beyond traditional Corporate Social Responsibility approaches and existing public participation efforts within Environmental Impact Assessments. A just, sustainable, and democratic transition requires a deeper democratisation of investment decisions through inclusive governance frameworks that tackle the several injustices associated with mineral resource extraction.

AB  - In developing nations, catastrophic health expenditures have become an all-too-common occurrence, threatening to push households into impoverishment and poverty. By analyzing the Household Income and Expenditure Survey 2016, which features a sample of 46,080 households, this study provides a comprehensive district-by-district analysis of the variation in household catastrophic health expenditures and related factors. The study utilizes a multilevel logistic regression model, which considers both fixed and random effects to identify factors associated with catastrophic health expenditure. The findings of the study indicate that districts located in the eastern and southern regions are at a significantly higher risk of experiencing catastrophic health expenditures. A potential explanation for this trend may be attributed to the high prevalence of chronic diseases in these districts, as well as their economic conditions. The presence of chronic diseases (AOR 5.45 with 95% CI: 5.14, 5.77), presence of old age person (AOR 1.50 with 95% CI: 1.39, 1.61), place of residence (AOR 1.40 with 95% CI: 1.14, 1.73) are found to be highly associated factors. Additionally, the study reveals that the thresholds used to define catastrophic health expenditures exhibit substantial variation across different regions, and differ remarkably from the threshold established by the WHO. On average, the thresholds are 23.12% of nonfood expenditure and 12.14% of total expenditure. In light of these findings, this study offers important insights for policymakers and stakeholders working towards achieving universal health coverage and sustainable development goals in Bangladesh.

TI  - Indicators of sustainable capacity building for health research: analysis of four African case studies
T2  - HEALTH RESEARCH POLICY AND SYSTEMS

KW  - POLICY
AB  - Background: Despite substantial investment in health capacity building in developing countries, evaluations of capacity building effectiveness are scarce. By analysing projects in Africa that had successfully built sustainable capacity, we aimed to identify evidence that could indicate that capacity building was likely to be sustainable.
   Methods: Four projects were selected as case studies using pre-determined criteria, including the achievement of sustainable capacity. By mapping the capacity building activities in each case study onto a framework previously used for evaluating health research capacity in Ghana, we were able to identify activities that were common to all projects. We used these activities to derive indicators which could be used in other projects to monitor progress towards building sustainable research capacity.
   Results: Indicators of sustainable capacity building increased in complexity as projects matured and included
   - early engagement of stakeholders; explicit plans for scale up; strategies for influencing policies; quality assessments (awareness and experiential stages)
   - improved resources; institutionalisation of activities; innovation (expansion stage)
   - funding for core activities secured; management and decision-making led by southern partners (consolidation stage).
   Projects became sustainable after a median of 66 months. The main challenges to achieving sustainability were high turnover of staff and stakeholders, and difficulties in embedding new activities into existing systems, securing funding and influencing policy development.
   Conclusions: Our indicators of sustainable capacity building need to be tested prospectively in a variety of projects to assess their usefulness. For each project the evidence required to show that indicators have been achieved should evolve with the project and they should be determined prospectively in collaboration with stakeholders.

AB  - Latest findings of the IPCC highlight the fact that there is an urgent need for climate action on both individual and societal levels, because political regulations and technical advances just would not be enough to counter climate change. Acknowledging young people's role as present and future decision-makers, their engagement is absolutely imperative in order to achieve Sustainable Development Goal 13, "Climate Action." Therefore, new methods of teaching and learning are necessary, and they need to encourage transformative learning, which, it is assumed, will lay foundations for transformative engagement. Research in the field of science education credits scientific literacy vision III as fostering transformative learning and engagement. In this study, transdisciplinary education is analyzed as a promising concept that enables exchange of knowledge, experiences, and perspectives between students and scientific partners while they jointly complete research on real-world issues. A quantitative analysis capturing scientific literacy and transformative engagement for climate action of Austrian and German secondary school students (N = 162) is carried out alongside a literature review. This study reveals that the didactical concept of transdisciplinary education notably contributes to the implementation of scientific literacy vision III as well as vision II. According to the results, the three visions of scientific literacy are predictors for transformative engagement for climate action, assuming to be preceded by a transformative learning process. These encouraging findings need to be replicated by further scholars in other contexts.

AB  - Digital technologies are transforming how we monitor and manage natural resources, by speeding up data-driven decision-making. Still, to date, there is scant evidence of their impacts on environmental sustainability. In fisheries, a digital record of landings represents enormous potential for sustainable food production, resource management, and livelihoods, by making information about fish production and price available to all. To fill a gap in information and understanding about fisheries in Timor-Leste at the time, and to inform decision-making to renew outdated fisheries legislations and strategies, the 'Peskas' system was developed and piloted in TimorLeste in 2017. Peskas was designed to collect, analyse and display small-scale fisheries data in near real-time to improve fisheries management through real-time data-driven policymaking. Using targeted interviews in key stakeholder groups, we assessed the progress made toward this goal through three different pathways over a sixyear period: i) capacity building; ii) partnership and collaboration; and iii) sustainable resource management. Results showed that the formal Government adoption of Peskas was a tipping point that catalysed greater intragovernmental collaboration, as well as between government and communities, and brought new investment into the fisheries sector. However, Peskas has had minimal impact on the development of new regulations to date. We discuss reasons for this, such as an inadequate fisheries legal framework and wider capacity gaps and draw broader recommendations for how to leverage digital transformation for positive change in fisheries sustainability.

AB  - Determination of appropriate effluent quality limits (EQL) for wastewater treatment plants in China is a complicated process involving multiple factors that need joint consideration. Based on advantages of compiling the energy and material flows as well as the emissions into air, water and soil, life cycle assessment (LCA) presents a standardized approach for evaluation of EQL alternatives. However, challenges arise when incorporating more factors is indispensable, especially for the elements concerning downstream receiving water body, official water shed planning and stakeholder's participation. To this end, an integrated LCA-based decision-support platform named HIT.WATER scheme is proposed, linking the currently available LCA system with Water Quality Model (WQM), Plackett-Burman (PB) design and Conjoint Analysis (CA). A demonstrative case study was conducted to illustrate the processing procedures. Results obtained in the current study show that the officially defined river functions and the downstream cross-section distances resulted in more significant effects on the assessment outcome than other factors such as self-purification coefficients and weighting factors. Nevertheless, the comparisons among EQL alternatives were carried out and the differences were observed, which were dynamic, varying with the changed conditions of either natural factors (e.g. downstream distances) or human factors (e.g. officially defined river functions). Quantitatively presenting the dynamic comparisons to indicate the differences among the alternatives was a principal function of the HIT.WATER scheme. In particular, the approach allows the environmental impacts of EQL examined from various perspectives, which is conducive to the preclusion of "one-size-fits-all" determination with sustainability consideration. Stakeholder's participation was achieved through a transparent decision-making process, and their selection and judgment criterion could be explicitly presented using quantitative metrics. We conclude that the HIT.WATER scheme can be applied to broader scales where the evaluation of paradigm shifts (technological advancement or effluent standard changes) in sewage systems is necessary.

AB  - PurposeIn today's world, empowering individuals, promoting social cohesion and advancing economic development all hinge on access to high-quality education, prioritizing diversity, inclusion and equality. Rethinking current educational strategies using cyber-physical learning assets is necessary to accommodate the learning inclusivity and equity and escalating demands of a globalized world. There is a pressing demand for evidence to support the efficacy of collaborative learning in transforming curriculum and fostering learner inclusion. However, it is recognized as a pedagogical technique within the quality education domain. This study aims to address this knowledge gap by investigating how hybridized cybergogy paradigms facilitate collaborative learning, focusing on diversity, equity and inclusion, to improve educational quality in higher education.Design/methodology/approachThis study used a qualitative approach with an exploratory design guided by an interpretive philosophical perspective. The data was gathered from 60 prospective teachers from the public sector university of Sindh, Pakistan. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with participants.

AB  - IntroductionCall and recall systems provide actionable intelligence to improve equity and timeliness of childhood vaccinations, which have been disrupted during the COVID-19 pandemic. We will evaluate the effectiveness, fidelity and sustainability of a data-enabled quality improvement programme delivered in primary care using an Active Patient Link Immunisation (APL-Imms) call and recall system to improve timeliness and equity of uptake in a multiethnic disadvantaged urban population. We will use qualitative methods to evaluate programme delivery, focusing on uptake and use, implementation barriers and service improvements for clinical and non-clinical primary care staff, its fidelity and sustainability.Methods and analysisThis is a mixed-methods observational study in 284 general practices in north east London (NEL). The target population will be preschool-aged children eligible to receive diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTaP) or measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccinations and registered with an NEL general practice. The intervention comprises an in-practice call and recall tool, facilitation and training, and financial incentives. The quantitative evaluation will include interrupted time Series analyses and Slope Index of Inequality. The primary outcomes will be the proportion of children receiving at least one dose of a DTaP-containing or MMR vaccination defined, respectively, as administered between age 6 weeks and 6 months or between 12 and 18 months of age. The qualitative evaluation will involve a 'Think Aloud' method and semistructured interviews of stakeholders to assess impact, fidelity and sustainability of the APL-Imms tool, and fidelity of the implementation by facilitators.Ethics and disseminationThe research team has been granted permission from data controllers in participating practices to use deidentified data for audit purposes. As findings will be specific to the local context, research ethics approval is not required. Results will be disseminated in a peer-reviewed journal and to stakeholders, including parents, health providers and commissioners.

AB  - Engaging diverse stakeholders in dialogue around sustainable development has proven to be a successful strategy to advance sustainable development goals. Without local engagement, sustainable development efforts can fail to accomplish their objectives. Yet, determining the best strategy for engaging diverse stakeholders can be challenging. Similarly challenging can be the transfer of information regarding successful development strategies from one community to another. Local specificity is key to finding sustainable development solutions. Yet, knowledge creation one-community-at-a-time is time consuming and limits the transferability of knowledge. Meso-level approaches are therefore essential to finding transferable solutions. The Five-Pillars approach to development is such a meso-level mixed methods approach. It identifies a manageable set of indicators in five common categories: education, health, environmental quality, social and cultural amenities, and information and transportation access. These indicator categories form the basis for selecting specific locations within a community where local stakeholders engage in writing a collective story about their sustainable development future. This article describes the implementation of the Five Pillars approach in two neighborhoods in Washington D.C. It concludes that the approach offers an effective engagement strategy that gives voice to the sustainable development vision of local stakeholders while providing a framework that can benefit diverse communities.

AB  - In China, dockless bike-sharing programs (DBSPs) play a significant role in promoting the goals of sustainable urban travel and carbon emissions reduction. However, the sustainability of DBSPs is increasingly being challenged as various issues associated with different stakeholders emerge. While numerous studies have focused on the barriers to traditional bike-sharing programs, the sustainability performance of new-generation DBSPs is largely overlooked. It is accordingly imperative to understand the primary challenges that impede the sustainability of DBSPs and to consider what stimulative measures can be taken. In this study, we investigate the factors that are critical to DBSPs' sustainability from a network perspective. Stakeholder-associated factors and their interrelations were identified via literature analysis and interviews, and the social network analysis (SNA) method was employed to recognize the critical factors and links in DBSPs. As a result, 10 critical factors and 10 major interactions were identified and further classified into six challenges. Sharing transport schemes, legislative perfection, public private partnership (PPP), and product lifecycle management (PLM) were proposed to govern these challenges. This paper contributes to the existing body of knowledge of bike-sharing programs via a network approach that integrates the key influencing factors with those factors' associated stakeholders. Furthermore, these findings provide the government and operators with implications for mitigating the tough challenges and facilitating the sustainability of DBSPs.

AB  - Addressing complex socio-ecological challenges, from climate change to biodiversity loss, requires collaborative co-creation and application of knowledge that bridges disciplines and diverse research communities. New models of research training are needed that emphasize these competencies and are inclusive of students from underrepresented groups in academia. This article presents learnings from a 2 -year pilot project at the University of British Columbia in which we created a new course-based undergraduate interdisciplinary research experience in socio-ecological systems designed to address these twin problems. We evaluated the linkages between pedagogical design, achievement of sustainability research competencies, and overcoming barriers to research participation. We find that mentored and scaffolded learning-by-doing supported by peer group-based learning was successful in catalyzing transformative interdisciplinary learning for students. Our results emphasize the importance of scaffolding at multiple levels to remove barriers to accessing a first research experience and providing an introductory opportunity for students to build research self-efficacy and better equip students for independent research. Shifting toward pedagogies that build sustainability-related competencies and that remove barriers to access is high-reward and thus requires institutional support and investment.

AB  - Sustainability transformations are considered to provide pathways to solve current wicked problems, although empirical approaches to assess their actual transformative potential are still limited. In this study, we analyse a diverse set of 129 sustainability innovations in two Biosphere Reserves in Germany and France (SchorfheideChorin and Fontainebleau-Gatinais), based on an analytical framework that characterises innovations through actors, processes and outcomes. With a hierarchical cluster analysis conducted on innovation outcomes, we identify six archetypes: Participative Transformation Governance, New Sectors for Social-ecological Transformations, Social and Sustainable Entrepreneurs, Social Innovations, Service Innovations and Technological Efficiency Innovations. The most transformative archetype, Participative Transformation Governance, targets both shallow and deep leverage points, while implementing diverse amplifying strategies to enhance impacts. The least transformative archetypes, e.g. Service Innovations, target shallow leverage points and lack amplifying strategies. Our archetype approach thus proves suitable for capturing a diverse range of sustainability innovations and characterising their transformative outcomes. Synergies between archetypes could be identified and further research should elaborate on the bridging role of Biosphere Reserves to best use synergies and enhance transformative processes.

AB  - The purpose of the present study is to identify the vital indicators of environmental sustainability (EN) that are utilised in the manufacturing sector. Identifying vital indicators of environmental sustainability in manufacturing becomes important due to the large uneven number of indicators for sustainability assessment. The research work identifies and proposes a list of vital indicators of environmental sustainability (EN) through exhaustive review of the literature using statistical technique of decision-making 'Pareto Analysis'. Further, these indicators were prioritised and ranked with the help of the Best-Worst method, which is a new multi-criteria decision-making technique. This technique is implemented to rank and arrange the ENs in accordance with their criticality by assigning them a weight. This work will be helpful in successful implementation and/or evaluation of sustainability assessment particularly in manufacturing industries in India. This research work may be helpful to the academicians, researchers and other concerned stakeholders, in order to understand the severity, importance, implementation, and success of sustainability practices.

AB  - Cross-cultural collaborative learning in different learning domains is the road to the sustainability of economic, social, and environmental development. It creates the appropriate environment to acquire cross-cultural communication and collaboration skills for the 21st century. This study conducted a systematic review of 54 articles on cross-cultural collaborative learning published from 2011 to 2020. Based on the proposed analysis framework, the major elements of cross-cultural collaborative learning are revealed, including learners, group composition, learning environment, cross-cultural learning content, collaborative learning strategies, and research designs. The results indicated that most studies engaged learners at the university level and adopted small group sizes in cross-cultural collaborative learning activities. The online learning environment and social science learning content were widely employed in the past 10 years. Most studies adopted multiple collaborative learning strategies and lasted for 9 to 24 weeks. Most studies targeted mixed research purposes and adopted the qualitative analysis method. The findings and relevant suggestions for future studies are discussed in depth.

AB  - With rapid urban expansion and the increasing demand of industrial development, the existing industrial zones require transformation and upgrading to achieve the sustainable development of society, economy, and environment. The green transformation of industrial zones lacks overall theoretical guidance and a systematic evaluation system. This research aims at developing effective methods to integrate the elements of existing industrial zones within the same framework for the purpose of optimizing the sustainability of the whole system. In this study, the connotation of a composite ecosystem in existing industrial zones was analyzed using the theory of sustainable development, and an evaluation model of existing industrial zone was constructed. Taking the green transformation of Chongqing Gepai Wire and Cable Co., Ltd. as an example, the sustainability of land, architecture, industry, ecology, landscape, culture, and other elements has been fully considered in the transformation process. Through the evaluation results, it can be seen that the sustainability of all aspects of the industrial zone have been effectively improved, which is 16% to 40% higher than that before the transformation. The research results illustrate that, in the process of the green transformation of industrial zones, using interdisciplinary methods to select indicators and dynamically evaluate the sustainable development of industrial zones can systematically and comprehensively consider the elements of industrial zones and promote the role of various majors in the transformation of industrial zones.

AB  - The globalization of markets provides opportunities for firms to collaborate on various activities. These collaborations are the resource of social capital for firms to achieve sustainable competitiveness. This study aims to investigate how social capital (i.e., structural, relational, and cognitive social capital) between firms in a developing economy and developed economy strengthens their innovation capability and enhance their industry 4.0 readiness. Using Smart PLS-SEM to analyse the data collected from 320 managers representing 81 manufacturing firms in Pakistan, we found that social capital is positively associated with industry 4.0 readiness, and innovative capability mediates this relationship. The study contributes to the existing knowledge of understanding industry 4.0 readiness and provides useful insights for firms in developing economy to improves their innovation capability during the industry 4.0 era. This study likewise reveals the significance of three dimensions of social capital, which can facilitate to bring in digital knowledge from developed economies to developed economies to get ready for the fourth industrial revolution.

AB  - Although social media is widely recognized as necessary for promoting sustainable food consumption, the theoretical essence of its social influence has yet to be clarified. This research establishes a mutually beneficial model for sustainable food consumption, drawing on Social Influence Theory and Value Theory. The study collected data from an online survey of 15 experts in sustainable food and 311 consumers and analyzed it through a hybrid three-stage approach of fuzzy Delphi, PLS-SEM, and ANN. The results indicate that subjective norms, group norms, and social identity positively influence egoistic and altruistic values, promoting sustainable food consumption. In comparison, social identity has a more important impact on sustainable food consumption, followed by subjective norms and group norms. Usage and value barriers are the main obstacles to sustainable consumption in China, with value barriers moderating the relationship between altruistic value and sustainable food consumption. This study offers innovative approaches to leveraging information technology for achieving sustainable development goals. It holds substantial practical value for stakeholders, including food marketers, government policymakers, and social advocates, providing actionable insights into optimizing marketing strategies, implementing policy incentives, and promoting a culture of sustainable food consumption.

AB  - The spread of the COVID-19 pandemic has generated a health crisis and repetitive lockdowns that disrupted different economic and societal segments. As the world has placed hope on the vaccination progress to bring back the socioeconomic "normal," this article explores how the bioeconomy can enhance the resilience and sustainability of biobased, food, and energy systems in the post-COVID-19 era. The proposed recovery approach integrates technological innovations, environment, ecosystem services, "biocities," food, rural economies, and tourism. The importance of integrating culture, arts, and the fashion industry as part of the recovery is underlined towards building a better bioeconomy that, together with environmental safeguards, promotes socio-cultural and economic innovations. This integration could be achieved supporting communities and stakeholders to diversify their activities by combining sustainable production with decarbonization, stimulating private investments in this direction and monitoring the resulting impact of mitigation measures. Food systems should become more resilient in order to allow adapting rapidly to severe crises and future shocks, while it is important to increase circularity towards the valorization of waste, the integration of different processes within the biorefinery concept and the production of bio-based products and biofuels.

AB  - School collaboration has become a popular approach for education improvement in global education reform. This study examined the dynamics of stakeholder school collaboration in China to improve public education using a case study focused on an Education Group government initiative in Chengdu, China. Frist an introduction to a global reform for education improvement through school collaboration is given, followed by a review of global reform for school collaboration and Hargreaves and Shirley's discussion on design and innovation for school networks and collaboration to visualize the framework for the interpretation of the stakeholders' school collaborative interactions. Then, the school collaboration for education improvement in China is examined in detail based on 20 interviews with stakeholders from educational authorities, the lead and member schools involved in the establishment of the Education Groups in Chengdu, China. The interviews were designed based on a review of policy documents about construction of the Education Groups in Chengdu. The findings revealed that the establishment of the Education Groups in Chengdu was driven by both top-down initiatives and bottom-up innovations, and while there had been some success in improving education quality in the lower performing schools, the stakeholder interactions had been hindered by the lack of policy coordination within and beyond the education reforms. It was concluded that a collective institutional context was needed to foster the shared values and trust needed between all stakeholders and promote the sustainable reform of the Education Groups to ensure education equity and quality.

AB  - Ocean ecosystems are at the forefront of the climate and biodiversity crises, yet we lack a unified approach to assess their state and inform sustainable policies. This blueprint is designed around research capabilities and cross-sectoral partnerships. We highlight priorities including integrating basin-scale observation, modelling and genomic approaches to understand Atlantic oceanography and ecosystem connectivity; improving ecosystem mapping; identifying potential tipping points in deep and open ocean ecosystems; understanding compound impacts of multiple stressors including warming, acidification and deoxygenation; enhancing spatial and temporal management and protection. We argue that these goals are best achieved through partnerships with policy-makers and community stakeholders, and promoting research groups from the South Atlantic through investment and engagement. Given the high costs of such research (euro800k to euro1.7M per expedition and euro30-40M for a basin-scale programme), international cooperation and funding are integral to supporting science-led policies to conserve ocean ecosystems that transcend jurisdictional borders.
   Capacity building and engagement are crucial to support science-led sustainable ocean policies that are integrated, interdisciplinary and internationally collaborative as well as being effective at a range of temporal and spatial scales.

AB  - The making of international space law has stalled for four decades. As the exploitation and use of space resources is likely to begin in the near future, an international legal framework is needed to regulate these activities. On 12 November 2019, the Hague Space Resources Governance Working Group adopted the Building Blocks (the BB), which laid the groundwork for international discussions on the potential development of an international framework on space resources activities. The BB highlights several developments intended to create an environment that will facilitate these activities. This article examines the BB's new elements, with an emphasis on commercial incentives, priority rights, resource rights, safety zones, promoting participation by all countries, sharing of monetary and nonmonetary benefits, sustainable development, and ecocentrism. The article finds that the BB is progressive in terms of providing for legal certainty and predictability, coordination among states, benefits sharing, and protection and preservation of the space environment. The study also argues that the BB is a starting point for the future international legal framework, although other mechanisms are also needed to safeguard the interests of developing states.

KW  - STI (science, technology and innovation)
KW  - Sustainable development

AB  - The contribution of scientific knowledge and innovation to sustainability is demonstrated. Theory, discoveries, programmes and activities in both the natural as well as social sciences fields have greatly helped with the environmental, economic and social challenges of the past and current centuries, especially in the past 50 years or so. Nowadays, we increasingly realize the intimate link between science and society, and the need not only for science to inform policy but also to address requests by governments and the multiple stakeholders confronted with the challenge to achieve sustainable development. Current barriers to how science is conceived and related education is delivered hamper true interdisciplinarity, and the emerging field of sustainability science attempts inter alia to clarify how 'a new generation of science' can be designed so as to promote more integrated thinking to tackle complex societal issues. At the international level, and more specifically in the context of the United Nations, the practice of science has always entailed the need to solve problems such as climate change, ozone depletion, disaster risk, lack of food security, biodiversity loss, social instability and ineffective governance-to cite a few. In this regard, science in an intergovernmental context is by definition science that has to assist with the struggle for sustainability. Yet, a higher level of integration and cross-fertilization among disciplines as well as of participation among concerned stakeholders in the design and implementation of science-based programmes and activities carried out by the United Nations (and, in this article, the specific case of its Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization-UNESCO-is presented) seems to be needed. The debate on sustainability science carried out in the academic circle and the experience of UNESCO in this area can be mutually supportive in further elucidating how, practically, the approach of sustainability science can enhance the achievement of sustainable development at multiple scales.

AB  - Urban regeneration forms a key approach for coping with persistent sustainability problems in cities. In practice, however, it is often driven by motives other than sustainability transformation. This paper explores the preconditions that allow urban regeneration approaches to become transformative, and suggests a methodology to support this shift in practice. It does so by assessing the capacity available to prepare for, initiate, and steer a path-deviant sustainability transformation of urban areas in three South Korean cities, jointly with stakeholders. The findings reflect how local policy largely supports a conservative development pathway, favored by national government, sidelining especially ecological implications. Major deficits exist regarding systems thinking, sustainability foresight, and social learning processes, while collective visioning, intermediation, community empowerment, and repositioning science could become instant drivers. In conclusion, assessing transformative capacity offers a crucial lever to design urban-regeneration approaches for unlearning dominant development paradigms and to experimentally reconfigure urban social-ecological-technological systems.

AB  - The paper introduces a holistic framework that identifies the links between energy and other systems (water, land, environment, finance, etc.), and measures the impact of energy portfolios, to offer a solid foundation for the best sustainable decision making in energy planning. The paper presents a scenario-based holistic nexus tool, Energy Portfolio Assessment Tool (EPAT) that provides a platform for energy stakeholders and policymakers to create and evaluate the sustainability of various scenarios based on the water-energy-food (WEF) nexus approach. The tool is applied to a case study in Texas, USA. Scenarios considered are set by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA): EIA Reference Case - 2015, EIA Clean Power Plan (CPP) & Reference Case - 2030, and EIA No-CPP & Reference Case - 2030. In the presence of the CPP, total water withdrawal is expected to decrease significantly, while total water consumption is projected to experience a slight decrease due to the increase in water consumption in electricity generation caused by the newelectricity mix. The CPP is successful in decreasing emissions, but is accompanied by tradeoffs, such as increased water consumption and land use by electricity generation. The absence of the CPP will lead to an extreme surge in total water withdrawn and consumed, and in emissions. Therefore, conservation policies shouldmove from the silo to the nexus mentality to avoid unintended consequences that result in improving one part of the nexus while worsening the other parts.

AB  - The paradigm of design is changing. Designers now need to be equipped with the skills and knowledge that will enable them to participate in the global move towards a sustainable future. The challenges arise as Design for Sustainability deals with very complex and often contradictory issues. Collaborative learning experiences recognise that these complex issues can be addressed with the pooling of diverse knowledge, perspectives, cultures, skills and tools. Unless, however the process of collaboration is explored in detail, the opportunity for reflection, learning and improvement is lost. This paper proposes that by introducing and analysing collaboration within third level design education, the capacity for responsible design practice can be developed, leading to a transformative shift in how designers are taught as students and subsequently practice as professionals. Over two multidisciplinary projects devised and undertaken by design students from the University of Limerick (Ireland), Hogeschool Utrecht (Netherlands) and Virginia Commonwealth University (USA), the collaborative path is mapped and critical junctions identified. From this process of mapping and visualisation, collective narratives of the overall project experience are constructed (through the eyes of the participants and planners). This leads to a greater understanding and appreciation of the benefits and limitations of the collaborative experience.

AB  - Effective engagement is crucial for enhancing environmental decision-making processes, fostering more sustainable and equitable outcomes. However, the success of engagement is highly variable and context-dependent. While theoretical frameworks have been developed to explain outcome variance in engagement in environmental decision-making, they have not yet been tested in digital contexts, leaving their applicability to digital engagement processes unclear. More broadly, there are unanswered questions about the effectiveness of digital tools in achieving the goals of engagement, which have become increasingly pertinent amidst growing concerns about the potential of digital technologies for exacerbating exclusions, ethical issues, and systematically undermining democratic progress. This paper addresses this evidence gap by presenting findings from interviews with practitioners in UK public, private, and third sector organisations. Our results provide empirical insights into the technical, ethical, and inclusivity debates surrounding digital tools and their effectiveness in promoting accessible engagement, high-quality social interaction, place-based decision-making, and more trustworthy and credible outcomes. Our findings indicate that while current engagement theories are applicable to digital environments, the key explanatory factors acquire new dimensions in digital compared to in-person contexts. Drawing on the findings, this study contributes novel insights to expand current theory for explaining "what works" in engagement in environmental decisions, enhancing its relevance and applicability in the digital age. The paper concludes with evidence-led recommendations for environmental practitioners to improve engagement processes in digital and remote settings.

AB  - Given the ongoing socio-ecological crises, higher education institutions need curricular interventions to support students in developing the knowledge, skills, and perspectives needed to create a sustainable future. Campus farms are increasingly becoming sites for sustainability and environmental education toward this end. This paper describes the design and outcomes of a farm-situated place-based experiential learning (PBEL) intervention in two undergraduate biology courses and one environmental studies course over two academic years. We conducted a mixed-method study using pre/post-surveys and focus groups to examine the relationship between the PBEL intervention and students' sense of place and expressions of pro-environmentalism. The quantitative analysis indicated measurable shifts in students' place attachment and place-meaning scores. The qualitative findings illustrate a complex relationship between students' academic/career interests, backgrounds, and pro-environmentalism. We integrated these findings to generate a model of sustainability learning through PBEL and argue for deepening learning to encourage active participation in socio-ecological change.

TI  - Transitional Justice and Peacebuilding after Mass Violence
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE
LA  - English
AB  - Since the end of the Cold War, the international community has become increasingly involved in peacebuilding and transitional justice after mass violence. This article uses lessons from practical experience and theories of peacebuilding and transitional justice to develop a model of transformative justice that supports sustainable peacebuilding. This model is holistic and transdisciplinary and proposes a focus on civil society participation in the design and implementation of transitional justice mechanisms. It requires us to rethink our focus on 'transition' as an interim process that links the past and the future, and to shift it to 'transformation,' which implies long-term, sustainable processes embedded in society and adoption of psychosocial, political and economic, as well as legal, perspectives on justice. It also involves identifying, understanding and including, where appropriate, the various cultural approaches to justice that coexist with the dominant western worldview and practice. A syncretic approach to reconciling restorative and retributive justice is proposed as a contribution to developing transformative justice and sustainable peacebuilding. The development of this transformative justice model is informed by field research conducted in Cambodia, Rwanda, East Timor and Sierra Leone on the views and experiences of conflict participants in relation to transitional justice and peacebuilding.

AB  - Effective global collaboration is crucial to achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It requires an understanding of the needs of individual countries and their expectations related to bioeconomy. With the aim to explore the prospective developments in the global bioeconomy over the next 20 years, the German Bioeconomy Council, an independent advisory body to the German Federal Government, commissioned BIOCOM-AG to invite experts from around the globe to share their insights in a global expert survey. The survey was conducted online in autumn 2017. 345 experts from 46 countries completed the questionnaire about future developments and strategies in the global bioeconomy. As claimed by the experts, the upcoming bioeconomy must primarily meet humanity's needs in the energy, agriculture, and food sectors. Moreover, innovative products based on renewable resources are anticipated to be of great importance. Even though all UN SDGs will be affected by future bioeconomy success stories, five SDGs stood out within the sample: SDG 12: 'responsible consumption and production'; SDG 9: 'industry, innovation and infrastructure'; SDG 13: 'climate action'; SDG 7: 'affordable and clean energy'; and SDG 11: 'sustainable cities and communities'. About three quarters of the experts emphasized the need to specifically address three conflicting goals in any future bioeconomy strategy: non-food uses of arable land, use of crop land to produce feedstock for meat, milk and egg production and, finally, the conversion of virgin forests into agricultural land. Most experts stated that reducing food loss and waste is crucial to eradicating the world hunger problem. The proposed solutions relied greatly on innovation and technological development. Bioeconomy expertise and know-how should be shared in close cooperation between developed and developing economies to reach UN SDGs. A supportive political framework would be the ultimate goal towards furthering the progress of a future bioeconomy all over the world.

AB  - As the magnitude, complexity, and urgency of many sustainability problems increase, there is a growing need for universities to contribute more effectively to problem solving. Drawing upon prior research on social-ecological systems, knowledge-action connections, and organizational innovation, we developed an integrated conceptual framework for strengthening the capacity of universities to help society understand and respond to a wide range of sustainability challenges. Based on experiences gained in creating the Senator George J. Mitchell Center for Sustainability Solutions (Mitchell Center), we tested this framework by evaluating the experiences of interdisciplinary research teams involved in place-based, solutions-oriented research projects at the scale of a single region (i.e., the state of Maine, USA). We employed a multiple-case-study approach examining the experiences of three interdisciplinary research teams working on tidal energy development, adaptation to climate change, and forest vulnerability to an invasive insect. Drawing upon documents, observations, interviews, and other data sources, three common patterns emerged across these cases that were associated with more effective problem-solving strategies. First, an emphasis on local places and short-term dynamics in social-ecological systems research provides more frequent opportunities for learning while doing. Second, iterative stakeholder engagement and inclusive forms of knowledge co-production can generate substantial returns on investment, especially when researchers are dedicated to a shared process of problem identification and they avoid framing solutions too narrowly. Although these practices are time consuming, they can be accelerated by leveraging existing stakeholder relationships. Third, efforts to mobilize interdisciplinary expertise and link knowledge with action are facilitated by an organizational culture that emphasizes mutual respect, adaptability, and solutions. Participation of faculty associated with interdisciplinary academic programs, solutions-oriented fields, and units with partnership-oriented missions hastens collaboration within teams and between teams and stakeholders. The Mitchell Center also created a risk-tolerant culture that encouraged organizational learning. Solutions-focused programs at other universities can potentially benefit from the lessons we learned.

AB  - The implication of the Covid-19 global pandemic is driving the transition of SMEs' business towards digitalization. However, despite the use of the digital platform, many SMEs are unable to survive. Therefore, this study included a focus on Decision Support System (DSS)-based dashboard model as a new feature in assessing SMEs' digitalization readiness. The twentyfour criteria appraisals are regarded in this sense as two views of business and Information Technology (IT) dimensions which include the Fuzzy-Analytical Hierarchy Process Method (F-AHP) for the weighting measurement and Objective Matrix (OMAX) for the performance mapping analysis, and both are embedded in the Business Intelligent (BI) dashboard development. In Riau Province, Indonesia, a total of 118 SMEs were interested in this study and fact thus revealed the general performance of SMEs as rated at an "Average" level of index value 4.95 with comprehensive parameters for index contribution viz., 3.79, 3.84, 7.75, 4.68, 4.32, and 5.43 for Business Activity (BA), Transaction (TC), Marketing (MC), Management (MG), Micro Environment (MI) and Macro Environment (MA) respectively. Furthermore, the dashboard prepares a tracking and analysis system with the graphical diagram extracted from each criteria hierarchy's root cause to sub-criteria. The DSS dashboard's information and knowledge have been developed into a promotional framework for stakeholders relevant to a digital business's success and sustainability performance initiatives.

AB  - This paper analyzes students' perceptions of how teaching-learning methods influence the promotion of higher education students' social innovation competencies based on a sustainability framework. We focus our analysis on Spain using 'Spanish Universities Involvement in Social Innovation Activities' (SUISIA) data, collected in 2021. For the long list of 19 competencies available in our sample of 349 students, we identify those competencies associated with social innovation and categorize them as organizational, entrepreneurial and collaborative. We then employ different statistical models to identify which teaching-learning methods facilitate the development of social innovation competencies. We also consider variables such as student characteristics and field of study program. Our results suggest a lack of implementation of active teaching-learning approaches which leads to poor development of organizational, entrepreneurial and collaborative competencies, particularly in engineering studies in comparison to other disciplines. This suggests a gap between higher education and society's demands in students' preparation for and engagement in a complex and dynamic future aimed at achieving the sustainable development goals outlined in Agenda 2030.

KW  - Immersive learning
AB  - This study investigates how technological and pedagogical factors influence students' intention to engage with virtual worlds on educational metaverse platforms and examines the resulting learning outcomes in sustainability education. Traditional sustainability education often fails to effectively engage students with real-world challenges. Metaverse platforms provide immersive, interactive environments that bridge theoretical knowledge with practical application but face usability, complexity, and user comfort issues that can hinder engagement and learning. Using a mixed-methods approach, 54 undergraduate students from Hong Kong and the Philippines participated in sustainability modules via the Classlet metaverse platform. Regression analysis revealed that Ease of Use, Enjoyment, Perceived Performance, and Immersion accounted for 77.1% of the variance in intent to engage. Ease of Use and Enjoyment were the strongest positive predictors, while higher Immersion negatively impacted VR users, indicating that excessive complexity reduces usability. Additionally, gaming experience influenced enjoyment, with weekly gamers reporting higher engagement. Desktop users showed the highest intent to use the platform, whereas VR users experienced greater immersion but also more discomfort. Qualitative feedback highlighted the platform's engaging and innovative features alongside technical and navigational challenges affecting learning outcomes. These findings highlight the need to balance interactivity, usability, and adaptability in educational technologies. Recommendations include implementing adaptive learning pathways, enhancing onboarding processes, and offering customizable interaction levels to accommodate diverse learner needs. Refining immersive learning approaches can better connect theoretical concepts with real-world sustainability applications, fostering increased student engagement and improved learning outcomes.

AB  - In response to attempts to establish unsustainable projects (fracking and hydroelectric plants) in an indigenous community in the Mexican humid tropics, this study aims to empower its citizenry using knowledge about the local biophysical and social environment and its associated problems, raising awareness of how to help solve these problems, and actively working towards their solution. Action Research and Community Problem-Solving was used to design a participatory rural appraisal workshop to analyze the situation from a cultural, biological and legal perspective in order to promote sustainable development on a human scale. The results of this research show that the Totonac community in the municipality of Huehuetla has deep knowledge about their environment and a close relationship with the land and the natural world. Despite this biological and cultural wealth, there are problems with disturbance and marginalization in the region, with a big part of the problem being a lack of autonomy in the community's management of its own resources. The final outcome of the workshops was a community action plan that managed to stop the implementation of development projects that threatened the native culture and its biocultural heritage. The educational model proposed proved to be useful in empowering the citizenry to confront the development of unsustainable projects. It also provided insight as to the formation of a new social base in which coexistence between indigenous and non-indigenous people is possible. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In recent years, green building has drawn the attention of both academics and practitioners and experienced rapid growth. In order to achieve the concept of sustainable development in the project life cycle of green building, a holistic approach to green practice is needed. Unlike traditional construction approaches, adopting the green practice approach calls for more cohesive collaborations among different stakeholders. This study aims to elicit a better understanding of how green practice influences collaborative work (CW). Data were collected through green technical documents of several real-life projects and interviews with owners, contractors, designers, cost estimators, and government officials in China. A conceptual framework for determining the structure and content of the impact of green practice in CW was mapped; four potential conflicts were identified. Further analysis was used to explore the mitigation strategies that could be used to make CW particularly suitable for green building implementation. The study will help stakeholders identify their objectives and to strategically facilitate a more collaborative work environment. (C) 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Purpose and context This paper aims to establish principles for the increased application and use of life cycle sustainability assessment (LCSA). Sustainable development (SD) encompassing resilient economies and social stability of the global system is growingly important for decision-makers from business and governments. The "17 SDGs" emerge as a high-level shared blueprint for peace, abundance, and prosperity for people and the planet, and "sustainability" for supporting improvements of products and organizations. A "sustainability" interpretation-successful in aligning stakeholders' understanding-subdivides the impacts according to a triple bottom line or three pillars: economic, social, and environmental impacts. These context and urgent needs inspired the LCSA framework. This entails a sustainability assessment of products and organizations in accordance with the three pillars, while adopting a life cycle perspective. Methods The Life Cycle Initiative promotes since 2011 a pragmatic LCSA framework based on the three techniques: LCSA = environmental life cycle assessment (LCA) + life cycle costing (LCC) + social life cycle assessment (S-LCA). This is the focus of the paper, while acknowledging previous developments. Identified and reviewed literature shows challenges of addressing the three pillars in the LCSA framework implementation like considering only two pillars; not being fully aligned with ISO 14040; lacking interconnectedness among the three pillars; not having clear criteria for results' weighting nor clear results' interpretation; and not following cause-effect chains and mechanisms leading to an endpoint. Agreement building among LCSA experts and reviewing processes strengthened the consensus on this paper. Broad support and outreach are ensured by publishing this as position paper. Results For harmonizing practical LCSA applications, easing interpretation, and increasing usefulness, consensed ten LCSA principles (10P) are established: understanding the areas of protection, alignment with ISO 14040, completeness, stakeholders' and product utility considerations, materiality of system boundaries, transparency, consistency, explicit trade-offs' communication, and caution when compensating impacts. Examples were provided based on a fictional plastic water bottle Conclusions In spite of increasing needs for and interest in SD and sustainability supporting tools, LCSA is at an early application stage of application. The 10P aim to promote more and better LCSA applications by ensuring alignment with ISO 14040, completeness and clear interpretation of integrated results, among others. For consolidating its use, however, more consensus-building is needed (e.g., on value-laden ethical aspects of LCSA, interdependencies and interconnectedness among the three dimensions, and harmonization and integration of the three techniques) and technical and policy recommendations for application.

AB  - Complex dynamic interactions exist between urbanization and sustainable urban development, and clarifying the collaborative relationship and interactive response mechanism between the two systems is key to ensuring high-quality urban development. Taking Yangtze River Delta as a typical case, dynamic coordinated and interactive response relationships between urbanization and sustainable urban development were measured using a multi-index comprehensive evaluation method, grey correlation analysis, and panel-data vector autoregressive (PVAR) model. The results indicate that: (a) a high urbanization level and significant polarization characteristics of regional central cities alongside low economic development in more peripheral cities and insufficient attraction to factors including population, capital, and technology, which widens their development gap with regional central cities; (b) a significant increasing trend in sustainable urban development, coupled with a spatiotemporal evolution trend of urbanization; (c) bidirectional Granger causal relationship between urbanization and sustainable urban development, with the PVAR model results indicating a positive interactive response relationship, which has certain path-dependent characteristics and an inertial development trend; and (d) in the long run, urbanization has a greater impact on changes in sustainable urban development than vice versa.

AB  - For recent techno-economic advances in solar energy to enable sustainable energy transformation, society must address institutional inertia and entrenched resistance by powerful stakeholders. Legitimation of power and specific metrics produces institutional authority to govern energy transitions, by reconfiguring accountability relations between situated actors. This article studies how metrics are legitimated and thus analyzes solar energy governance in Portugal. It identifies accountability relations by tracking four practices of legitimation - discursive, bureaucratic, technocratic and financial - in relation to metrics that help perform expertise and authority within changing topographies of power during sectoral transition. The approach unpacks both (i) how metrics modulate the dynamics of shifts and resistance, and (ii) how their insufficient specification privileges a reductive structural understanding of energy sectors. Drawing on expert interviews, desk-based and field observations, the study explicates how up to 2018, solar energy governance in Portugal limited disruptive change, validated incremental change, and left transformative potential untapped.

AB  - Quantitative and qualitative approaches to planning and evaluation in education for sustainable development have often been treated by practitioners from a single research paradigm. This paper discusses the utility of mixed method evaluation designs which integrate qualitative and quantitative data through a sequential transformative process. Sequential mixed method data collection strategies involve collecting data in an iterative process whereby data collected in one phase contribute to data collected in the next. This is done through examples from a programme addressing the 'Reorientation of University Curricula to Address Sustainability (RUCAS): A European Commission Tempus-funded Programme'. It is argued that the two approaches are complementary and that there are significant gains from combining both. Using methods from both research paradigms does not, however, mean that the inherent differences among epistemologies and methodologies should be neglected. Based on this experience, it is recommended that using a sequential transformative mixed method evaluation can produce more robust results than could be accomplished using a single approach in programme planning and evaluation focussed on education for sustainable development.

KW  - MIGRATION
AB  - For several decades, the Lake Chad Basin has served as a challenges in Africa. Between 1963 and the early 1990s, more than 90% of Lake Chad vanished, largely due to environmental stressors and overuse - for farming, fishing, livestock herding, and power generation. The receding Lake has been associated with a complex array of human security concerns, including food insecurity, loss of lives, biodiversity and livelihoods, poverty, droughts, enforced migration, violent conflicts, and terrorism. Since the 1990s, however, thanks in part to local climate resilience, the volume of the Lake has remained fairly stable despite rising temperatures and demography. Yet, trends reveal that armed conflicts and insecurity in the region continue to resurge periodically over the last two decades, derailing prospects for durable peace. The potential gains of adaptation are undermined by severe governance deficits. Drawing from relevant secondary sources, expert opinion interviews, a focus group discussion, and key informant interviews, this paper interrogates this paradox, highlighting the merits and limits of climate resilience for forging durable peace in the Lake Chad Basin. It builds the case for participatory adaptive governance as a more inclusive approach to sustainable conflict transformation in the Anthropocene.

AB  - Purpose Increasing pressure from the stakeholders makes the inclusion and evaluation of sustainable practices in the service supply chain (SSC) inevitable. Therefore, this paper aims to evaluate the sustainability status of a case organization and discover the barrier to sustainability in the SSC. Design/methodology/approach From the literature review, five sustainability dimensions, seventeen attributes and sixty-five subattributes of the SSC are identified. A three-level conceptual model drawn on human perception is developed. The overall sustainability status of the SSC is determined by using the multigrade fuzzy logic approach. The fuzzy concept incorporated helps in overcoming the challenges of vagueness and impreciseness in the responses. The case SSC is a WestIndia-based hospital. Findings The study evaluates the case hospital to be "very sustainable" but far from the "extremely sustainable" level. Six barriers are identified which are reduction in solid waste, compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations, water usage efficiency, training and education of employees, return on investment and safety equipment for employees. These barriers hinder the hospital from achieving an "extremely sustainable" level. Practical implications This paper evaluates, helps the management in identifying the barriers and thus enabling them to work upon these barriers and achieve a greater level of sustainability. Originality/value The sustainability practices adopted in this paper for the evaluation of the sustainability status of the SSC have not been used in previous studies. In this study apart from environmental, social and economic aspects, customer management and health, safety and risk management are also incorporated for evaluating the performance of the SSC which makes this study unique. The proposed model can be taken as a benchmark for evaluating the sustainability performance of any SSC.

AB  - Nigeria is in the advanced development stages of extracting its oil sands resources to boost national revenue and economic prosperity, like other countries in Sub-Saharan Africa including the Republic of Congo and Madagascar. Compared to resource-rich developed countries like Canada and America, the consequences of oil sands extraction is likely to be disastrous in countries like Nigeria that have a poor reputation for managing resources (as is the case with the petroleum sector). Using a mixed-method approachfocus group discussions, interviews and observationsthis paper addresses environmental concerns about oil sands extraction in Nigeria. Overall, the communities perceived oil sands development negatively, because of fears of loss of communal lands, biodiversity, water availability and quality, and pollution. They were angry with the previous administrations over the lack of communication, and were deprived of socio-economic opportunities and pollution from prolonged delays in oil sands extraction. The way forward is to form sustainable partnerships between the government, communities, industry and other stakeholders to achieve responsible oil sands developmentenvironmentally friendly development that meets climate obligations, addresses cumulative impacts, and acts in the best interest of host communities and Nigerians.

AB  - Higher education institutions are increasingly offering Sustainable Food Systems (SFS) degree programs in response to societal demand for training a professional food systems workforce. As a relatively young field, there is a need for clearly articulated learning outcomes (LOs) for SFS education to define student learning through degree programs, design new programs, and evaluate and modify existing programs. New and established SFS programs are often fragmented over multiple academic departments which impedes the development of a coherent and holistic curriculum for approaching the complexity of food topics. Here, we address these needs through the co-creation of adaptable LOs for Baccalaureate degree-level SFS programs which are aligned to a SFS Signature Pedagogy and based on outcomes-based education toward contributing to a solid conceptual basis for SFS education. The SFS Signature Pedagogy is a framework that can be applied to develop students' systemic capacities, including holistic, and pluralistic ways of understanding sustainability challenges, multi-, inter- and trans-disciplinarity, experiential learning, and collective action projects. Our co-design of LOs was based on qualitative content analysis of existing LOs of established SFS programs, a cross-sectional survey with SFS educators and refinement of LOs from feedback in an expert panel. This process resulted in the eight adaptable LOs: (1) systems thinking, (2) critical reflection, (3) diverse ways of knowing, (4) practical application, (5) multi-context communication, (6) teamwork, (7) collective action, and, (8) advocacy for SFS. We anticipate the adaptable LOs proposed here to be applicable for diverse student communities and geographic respectively cultural contexts as well as to provide insight for sustainability-related academic programs toward developing professionals equipped with skills and capacities to address complex challenges.

AB  - Resilient cities have emerged as novel urban ecosystems that respond to the increasing challenges of contemporary urban development. A new methodological approach is needed to measure and assess the degree of resilience of the urban landscape during the ongoing planning process, considering different planning and design scenarios. Based on this consideration, the first attempt of this study was to develop a resilience index that summarizes the application of resilience theory in urban landscape planning. Is geodesign an appropriate tool to assess urban resilience? This was the main research question and the topic of the workshop ''IGC-Resilient City of Belgrade'' at the Faculty of Forestry, University of Belgrade (Master Landscape Studio). The main result of this research is a model for urban resilience assessment with IGC geodesign, which allows to measure scenario changes through developed resilience indicators (index), which are determined by a set of parameters (area, redundancy, diversity, porosity, carbon sequestration, edge type, edge length, etc.). The methodological approach allows quantifying the impact of adopted innovations in geodesign scenario proposals, which plays a crucial role in strengthening the connection between landscape planning and design. In the context of the novel urban ecosystem, future urban landscape planning should focus on resilience as a measure to achieve sustainable development goals, supported by geodesign as a collaborative and spatially explicit negotiation tool.

AB  - The problem of unsustainable development of natural resource markets is a critical challenge to the country's long-term prosperity and global ecological health. China has experienced unprecedented economic growth, but this has come at significant environmental costs. Using a Panel Data model, this study aims to investigate the effectiveness of various policy interventions aimed at "Building Back Greener" in China's natural resource markets over the period 2000-2020. The research focuses on assessing the impact of regulatory measures, market incentives, and public-private partnerships on promoting sustainable practices. The results indicate that a multi-pronged approach, combining strict regulations with market-based incentives, is most promising in enhancing performance and sustainability in natural resource markets. These findings offer valuable insights for policy makers, industry stakeholders, and environmental advocates, highlighting the need for a balanced approach to achieve sustainable development in China and potentially other rapidly developing economies.

AB  - The use of psychedelic substances is increasingly associated with nature-relatedness. We explore whether entheogenic uses of ayahuasca in settings co-produced between Indigenous and Western knowledges may also foster relationality and sustainability transformations across ontology, praxis, and epistemology. A survey with 74 English-speaking individuals who attended Amazonian healing ceremonies at the Takiwasi Center in Peru, along with 11 semi-structured interviews and a discussion circle revealed unexpected personal shifts towards relationality. Beyond the expected increase in nature-relatedness, participants also reported boundary dissolution and changes in their perceptions of self, leading them to experience nature and non-human beings as having spiritual or human-like agency. The blurring of perceived boundaries between themselves and nature also challenged the materialist ontologies in which they had been educated and socialized. In terms of both epistemologies and praxis, co-produced ayahuasca ceremonies enhanced relational thinking and embodiment of relationality. Inner-outer transformations ensued from the post-ceremonial integration of the 'plant's teachings' into participants' daily lives. We discuss our findings' contributions to the emerging field of inner transformations and the relational turn in sustainability. Potential sustainability benefits of scaling plant-based ceremonies need to be measured against their impacts on the Amazon rainforest and its biocultures.
   Relational Thinking: Ceremonial use of ayahuasca, when combining Indigenous and Western knowledge, fosters a shift in thinking that emphasizes connections between people and ecosystems, challenges rigid beliefs, and privileges more intuitive, relational ways of being in the world. This shift supports inner-outer transformations towards sustainability.Inner Transformations Leading to Sustainable Actions: Ayahuasca ceremonies were linked to shifts in lifestyle choices, decreased consumption of environmentally harmful substances, and a stronger inclination towards nature and community living.Indigenous Relationality: Ayahuasca ceremonies co-produced with Indigenous knowledge holders offer insights into reciprocity with non-humans, balanced living, and nurturing relationships, all of which are fundamental for sustainable futures.Ethical Considerations: Responsible and respectful usage of ayahuasca includes considering the sustainability of the plant, the ecosystems it grows in, and the Indigenous cultures sharing their knowledge. Supportive practices and trained guidance should accompany ayahuasca use, ensuring safety and ethical engagement.Knowledge co-production: Sustainability science can inform the design and implementation of co-produced ceremonial spaces and practices to ensure the sustainable inner-outer transformations reported in this study.

AB  - Modern approaches to project management link project success both to sustainability and with the value delivered to project stakeholders. In the final analysis, it is the satisfaction of the identified stakeholders based on the sustainability principle which decides whether a project is successful or not. The value delivered to appropriate stakeholders has to be incorporated in the earliest phases of the project defining process. Otherwise, it may be too late to introduce changes which would allow the right value to be delivered to the right stakeholders. In this paper, we propose that a simulation is used in the phase of project definition to choose such implementation forms for individual project phases or tasks which would facilitate the delivery of the value expected by the stakeholders. Our approach also supports the process of agreeing (among the stakeholders) on the value expected from the project. We show, using a post-factum real-world project case, that the application of a simulation in the predictive project stage may considerably increase the probability of the project's success.

AB  - Environmental pollution of pharmaceuticals arises during drug development, production, use and disposal and can damage ecosystems, increase antimicrobial resistance and generate substantial greenhouse gas emissions. As a result, environmental sustainability of pharmaceuticals is an expanding theme in today's society. Several sustainability assessment methods have been developed for pharmaceuticals, however, most assessments typically consider only parts of the pharmaceutical chain and focus on the burdens of resource use and emissions, defined as the 'footprint'. On the other hand, these assessments usually do not simultaneously consider the societal benefits of pharmaceuticals, called the 'handprint', in addition to the benefit/risk assessment for the patient. Existing sustainability assessments are often limited to traditional impact categories, neglecting other dimensions of sustainability. A comprehensive sustainability assessment should capture more than just the environmental dimension and could thus holistically capture the three pillars of sustainability, i.e., environment, social, and economic. Currently, holistic methods that cover all impacts over the entire life cycle of pharmaceuticals are lacking. The objective of this study is to conceptualise and propose a holistic framework for integrated sustainability assessment of pharmaceuticals, based on the three pillars of sustainability and taking into account both footprint and handprint outcomes. The framework was developed using both top-down (literature search) and bottom-up approaches (stakeholder involvement). Gaps, barriers and opportunities to achieve sustainability are identified. As a result, this holistic framework can be helpful in decision making.

AB  - In this article, the authors aim to reflect on the relationship between collaborative creation and creativity ('co-creativity') within Living Lab (LL) research and innovation in the domain of agri-food systems.While the value of LL is often perceived to be the collaboration among its participants, there is a need to capture and measure the process of co-creation.Co-creativity is indicated by the literature to be a necessary research and collaborative component of social change, as well as for promoting a transformative sustainability agenda.This article uses empirical and primary data collected in the context of the DIVINFOOD project to show the extent to which researchers actively promote, manage and respond to the effects of collaborative creativity within their research. Collaborative creativity is an indispensable component of the co-creation process because it supports collaborative learning. The authors conclude that measuring co-creativity could be an interesting indicator to monitor the development of LLs over time.

AB  - Scholars, politicians, practitioners, and civil society increasingly call for sustainability transformations to cope with urgent social and environmental challenges. In sustainability transformations research, understandings of transformations are often dominated by Western scientific knowledge. Through a systematic literature review, we investigated how indigenous and local knowledge (ILK) is represented in peer-reviewed empirical scientific papers that apply ILK in contexts of transformation, transition, and change. Our results show, first, that all papers applied ILK to confirm and complement scientific knowledge in contexts of environmental, climate, social-ecological, and species change. Only four papers (5%) applied ILK to conduct research on transformations. Second, we identified four research clusters that apply ILK in contexts of transformation, transition, or change in (1) Arctic, (2) terrestrial, (3) coastal, and (4) grass and rangelands environments. These clusters are located along two axes: tropic to Arctic and marine to terrestrial. Finally, our results indicate that indigenous and local understandings of transformations are currently neglected in the scholarly transformations discourse. The reviewed papers do not focus on how indigenous peoples and local communities understand transformations, instead they focus on what changes indigenous peoples and local communities observe and describe, resulting from their daily experiences and activities. We argue that because of its in-depth local, place-based character, ILK can substantially contribute to a more plural understanding of transformations and the assessment of transformative change. We conclude that future research needs to investigate how to gain a more plural understanding of transformations that leads potentially to more inclusive actions toward more just, equitable, and sustainable futures on a local and global level.

AB  - In this study, we present a comprehensive map of a microtidal wave-dominated beach system based on an interdisciplinary sea-land approach and with the purpose of supporting a sustainable and successful beach management. The study area is located in a highly urbanized/industrialized coastal sector of the W side of Cagliari Gulf (S Sardinia, W Mediterranean). In the Main Map (1:15,000 scale), static and dynamic features of the beach system and adjacent inner shelf are divided into thematic sections, including geomorphological elements, bathymetry, sedimentological distribution, benthic habitat (mainly Posidonia oceanica meadow), hydrodynamics and anthropogenic features. The map constitutes an example of multidisciplinary benchmark to allow for long-term planning and management of this highly urbanized beach system. It is able to provide a substantial scientific support to policy-makers towards environmental restoration and sustainable development.

AB  - Green Business Parks (GBPs) are getting an increasing interest from both the private and public sectors since GBPs is a way of achieving more sustainable industrial and business development. However, the adoption of GBPs still encounters impediments because there is a lack of proper project management framework for such projects. Therefore, the objectives of this study are to: (1) investigate and assess the barriers hindering the adoption of GBPs; (2) assess the impact of the barriers on project management goals; and (3) propose feasible solutions for overcoming current barriers and thus promoting the adoption of GBPs. To achieve the objectives, 15 barriers and 21 solutions were identified from a comprehensive literature review. Through a questionnaire survey with 40 experts in Singapore and post survey interviews, the results first revealed that the top three barriers were "perceived higher initial capital costs", "uncertain trade-off between environmental and financial benefits" and "lack of government support". Moreover, the client related barriers had the most significant impacts on three project objectives which are cost, schedule and quality. In addition, all barriers had more impact on project cost than project schedule and quality. In addition, "government's co-funding and incentives for training and technologies", "policies and regulations for green industrial development" and "collaboration with research institutes and firms to study the benefits of GBPs" were identified as most feasible solutions to overcome the significant barriers. The findings of this study not only bridge the gap between knowledge and practice of the developments of GBPs but also provide useful outcomes about barriers and solutions for practitioners to avoid traps and ultimately achieve the sustainable industrial and business development.

AB  - The transition to renewable energy sources is vital for meeting the problems posed by climate change and depleting fossil fuel stocks. A potential approach to improve the effectiveness, dependability, and sustainability of power production systems is renewable energy hybridization, which involves the combination of various renewable energy sources and storage technologies. This paper provides a comprehensive review of integration strategies for hybrid renewable energy systems, focusing on the synergistic combination of solar, wind, hydro, biomass, and other renewable sources with energy storage solutions. Various integration techniques, including technological, economic, and regulatory elements, are investigated to find critical parameters impacting the successful deployment of hybrid renewable energy systems. Case studies and real-world examples are presented to illustrate the benefits and challenges associated with different integration strategies. The manuscript concludes with recommendations for policymakers, researchers, and industry stakeholders to accelerate the adoption of renewable energy hybridization and achieve more sustainable energy future.

AB  - This chapter challenges sustainability researchers to reflect on how they can stimulate social learning and collaborative knowledge production within the research process. Crucially, there are three challenges that need to be addressed: (1) how to increase the transdisciplinary capacity of the research processes that we facilitate; (2) how to integrate academic and non-academic knowledge types more effectively in order to develop common solutions; and (3) how to amend our roles as researchers to enhance the potential for social learning. We respond to these challenges using a conceptual road map that enables researchers to develop their capacity to facilitate more effective and interactive stakeholder dialogue within their research. We then draw on practical experience of using the road map to work with a transdisciplinary group of stakeholders to develop a sustainability assessment toolkit for rural landowners in upland Scotland. The chapter alerts us to the potential for sustainability to adopt a transformative role in social learning processes, facilitating a real-world, problem-focussed approach and combining perspectives and knowledge from a range of academic and non-academic participants.

AB  - There has been considerable hype in Australia recently accompanying the North American-informed Collective Impact (CI) approach and its claims to deliver real transformative social change for individuals and communities. CI actively promotes its principal incentive and distinctive trait, namely to concentrate the energies of its collaborators to achieve real, long-term, measurable and sustainable outcomes, often quoted as a Social Return on Investment (SRoI). Not coincidentally, the rise of CI's visibility has emerged alongside diminishing public funding for social change initiatives, with a corresponding and somewhat belated turn to the philanthropic sector to partially meet this funding shortfall. Early signs across Australia indicate that philanthropic funds are no less driven by a 'value for money' imperative than governments that in turn, has left many lamenting the shift in community organisations working to satisfy donor expectations rather than working with and for local communities. In this context, some serious questions have already been raised about the Collective Impact approach and ambition, particularly how CI can meaningfully engage with long-term disadvantaged local communities and realistically agree on what successful outcomes would look like for such communities. Community cultural development (CCD) would seem to offer a useful counterpoint to the CI approach with its enduring emphasis on authentic process and bottom-up solutions but CCD too has received its own share of criticism for an obsession with process to the exclusion of real and tangible social outcomes. Whatever approach's claims are to be tested, this paper starts from the standpoint that their veracity will only be significant if they can actually demonstrate they are making a difference in our most disadvantaged communities and populations.

AB  - This study contributes to the ongoing discussion on how to attribute and evaluate the contribution of transdisciplinary research to sustainable development. As co-created knowledge is a key product of transdisciplinary research, we tested the hypothesis that the extent to which this knowledge is utilized beyond the project consortia, in different areas - from scientific methods and insights to policy decisions - and across a continuum of geographical scales can be used to identify potential impact pathways. For this purpose, we developed an analytical framework that links the transdisciplinary process to six possible utilization stages, which we used as indicators of the usability of co-created knowledge. We gathered data from 22 research projects active in 36 countries using a survey and semi-structured interviews. Our results show that even during implementation of the projects, co-created knowledge is utilized by multiple actors at different stages, in all areas and at all scales simultaneously, suggesting multiple impact pathways. Project knowledge is predominantly utilized for national-level policymaking, and research partners named co-creation of knowledge with key stakeholders as the most frequently used mechanism for promoting knowledge utilization. Closer analysis revealed different understandings of and approaches to knowledge co-creation. These can be linked to weaker or stronger definitions of transdisciplinarity. The analysis shows that researchers using strong transdisciplinarity approaches typically face challenges in encompassing multiple epistemologies and facilitating dialogue. Some results suggest that inclusion and collaboration in co-creating knowledge can empower actors otherwise excluded. Our research shows that although transdisciplinary projects have nonlinear impact pathways, these can be partially assessed using the proposed analytical framework. Further, our results indicate a link between usability, inclusion, and collaboration in transdisciplinary research. We conclude with the observation that transdisciplinarity and its requirements still need to be better understood by actors within and beyond the research community.

AB  - Retrofitting social housing is key to reaching urgent climate goals. Integrating residents as a stakeholder in retrofit processes can transform social housing into sustainable homes. Residents are experts in the way they live and reliance on techno-optimist approaches to deep energy retrofit fail to utilise their situated knowledge. This research provides new insights into effective retrofit decision-making processes that prioritise social equity alongside environmental goals. Fifteen semi-structured interviews with Housing Association, Architect, and Architect-led cooperative stakeholders in various European locations, were investigated using a thematic analysis, to answer the following research question: "How do stakeholders (not)utilise residents' situated knowledge and expertise in retrofit design?". Five themes were identified in the data, ascending from the least inclusive to most inclusive of resident stakeholders: external factors influence decision-making; building design is the priority; integrated communication between high-level stakeholders and resident stakeholders; importance of social value; and residents have choice. The results identified three key components to sustainable retrofit: (1) architects and passive design-thinking, (2) retrofit technologies should complement passive design, and (3) resident expertise can balance building needs, energy needs, and social needs. Hybrid decision-making processes should prioritise resident stakeholders to address actual needs, avoid tokenism, and ensure residents' central role in internal governance. Results can guide high-level retrofit stakeholders and policy-makers in shaping hybrid retrofit processes and empower social housing residents to engage with retrofitting projects.

AB  - The Digital Transformation (DX) megatrend is fundamentally disrupting and changing the nature of work, business, and industry at a rapid pace. Although the notion of DX has garnered much research interest from practitioners, scholarship on this topic is somehow lagging behind, possibly because of the lack of theoretical frameworks on DX. Recently, most Japanese firms have begun to use diverse digital technologies to sustain their competitive advantages. However, the return of investment on digital technologies has not been as high as expected for some firms. Furthermore, as the visions of Industry 5.0 describe sustainable, resilient, and human-centered future factories that will require smart and resilient capabilities both from next-generation manufacturing systems and human operators, it is necessary to design resilient human-machine collaborations within factories. To this end, this paper presents a research model between DX technologies and scientific problem-solving in terms of deduction, induction, and abduction inference structures as an approach to resilient human-machine collaborations. The purpose of this research is to analyze the difference in the utilization pattern of the digital technology of American, German, and Japanese firms based on three types of decision-making methods. Next, we apply this framework in a comparative case study of two Japanese firms and one German firm, where we find that there is a difference in DX technologies utilization among the Japanese and German firms. We assert that the utilization of IoT technology in the United States and Germany is pursuing IoT with the aim of autonomous control, whereas Japanese firms prioritize robot-human collaboration. Finally, we discuss how our findings contribute to the burgeoning field of resilient human-machine collaborations by showing the distinct roles of deduction, induction, and abduction inference structures. Furthermore, our research contributes to international comparative studies to identify the difference in national IT utilization. Lessons and implications are discussed.

AB  - There are generally no acceptable views on the conservation of biodiversity because there are no known best approaches to that. This has presented a challenge on what and how to conserve in developing countries like Nigeria. This paper used a multi-criteria decision-making model based on the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to elicit experts' opinions on biodiversity conservation approaches and their corresponding conservation targets. The rationality of the experts was checked by measuring their consistency in the decision-making process. A greedy search algorithm based on linear programming application was also used for resource allocation. This technique is holistic and allows the decision maker to consider all pertinent factors. The approach allows policy makers to integrate worldviews; culture; diverse flexibility of concerned communities and other stakeholders in identifying conservation practices to achieve sustainability. In terms of current performance for the biodiversity conservation approaches; the conservation experts rated their performance on Ecosystem-service-based approach high with the priority index of 0.460. Their performances on Area- and Species-based approaches are ranked second and third with priority indexes of 0.288 and 0.252 respectively. Conversely; in the case of expectations; Ecosystem service is the most important with a priority index of 0.438 followed by Area-based with a priority index of 0.353 and Species-based with a priority index of 0.209. The Ecosystem-service based approach has the highest contribution coefficient. Resources are allocated accordingly; in form of capacity building; based on the priorities that were obtained. The research is a rights-based tool for capacity building; and a paradigm shift from the purely scientific approach to decision-making. It is designed to bridge a scientific gap between policy formulation and resource allocation in biodiversity conservation.

AB  - Introduction: There are significant gaps in the accessibility and quality of mental health services around the globe. A wide range of institutions are addressing the challenges, but there is limited reflection and evaluation on the various approaches, how they compare with each other, and conclusions regarding the most effective approach for particular settings. This article presents a framework for global mental health capacity building that could potentially serve as a promising or best practice in the field. The framework is the outcome of a decade of collaborative global health work at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) (Ontario, Canada). The framework is grounded in scientific evidence, relevant learning and behavioural theories and the underlying principles of health equity and human rights.
   Methods: Grounded in CAMH's research, programme evaluation and practical experience in developing and implementing mental health capacity building interventions, this article presents the iterative learning process and impetus that formed the basis of the framework. A developmental evaluation (Patton M. 2010. Developmental Evaluation: Applying Complexity Concepts to Enhance Innovation and Use. New York: Guilford Press.) approach was used to build the framework, as global mental health collaboration occurs in complex or uncertain environments and evolving learning systems.
   Results: A multilevel framework consists of five central components: (1) holistic health, (2) cultural and socioeconomic relevance, (3) partnerships, (4) collaborative action-based education and learning and (5) sustainability. The framework's practical application is illustrated through the presentation of three international case studies and four policy implications. Lessons learned, limitations and future opportunities are also discussed.
   Conclusion: The holistic policy and intervention framework for global mental health reflects an iterative learning process that can be applied and scaled up across different settings through appropriate modifications.

AB  - Sustainable tourism development has attracted attention worldwide. A system-based perspective and an interdisciplinary approach are indispensable for evaluating tourism sustainability. The aim of this study is to propose an emergy analysis framework for the Kanas tourism area in Xinjiang, China, by combining emergy accounting and emergetic ternary diagrams. Data from field surveys and literature analysis were used for the sustainability assessment of the Kanas tourism system. The results show the following: (1) the emergy utilization is not efficient according to the indicators of the social subsystem. (2) The emergy investment ratio, net emergy yield ratio, and emergy exchange ratio of tourism, three indicators belonging to the economic subsystem, indicate that the tourism economy in the study area has low efficiency from different perspectives. (3) The environmental loading ratio of tourism indicates that the environmental pressure on the tourism system is low. However, the values of the emergy yield of waste and the ratio of waste emergy to total renewable resources show that tourism waste adversely affects tourism sustainability due to the growing number of tourists. The results of the emergy sustainability indicator of tourism and the emergy indicator of sustainable development of tourism demonstrate that sustainable development may not be possible in the long run due to the low level of economic and social efficiency, although sustainability was achieved for a certain period. (4) The emergetic ternary diagrams of the indicators visualize the increasing ecological pressure and decreasing sustainability of the system, revealing that Kanas should focus on long-term sustainable development based on the sensitivity lines of renewable resources. Finally, suggestions were provided based on the conclusions.

AB  - The adoption of e-government promises efficiency in the delivery of government services to citizens across various sectors of the economy. Due to this, most Global North countries have advanced in the deployment of e-government for improving public-service delivery. Unfortunately, most African countries, including Ghana, are still lagging in e-government development. This study examined e-government development across African Union member states. It explored the role of e-government in the reform of public administration and governance, focusing on Ghana as a case study. Using a mixed-method approach, the study analyzed secondary data of key e-government indicators using the TOPSIS method. This helped underscore the transformative impact on public administration and governance by using primary data via interviews. The results show advanced progress in some African countries, including Ghana, due to aligned digital strategies with national policies. Also, technology integration is evident in Ghana's public sector and is reshaping public administration and governance. The study recommends that to achieve the long-term sustainability of these advancements, interagency collaboration and data-sharing mechanisms between the public and private sectors should be strengthened, while all forms of silos should be broken to promote the delivery of services. This study enhances public-service delivery by identifying areas needing both improvement and allocation of resources for shaping e-government policy development.

AB  - For construction stakeholders to fully embrace sustainability, its long-term benefits and associated risks need to be identified through holistic approaches. Consensus among key stakeholders is very important to the improvement of the ecological performance of industrialized building systems (IBS), a building construction method gaining momentum in Malaysia. Sustainable construction has become an increasing concern in the Malaysian construction industry nowadays. One of the approach by the Malaysian Government to enhance the ecology or sustainability is through the implementation of IBS in the construction projects. IBS has been introduced in Malaysia since year 1960s and many industries players and academics acknowledge the advantages of IBS. Nevertheless, there have several obstacles faced in order to increase the implementation of IBS and most of the obstacles are rooted from the issues of readiness. To change from conventional or traditional method to a modern method of construction or IBS is not an easy to execute. The key point of the change is a readiness and how to ready for change. Therefore, this highlights the factors which are the key readiness factors to improve sustainable construction through the implementation of IBS. This paper used qualitative approach and interview as a research technique in data collection process. Finding from data interview and literature review, there are three key factors that influence readiness in the implementation of IBS. The key factors are suitability, knowledge and ability. The output can also be used as a guideline for construction players towards the betterment of IBS implementation by introducing the factors that should be emphasized to make sure they ready to implement IBS and get advantages from it.

AB  - Objectives Ensuring that healthcare is patient-centred, safe and harm free is the cornerstone of the NHS. The Scottish Patient Safety Programme (SPSP) is a national initiative to support the provision of safe, high-quality care. SPSP promotes a coordinated approach to quality improvement (QI) in primary care by providing evidence-based methods, such as the Institute for Healthcare Improvement's Breakthrough Series Collaborative methodology. These methods are relatively untested within dentistry. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact to inform the development and implementation of improvement collaboratives as a means for QI in primary care dentistry. Design A multimethod study underpinned by the Theoretical Domains Framework and the Kirkpatrick model. Quantitative data were collected using baseline and follow-up questionnaires, designed to explore beliefs and behaviours towards improving quality in practice. Qualitative data were gathered using interviews with dental team members and practice-based case studies. Results One hundred and eleven dental team members completed the baseline questionnaire. Follow-up questionnaires were returned by 79 team members. Twelve practices, including two case studies, participated in evaluation interviews. Findings identified positive beliefs and increased knowledge and skills towards QI, as well as increased confidence about using QI methodologies in practice. Barriers included time, poor patient and team engagement, communication and leadership. Facilitators included team working, clear roles, strong leadership, training, peer support and visible benefits. Participants' knowledge and skills were identified as an area for improvement. Conclusions Findings demonstrate increased knowledge, skills and confidence in relation to QI methodology and highlight areas for improvement. This is an example of partnership working between the Scottish Government and NHSScotland towards a shared ambition to provide safe care to every patient. More work is required to evaluate the sustainability and transferability of improvement collaboratives as a means for QI in dentistry and wider primary care.

AB  - Agricultural development must integrate multiple objectives at the same time, including food security, income, and environmental sustainability. To help achieve these objectives, development practitioners need to prioritize concrete livelihood practices to promote to rural households. But trade-offs between objectives can lead to dilemmas in selecting practices. In addition, heterogeneity among farming households requires targeting different strategies to different types of households. Existing diversity of household resources and activities, however, may also bear solutions. We explored a new, empirical research method that identifies promising options for multi-objective development by focusing on existing cases of strong multi-dimensional household performance. The "Positive Deviance" approach signifies identifying locally viable livelihood practices from diverse households that achieve stronger performance than comparable households in the same area. These practices are promising for other local households in comparable resource contexts. The approach has been used in other domains, such as child nutrition, but has not yet been fully implemented for agricultural development with a focus on the simultaneous achievement of multiple objectives. To test our adapted version of the Positive Deviance approach, we used a quantitative survey of over 500 rural households in South-Eastern Tanzania. We identified 54 households with outstanding relative performance regarding five key development dimensions (food security, income, nutrition, environmental sustainability, and social equity). We found that, compared to other households with similar resource levels, these "positive deviants" performed strongest for food security, but only slightly better for social equity. We then re-visited a diverse sub-sample for qualitative interviews, and identified 14 uncommon, "deviant" practices that plausibly contributed to the households' superior outcomes. We illustrate how these practices can inform specific recommendations of practices for other local households in comparable resource contexts. The study demonstrates how, with the Positive Deviance approach, empirical observations of individual, outstanding households can inform discussions about locally viable agricultural development solutions in diverse household context.

AB  - Caffeic acid (CA) is a phenolic compound, which has a multifaceted role in the response of plants to various abiotic stresses. Plants must adapt to external stimuli, prompting extensive research into phenolic and flavonoid compounds as potential mitigators of environmental stress impacts. Phenylpropanoids are emphasized for their importance in maintaining plant integrity under stress, while the significance of CA, a cinnamic acid, is interpreted as a key component involved in lignin synthesis and regulating physiological processes. CA deals with different kinds of stress, like salinity-induced stress, chilling stress, and especially drought-induced stress in plants. CA helps plants make certain chemicals called phenolics, which protect them from damage caused by oxidative stress. Researchers are investigating the possible ways that CA functions, including its roles in regulating signals, defending against antioxidants, and preserving the integrity of cells. There is a need to understand the response of CA to abiotic stress factors, which can provide information about its adaptive mechanisms and applications in agriculture. This review proposes genetic advances to increase crop tolerance and provides an overview of the complexities surrounding the role of CA in plant responses to various abiotic conditions. This highlights the need for further research to identify specific mechanisms and interactions with other compounds, as well as the importance of comparative analysis of CA responses in different plant species. It emphasized the importance of meeting the challenges of stress response research and encouraged collaborative efforts for sustainable agriculture and human well-being. This demonstrates CA's importance in enhancing stress resistance and provides a blueprint for future research directions, including the study of specific mechanisms, interactions between components, and applications in the development of stress-resistant products.

AB  - Promoting industrial digitalization and deepening regional collaborative innovation is essential for achieving urban green and sustainable development. This paper constructs a differential game model based on theoretical analysis and reveals the influence mechanism of industrial digitalization and regional collaborative innovation on urban green development efficiency (GDE). After that, this paper uses the entropy method, Super-SBM model, and improved gravity model to measure the level of industrial digitalization, urban GDE, and regional collaborative innovation, respectively. Then, this paper constructs the fixed-effects model, SDM model, moderatingeffects model, and threshold model, then uses the panel data of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) urban agglomeration during 2011-2020 for empirical testing. The results show that: (1) industrial digitalization significantly improves urban GDE. (2) Overall, 2011-2015 is the rapid development period of BTH industry digitalization, and 2015-2020 is its stable development period. However, there are apparent spatial differences and imbalances. (3) Industrial digitalization has a significant spatial spillover effect that can enhance local and surrounding cities' GDE. (4) Regional collaborative innovation can directly enhance urban GDE, and has a positive moderating effect on industrial digitalization to enhance urban GDE. (5) The regional collaborative innovation has two thresholds of 3.9851 and 6.6184. With the collaborative innovation level improving, the main effect intensity steadily increases.

AB  - There is currently a shift from petrochemical to bio-based plastics (bioplastics). The application of comprehensive and appropriately designed LCA studies are imperative to provide clear evidence on the comparative sustainability of bioplastics. This review explores the growing collective of LCA studies that compare the environmental footprints of specific bioplastics against those of petrochemical plastics. 44 relevant studies published between 2011 and 2020 were reviewed to explore important methodological choices regarding impact category selection, inventory completeness (e.g. inclusion of additives), boundary definition (e.g. inclusion of land-use change impacts), representation of biogenic carbon, choice of end-of-life scenarios, type of LCA, and the application of uncertainty analysis. Good practice examples facilitated identification of common gaps and weaknesses in LCA studies applied to benchmark bioplastics against petrochemical plastics. Many studies did not provide a holistic picture of the environmental impacts of bioplastic products, thereby potentially supporting misleading conclusions. For comprehensive evaluation of bioplastic sustainability, we recommend that LCA practitioners: embrace more detailed and transparent reporting of LCI data within plastic LCA studies; adopt a comprehensive impact assessment methodology pertaining to all priority environmental challenges; incorporate multiple plastic use cycles within functional unit definition and system boundaries where plastics can be recycled; include additives in life cycle inventories unless there is clear evidence that they contribute <1% to all impact categories; apply biogenic carbon storage credits only to long-term carbon sinks; account for (indirect) land-use change arising from feedstock cultivation; prospectively consider realistic scenarios of deployment and end-of-life, preferably within a consequential LCA framework.

Moreover, COVID-19 travel anxiety has triggered growing interest in virtual environments (e.g., metaverse travel) in the aftermath of the pandemic. The cost-conscious and tech-savvy behavior of travelers has been resurrected in the 'new normal'; however, the fear of missing out (FOMO) is now dictating travelers' choices for newness, immersive and rewarding travel experiences. To address these emerging trends, promising new technologies, and untested relationships, the present study explored the effects of COVID-19 travel anxiety on the readiness for metaverse space travel. In addition, the moderating influence of tech savviness and travel FOMO was tested on this relationship. Drawing on data of international expats (N = 386) in UAE, the finding based on structural equation modeling (SEM) revealed that the international expat's readiness for metaverse space travel is positively influenced by their COVID-19 travel anxiety. Moreover, expats with high tendencies of travel FOMO and tech savviness will experience a stronger impact of COVID-19 travel anxiety on their readiness for metaverse space travel. These novel findings guided by prominent theories (e.g., self-determination, SOR, and protection motivation) offer new insights for policy makers and practitioners to strategically achieve digital-tourism transformation and sustainability through emerging and immersive metaverse technologies.

AB  - In many countries, but particularly in Portugal, coastal conditions are already endangered by flooding and erosion, both likely to increase as a result of climate change. This daunting prospect raises critical questions of sustainability; social justice; genuine public participation and social learning; effective financing for long term social and economic benefit; connected polycentric governance; and the appropriate use of scientific knowledge bonded to public and political trust. While the development of most shorelines is nominally shaped by public administrative action, rapid coastal migration and excessive economic concentration have turned many threatened coastlines into a stage for settlement hazard and institutional chaos. In Portugal, despite clear evidence of increasing flooding and erosion, appropriate management responses are proving inadequate, both in the turbulent planning framework and in the scarce financial provision for future safeguard. The only plausible alternatives seem to lie in the processes of progressive adaptive governance, involving the trust and full participation of local communities; strongly supported scientific assessments of threat and safety; and fresh approaches to finding suitable funding sources. However, as evident from interviews with key actors in coastal planning in Portugal, the lack of policy clarity and political will, the weak science and poor coordination of stakeholders, combined with the particular regenerating coastal cultures of these communities, make any organised adaptive approaches highly problematic. This consequently places more emphasis on the rich cultural meanings of coastal occupation; of national identity in a time of economic crisis; of social justice in a period of reduced coastal maintenance funding; and of a more measured and sequential approach to an adaptive coastal governance.

AB  - In the past decades, social-ecological systems (SESs) worldwide have undergone dramatic transformations with often detrimental consequences for livelihoods. Although resilience thinking offers promising conceptual frameworks to understand SES transformations, empirical resilience assessments of real-world SESs are still rare because SES complexity requires integrating knowledge, theories, and approaches from different disciplines. Taking up this challenge, we empirically assess the resilience of a South African pastoral SES to drought using various methods from natural and social sciences. In the ecological subsystem, we analyze rangelands' ability to buffer drought effects on forage provision, using soil and vegetation indicators. In the social subsystem, we assess households' and communities' capacities to mitigate drought effects, applying agronomic and institutional indicators and benchmarking against practices and institutions in traditional pastoral SESs. Our results indicate that a decoupling of livelihoods from livestock-generated income was initiated by government interventions in the 1930s. In the post-apartheid phase, minimum-input strategies of herd management were adopted, leading to a recovery of rangeland vegetation due to unintentionally reduced stocking densities. Because current livelihood security is mainly based on external monetary resources (pensions, child grants, and disability grants), household resilience to drought is higher than in historical phases. Our study is one of the first to use a truly multidisciplinary resilience assessment. Conflicting results from partial assessments underline that measuring narrow indicator sets may impede a deeper understanding of SES transformations. The results also imply that the resilience of contemporary, open SESs cannot be explained by an inward-looking approach because essential connections and drivers at other scales have become relevant in the globalized world. Our study thus has helped to identify pitfalls in empirical resilience assessment and to improve the conceptualization of SES dynamics.

AB  - Forest management, especially in regions with diverse socio-economic and environmental challenges, is crucial for promoting sustainable livelihoods. The absence of effective participatory forest management strategies has led to deficits in both forest resource conservation and the enhancement of local livelihoods. This research investigates participatory forest land management by identifying and prioritizing key factors and proposing strategic management approaches. Data were collected through interviews and questionnaires in Qazvin Province, Iran. The data was analyzed using an integrated SWOT-AHP model. The SWOT matrix underscored critical aspects of forest resource management in the study area: "soil conservation and erosion prevention" emerged as a key strength, while "economic stability, improvement and diversity of livelihood of dependent communities" were highlighted as significant opportunities. Conversely, "weak enforcement of laws, policies, and strategies" was identified as a notable weakness and "reduction of forests area" was a concerning threat. The prioritization of SWOT factors revealed that opportunities hold the highest priority. Specifically, "economic stability, improvement, and diversification of livelihoods for dependent communities" and "collaborative forestry" were assigned top priorities, with final weights of 0.1665 and 0.1095, respectively. Furthermore, the AHP method indicated that "program-oriented management with stakeholder participation" is the most crucial strategy, with a relative weight of 0.21. The study underscores this strategy as an effective approach to achieving sustainable forest management, emphasizing its potential to align stakeholder interests and enhance forest conservation efforts.

AB  - As the complexity, breadth of expertise and number of agents involved in megaprojects grow, collaborative innovation models become invaluable for helping to achieve sustainable project development. On this basis, the purpose of this study is to explore the innovation output mechanisms used for collaborative innovation in megaproject (CIMP) systems by the agent-based modelling (ABM) approach, and to promote the efficiency and effectiveness of organisational collaborative innovation through variable controls. A multi-agent simulation CIMP model was developed using the NetLogo tool. The model encompasses the behavioural factors and interaction rules that affect organisational CIMP. Four simulations were conducted, and the results showed that (1) the innovation environment, including policy environment, cultural climate, and engineering demand, has a positive effect on the output rate of CIMP; (2) a larger scale of innovative network organisation accelerates innovation output; (3) innovative organisations must avoid enforcing high standards for cooperation, communication, and recognition abilities when selecting partner organisations; (4) innovative organisations' ability to absorb technology, information, and knowledge is positively related to output, while an increase in behavioural costs reduces the scale of innovative network organisations, thereby affecting their output. This study developed its CIMP theory from the perspective of organisational behaviour. The findings are expected to provide methodological and practical guidance for the selection of innovation agents, behavioural patterns, and for guaranteeing efficient innovation in collaborative megaproject organisations.

AB  - This article is located within current debates on engaged science and learning in higher education, with emphasis on types of learning emerging from engaged sustainability science, and associated contributions to debates on decoloniality in higher education. In particular, the article deliberates how a focus on sustainability science practised as place-based transgressive learning can add to debates on decoloniality in higher education. Through analysis of two case studies, we propose that co-engaged place-based research and learning emerges as a form of multi-loop, transgressive learning that offers possibilities for advancing understanding of decolonising learning processes, at least in those parts of the higher education system where the learning and sustainability sciences meet. This is offered as an approach to deepen science engagement in contemporary African contexts.

AB  - Discovering the determinants of firm sustainable performance from the Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) perspectives is essential. However, few studies have empirically examined all three environmental, finan-cial, and social pillars of sustainable performance into a single research framework in the context of emerging economies like Malaysia. Drawing on the resource-based view and institutional theory, this study identified the determinants of environment, financial, and social sustainable performance of manufacturing SMEs. Data was collected from 209 Malaysian manufacturing firms. A hybrid approach of structural equation modeling (SEM) -artificial neural network (ANN) was used to assess the hypotheses and predict the level of their impor-tance toward sustainable performance. Results showed that green entrepreneurial orientation, green innovation, leadership commitment, stakeholder pressure, and market orientation positively and significantly influenced social performance. Environmental performance was predicted by green entrepreneurial orientation, green inno-vation, leadership commitment, and market orientation. Green entrepreneurial orientation and market orienta-tion demonstrated a positive influence on financial performance. Results of ANN showed that leadership commitment is the most significant factor influencing environmental and social performance while green entre-preneurial orientation is the first ranked factor predicting financial performance. These findings extend the knowledge by shedding light on the determinants of SMEs' sustainable performance. The study enables SMEs to take proper actions in response to sustainability development. Besides, the findings assist practitioners and policymakers in setting effective plans by giving more attention to leadership commitment and green entrepre-neurial orientation as the most significant determinants.Crown Copyright (c) 2022 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of Institution of Chemical Engineers.

AB  - Providing sustainability education to students establishes a lasting foundation of indigenous capability in addressing economic, environmental, and social challenges. Unfortunately, there is a lack of empirical evidence regarding the perception of sustainability among interior design students in India. This study investigates the perceptions of sustainability among students, focusing on a specific Indian university as a case study. The study employed a survey research design, utilizing questionnaires as the primary data collection method, and employed descriptive and inferential statistical techniques to analyze the data. The results indicate that although the students exhibited a strong sense of importance and keen interest in acquiring knowledge about sustainability, most students exhibited limited familiarity with sustainability. Furthermore, the study identified the three most prevalent understandings of sustainability - renewable energy usage, waste reduction, and energy efficiency. In addition, the study findings reveal notable and statistically significant differences between students' understanding of sustainability and their academic level and gender. The study findings can potentially drive collaborative efforts among universities and accreditation agencies to promote sustainability knowledge and transformative practices among future interior designers in India.

AB  - The pursuit of economic growth in developing countries like Tanzania often intensifies environmental degradation, posing significant sustainability challenges. This study examined the interrelationships between globalization, economic growth, and environmental degradation in Tanzania from 1970 to 2022, using World Bank data and the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model. The findings reveal a strong long-run positive relationship between GDP per capita and CO2 emissions, partially supporting the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis. Specifically, the analysis identifies an EKC threshold where emissions peak at 3 metric tons per capita and GDP per capita reaches approximately USD 1200 (TSH 3,120,000), after which further increases in emissions are associated with a decline in GDP per capita. In the short run, GDP per capita shows a weak negative association with CO2 emissions, indicating temporary environmental benefits during growth phases. Foreign direct investment (FDI) exhibits no significant short-term impact on emissions, mostly due to delays in the implementation of mega development projects and changes in the country's economic policies as the result of change in the political regime. Additionally, trade openness is a significant driver of long-run emissions, emphasizing the environmental costs of globalization. To address these challenges, this study recommends that Tanzania attract sustainable FDI for integrating eco-friendly technologies, promote green trade practices by embedding environmental safeguards into trade agreements, and invest in renewable energy infrastructure to decouple growth from emissions. Strengthening environmental regulations, enhancing institutional capacity, and fostering international collaboration are crucial to achieving long-term sustainability. These measures can help Tanzania balance economic development and environmental preservation, aligning with the goals of Tanzania Development Vision 2025 (TDV 2025) and paving the way for a sustainable growth trajectory.

AB  - Digital transformation empowers micro-, small-, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) to rethink the way they make decisions and apply technology in meaningful and sustainable ways. The aim of this study is to investigate the main barriers to MSMEs' sustainable digital transformation, given their global importance and function as the backbone of any economy. We apply the concept of sustainable digital transformation (SDT), which refers to the process of digitalizing the economy in a long-lasting, green, and organic way by building on its key strength: innovative companies and their business ecosystems. The study is based on a representative survey of 425 Latvian MSMEs, which was conducted in the spring of 2021. We combine a survey of MSMEs with a qualitative comparative analysis. Our study identified seven barriers to sustainable digital transformation for MSMEs, which can be classified into three levels of importance. We found that the most important barriers to MSMEs are IT security issues and the shortage of specialists in the external labor market. Furthermore, we discovered that some barriers differ depending on company attributes, such as the number of employees, revenue, and the ability to implement digital transformation independently. However, the barriers were evaluated similarly by company owners and managers. These findings can help MSMEs' managers and owners, policymakers, and practitioners understand which barriers are impeding MSMEs' sustainable digital transformation.

AB  - The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) project is a cornerstone of Ethiopia's economic development and energy security ambitions, and Africa's largest hydroelectric project. It aims to generate significant domestic and export electricity, playing a vital role in Ethiopia's growth strategy. However, this initiative has escalated tensions with downstream nations, particularly Egypt and Sudan, which are concerned about the dam's potential impacts on their water supplies and agricultural systems. The conflict is rooted in deep-seated issues related to water rights and the equitable distribution of the Nile's resources, with Egypt perceiving the GERD as a threat to its historical entitlements established by colonial-era agreements. Efforts to mediate the GERD dispute have involved various regional and international actors, including the African Union, the United States, and the European Union, but have often resulted in limited progress and inconclusive outcomes. Factors contributing to the challenges in mediation include a lack of trust among the involved parties, differing national priorities, and the absence of a comprehensive framework to address the complex interdependencies within the Nile Basin. This paper seeks to analyze the dispute management process surrounding the GERD, exploring the historical context, national interests, and negotiation challenges. By doing so, it aims to provide insights into the dynamics of the conflict and propose recommendations for future mediation efforts that prioritize inclusive dialogue, trust-building, and sustainable water management practices among all stakeholders.

AB  - Purpose - The authors describe the challenges and opportunities associated with developing an interdisciplinary sustainability programme in an emerging economy and illustrate how these are addressed through the approach taken for the development of the first postgraduate programme (MSc and PhD) in sustainability science at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM). The purpose of this paper is to outline an approach that has a potential for application in other parts of Latin America and perhaps more broadly in other world regions sharing some of the same challenges and opportunities as found in Mexico.
   Design/methodology/approach - The implemented collaborative framework enabled a transformation of disciplinary research and teaching at UNAM into a postgraduate programme designed to generate cutting-edge educational and research capabilities. The approach to curriculum and programme design emphasized the process and methodological framework for curriculum development as much as the outcome itself. It entailed three primary elements: theory on collaborative processes; the curriculum design approach; and a formative and summative evaluation.
   Findings - Several of the challenges faced were related to the nature of the institution (mainly because of the complexity of its organization and the emphasis in maintaining disciplinary boundaries), as well as to the curriculum development and design approach (acceptance of a competency-based programme appropriate for the MSc but considered restrictive for the PhD). The experience the authors relate in this paper exemplifies how to cope with such challenges. The approach enabled the emergence of a shared vision that was appropriated by all the participants. This ultimately empowered them in the presentation of the curriculum to their disciplinary peers. Furthermore, the approach facilitated the creation of a programme that remained salient along the process, while increasingly gained legitimacy and credibility among the academic community.
   Social implications - In Mexico, the number of sustainability practitioners and scientists is still insufficient, and there is a clear lack of capacities in key themes and tools. UNAM combines a strong scientific tradition and a foundational mandate to serve both the country and humanity and is, thus, a natural platform for developing a higher education programme in sustainability science. The approach taken in the development of UNAM's programme has useful lessons for the development of similar programmes in other developing nations facing similar educational and institutional challenges.
   Originality/value - This model not only resulted in an innovative and novel programme in sustainability education but also, in the process, strengthened the competencies of diverse stakeholders through a systematic collaborative framework that fosters sustainability as a social learning process. Such experience illustrates the advantages of implementing a collaborative approach to enable the emergence of a critical mass capable to handle the diversity presupposed by a curriculum in sustainability science. It also shows how such a collaborative process can be implemented to overcome the limited resources, lack of experience in sustainability education and strong disciplinary focus that hampers the advancement of higher education in institutions similar to UNAM.

AB  - The establishment of partnerships between universities and communities can significantly support the implementation of initiatives related to sustainability as a whole and help to realize some of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Despite the usefulness of mapping of partnerships, there is a perceived necessity for studies, which may shed some light on these interactions, and the many advantages they offer. Against this background, this paper reports on a study which has assessed the extent to which partnerships between universities and communities may assist in achieving the SDGs. Methodologically, by means of a bibliometric analysis and the use of a set of enlightening case studies, the paper introduces some of the partnerships being implemented today and draws the lessons learned, which may be helpful in future initiatives. A total of eight initiatives are presented and discussed during the paper. The results suggest that more joint efforts are needed, as part of efforts to accelerate the implementation of the SDGs at the university level, including a list of measures that Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) could apply to address those goals. Overall, this research contributes to the sustainability area by providing empirical evidence, insights, and recommendations for fostering partnerships between universities and communities. It adds to the existing body of knowledge and understanding of how collaborative efforts can contribute to sustainable development and the achievement of the SDGs.

AB  - This study provides a comprehensive overview of greenwashing research in business and management, focusing on its conceptual and theoretical foundations. Through a systematic literature review of 97 peer-reviewed articles from Scopus and Web of Science, we use bibliometric analysis to map the evolution of greenwashing studies and network analysis and identify four thematic clusters: (1) symbolic management and CSR communication, (2) environmental regulations and institutional complexity, (3) performance and sustainable practices, and (4) marketing, perception, and trust. Additionally, we perform a full-text analysis to map the theoretical frameworks employed across these clusters, revealing the dominance of macro-level theories (e.g., legitimacy, institutional, and stakeholder theories) and their cross-level interactions with meso- and micro-level approaches. By developing a multi-level theoretical framework, we provide a structured approach to understanding greenwashing across different analytical layers. Then, focusing on the theories used to investigate greenwashing, we identify some avenues for future research. This study has practical implications for understanding how greenwashing affects corporate governance, financial performance, and stakeholder trust, providing insights for enhancing transparency and accountability in sustainable business practices.

AB  - Forest management, especially in regions with diverse socio-economic and environmental challenges, is crucial for promoting sustainable livelihoods. The absence of effective participatory forest management strategies has led to deficits in both forest resource conservation and the enhancement of local livelihoods. This research investigates participatory forest land management by identifying and prioritizing key factors and proposing strategic management approaches. Data were collected through interviews and questionnaires in Qazvin Province, Iran. The data was analyzed using an integrated SWOT-AHP model. The SWOT matrix underscored critical aspects of forest resource management in the study area: "soil conservation and erosion prevention" emerged as a key strength, while "economic stability, improvement and diversity of livelihood of dependent communities" were highlighted as significant opportunities. Conversely, "weak enforcement of laws, policies, and strategies" was identified as a notable weakness and "reduction of forests area" was a concerning threat. The prioritization of SWOT factors revealed that opportunities hold the highest priority. Specifically, "economic stability, improvement, and diversification of livelihoods for dependent communities" and "collaborative forestry" were assigned top priorities, with final weights of 0.1665 and 0.1095, respectively. Furthermore, the AHP method indicated that "program-oriented management with stakeholder participation" is the most crucial strategy, with a relative weight of 0.21. The study underscores this strategy as an effective approach to achieving sustainable forest management, emphasizing its potential to align stakeholder interests and enhance forest conservation efforts.

AB  - Soils participate in the provision of numerous ecosystem services of great importance for the maintenance of ecosystems and human societies. Physical and chemical soils properties sustain supporting ecosystem services like plant production and the infiltration and provision of clean water. Carbon sequestration is a regulating ecosystem service important for climate regulation. Soils are also home of a large biodiversity whose participation in soil processes is critical for their sustainable use. Evaluating these functions to assess the provision of ecosystem services is an important challenge for which simple and accurate tools and methodologies are requested.
   In this work, the relationship of the soil macro-fauna with some soil-based ecosystem services was evaluated in three different regions of Colombia, Brazil and Nicaragua with rather contrasted conditions of soils and management options. In each country, we calculated a set of sub-indicators of physical quality, chemical fertility, organic matter accumulation, soil macro aggregation and macro-invertebrate communities abundance and diversity. The combination of these sub indicators in a General Indicator of Soil Quality (GISQ) provided an overall assessment of the quality of the soil and associated ecosystem services. The strong relationship observed between macrofauna indicators and soil physical, chemical and organic matter characteristics makes it a powerful tool for evaluating and monitoring soil quality.

AB  - Purpose - Healthcare systems are facing persistent challenges, such as dealing with an ageing population, related increases in chronic diseases and healthcare costs facilitated by technological progress. The authors argue that the boundaries of optimisation are being reached and a more fundamental change or transition is necessary. The purpose of this paper is to explore the contours of this transition in the Netherlands. The authors do this from the perspective of healthcare organisations that have participated in the Expedition to Sustainable Healthcare: a learning programme organised by the Dutch Network for Sustainable Healthcare aimed at creating frontrunners in this transition.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper combines conceptual with experimental empirical work. The authors use the transition research frameworks to conceptualise persistent problems and transitional dynamics in the healthcare system. In a longitudinal study, the authors analysed how the participating organisations developed after the expedition.
   Findings - The process validated the initial understanding of persistent sustainability challenges. An integral approach to sustainable healthcare is translated as a transformation of culture, structures and practices and the development of capacity for crossing borders and domains, inside and outside of the organisation. To facilitate and stimulate such a process the authors found that problem structuring and collective identification of persistent problems and the unsustainability in the healthcare system is a crucial step towards a shared view and discourse that supports change.
   Originality/value - A transition in the Dutch healthcare system is just starting to emerge and has barely been subject of research. This paper provides an empirical description of a transition management process in this context. The authors hope to lay a foundation for future work that seeks to explore transitions in healthcare in theory and practice.

AB  - The maximum sustainable yield concept (MSY) and the ecosystem approach to fisheries management (EAFM) have been recently adopted by the European Commission with the objective to achieve, over the long term, the highest possible sustainable yield from a given exploited stock. In this context, a fishing mortality MSY reference level (i.e., F-MSY) should be defined, taking into account recruitment, growth and natural mortality under current or recent ecosystem conditions. Thus, F-MSY is used as a generic term for a robust estimate of a fishing mortality level that is associated with high sustainable yield in the long term, assuming the current harvesting regime in terms of size selectivity. In this study, using the Eastern Baltic cod as an example, we challenge this rather simplified view showing that by using a different harvest selectivity and thus changing the size range of harvested cod, it is possible to largely increase the yield and revenue from the fishery compared to the fishing mortality stipulated in the management plan (i.e., F-MSY), while assuring sustainable high yield in the long term. Thus, implementing the MSY concept in terms of fishing mortality but neglecting selective harvesting effects will not achieve high long term sustainable yield for Eastern Baltic cod. The combination of size selective harvesting and economic reasoning may offer an important tool for the management of marine resources by potentially providing a common currency for the different stakeholders and offer guidance to achieve long term sustainability and human well-being. This would represent the natural step forward in the implementation of EAFM and MSY concepts. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Thematic learning features sustain exploratory activities focused on a selected theme, which contributes to developing students' core competencies, including problem solving, collaboration, and communication skills, supporting sustainable development in learning. For teachers and students, this emerging pedagogical approach may encounter various contradictions in the classroom activity system. Grounded in a cultural-historical activity theory perspective, this study examined the potential contradictions in an activity system in the context of thematic learning, as well as possible strategies for dissolving those potential contradictions and their effectiveness through a case study. Interviews with an experienced teacher were conducted to acquire information about potential contradictions, and the interview results suggested that these contradictions were perceived as potentially occurring between the students, tools, and objects. According to that information, solutions were proposed to dissolve those potential contradictions, including setting moderate learning objects, creating a sustainable exploratory learning environment, scaffolding necessary knowledge, and situating students in an interactive, communicative, and cooperative classroom environment. Finally, the dissolution of those contradictions was examined through classroom observations, with the results showing that students were able to apply their knowledge accurately and fluently to solve the problems. The contribution of this study involves adopting cultural-historical activity theory as guidance to dissolve the contradictions in classroom teaching, which expands the application of this theory compared to previous studies that focused more on the contradictions between researchers and teachers during a lesson study. This innovative application will inspire teachers to adopt this theory routinely to improve teaching, including designing instructional sequences and question chains that support students' sustained exploration.

AB  - IntroductionSituated approaches of rural livelihood diversification, such as community-based agritourism, can localize sustainable food systems at the regional level. This research advances an integrated framework of indicators to assess the interdisciplinary benefits of rural livelihood diversification practices for sustainable local food systems and community resilience. MethodsWe built a framework on four dimensions deducted from secondary data: (1) environmental, (2) sociocultural, (3) economic, and (4) health. These were validated with an inductive analysis of primary data, which we collected from a panel of experts with a content validity index and tested in three rural case studies with shadow observation and qualitative interviews. We conducted both in-depth interviews with community leaders (n = 10) and semi-structured interviews with multi-sectoral stakeholders (n = 40). ResultsFindings (1) identify a comprehensive list of indicators to assess environmental, sociocultural, economic, and health dimensions of rural livelihood diversification practices and (2) advance a participatory approach to prioritize indicators according to their regional relevance (co-developed with stakeholders involved in Bangkok's local food systems). Food tourism connects the four dimensions by (1) preserving local agrobiodiversity (2) preserving rural communities' traditions (3) creating new capacity building opportunities for community-driven socio-economic development and (4) recognizing the health benefits of indigenous foods. DiscussionThis study contributes to a value-added conceptualization of community-based agritourism as a rural livelihood diversification practice. Such research effort highlights the importance of co-producing and ground-truthing indicators for rural livelihood diversification practices localizing sustainable development goals.

AB  - The modem environmental management literature stresses the need for community involvement to identify indicators to monitor progress towards sustainable development and environmental management goals. The purpose of this paper is to assess the impact of participatory processes on sustainability indicator identification and environmental management in three disparate case studies. The first is a process of developing partnerships between First Nations communities, environmental groups, and forestry companies to resolve conflicts over forest management in Western Canada. The second describes a situation in Botswana where local pastoral communities worked with development researchers to reduce desertification. The third case study details an on-going government led process of developing sustainability indicators in Guernsey, UK, that was designed to monitor the environmental, social, and economic impacts of changes in the economy. The comparative assessment between case studies allows us to draw three primary conclusions. (1) The identification and collection of sustainability indicators not only provide valuable databases for making management decisions, but the process of engaging people to select indicators also provides an opportunity for community empowerment that conventional development approaches have failed to provide. (2) Multi-stakeholder processes must formally feed into decision-making forums or they risk being viewed as irrelevant by policy-makers and stakeholders. (3) Since ecological boundaries rarely meet up with political jurisdictions, it is necessary to be flexible when choosing the scale at which monitoring and decision-making occurs. This requires an awareness of major environmental pathways that run through landscapes to understand how seemingly remote areas may be connected in ways that are not immediately apparent.

AB  - The significance of accurate energy production prediction cannot be overstated, especially in the context of achieving carbon neutrality and balancing traditional and clean energy sources. Unlike conventional models with simplified assumptions or limited data inputs hindering energy usage optimization, waste reduction and efficient resource allocation, we introduced a novel structural equation modelling approach to eight manufacturing industries' sustainable waste management practices (SWMPs) in Iraq. This comprehensive analysis, conducted with Smart PLS software on 375 responses aims to enhance energy production predictions' accuracy and support sustainability goals contribute to achieving carbon neutrality goals and promote a balanced energy mix that supports sustainability and environmental stewardship. The findings reveal noteworthy insights: notably, chemical manufacturing companies exhibit a substantial advantage from green accounting practices, witnessing a 78.1 % and 45.8 % improvement in environmental auditing oversight and SWMPs, respectively, compared to other manufacturing sectors. Compared to conventional grey models, our model demonstrates that a 1-unit improvement in CSR enhances environmental auditing oversight effectiveness by 33.4 % and sustainable waste management by 56.9 % across industries. By leveraging these data-driven insights and innovative approaches, we can drive positive change towards a more sustainable and resilient energy future, collectively contributing to a more resilient, efficient, and sustainable energy ecosystem that benefits societies, economies, and the environment. The heightened accuracy of energy production prediction facilitated by our novel model empowers stakeholders at regional and global levels to make informed decisions, mitigate risks, support policy development, achieve sustainability goals, formulate effective policies and foster collaboration.

AB  - It is imperative to offer equal quality learning opportunities for young children at both deprived and advantaged early childhood development centres (ECDCs). To this end, substantive involvement by young children in the envisioned quality learning that should take place, even in constrained contexts, warrants thoughtful exploration. Consequently, this study investigated the development of young children's communication and mathematical skills to explore the affordances of the South African National Curriculum Framework for children from birth to 4 years in relation to incorporating science concepts. Our proposition for privileging science concepts relevant to early learning and development areas of the curriculum framework was premised on the urge to respond to young children's current learning needs in order to make learning in the future sustainable. We adopted a participatory action research design, undergirded by principles of intra-relationality, to develop an assessment and activity plan consistent with our proposition. Using the principles of free attitude interviews and brainstorming as techniques, rich qualitative data were generated during meetings, workshops, and reflection sessions with study team member participants. The team made the following observations and findings: the transition of young children from ECD to Grade R is marred by challenges that make the learning of young children beyond ECD unsustainable because of the absence of continual communication between the ECD and Grade R teachers and, to some extent, between the parents (home) and the ECDC. Through the knowledge gained from regular participatory action-oriented meetings, workshops, and reflections, the study contributed to the development of participants and benefited the ECDC involved in this study in several respects.

AB  - The integration of sustainable practices within the fashion supply chain has been one of the areas receiving increased attention due to global competition and stricter regulations. The concept of Sustainable Supply Chain Management (SSCM) ensures that eco-friendly practices have been adopted by many global fashion brands. Fashion industries in developing countries such as Vietnam, one of the leading fashion manufacturing countries in South-East Asia, are under tremendous pressure to comply with sustainability norms. Therefore, this paper aims to review the recent trends in SSCM in Vietnam's fashion and retail industries. A four-step approach was adopted: collection of information through literature or data collection (Step 1), classification and codification (step 2), input of industry experts (Step 3) and analysis of the above three inputs (Step 4). The findings showed that although Vietnam is among the top five exporting countries of textiles and garments globally, the concept of a sustainable supply chain is new to many of the Vietnamese supply chain players. Four out of five stakeholders claimed that they are attempting to achieve sustainability by reducing environmental pollution, taking care of the labor force, and pursuing future sustainable materials as well as renewable energy resources. In addition, one of the stakeholders, the retailers, regularly focus on ethical practices in their sustainable sourcing. These practices help Vietnam to concurrently diminish its environmental impact and ensuing negative consequences as well as improve the country's social and economic sustainability.

AB  - (1) Background: A charity thrift store commonly takes on employees with disabilities, but such a business model creates many challenges to overcome, as will be described. This research focuses on the satisfaction of such individuals taking service-learning courses. (2) Methods: The five management functions are planning, organization, leadership, coordination, and control. Service-learning students learn management theory to apply in practice. To test the quality of their learning, a reliability analysis, descriptive statistics, and T-test were carried out using the questionnaire survey method. (3) Results: First, there is a need for education, training, and process improvements for internal staff. Then, efforts must be made to improve customers' perception of the charity thrift store, e.g., via beautification. Beyond that, institutional promotion may be an option, as are social media posting suggestions. Finally, real serving experience enables those in training to engage in critical self-reflection. The results of the questionnaire survey show that the students most satisfied with the service-learning training are those seeking to work in social care, rather than retail, but that all service-learning students were at least somewhat satisfied with the training provided. Significant differences were observed in service-learning satisfaction related to the students' gender and identity. (4) Conclusions: Students' self-reflections can enhance their self-growth and problem-solving skills. Additionally, this management course awakens respect among the students for those with disabilities. After their satisfaction is reviewed, college students are willing to continue to participate in the service-learning. This course offers sustainable results by supplying a steady stream of trained workers to charity thrift stores.

AB  - Climate adaptation planning is said to be a necessary and inevitable facet of future societies, and is rapidly occurring across a range of geopolitical scales. Previous scholarship suggests that a democratic decentralized approach, one that fosters inclusive participation and representation, is central to achieving equitable and sustainable outcomes of adaptation. However, recent studies frequently characterize the adaptation process as dominated by a techoscientific approach, among expert and elite actors, that tends to obscure or neglect the perceptions and desires of more marginalized members of society. This paper employs a values-based approach to better understand motivational factors for a closed and non-inclusive adaptation process. Through a case study of early, yet formidable stages of adaptation planning in the urban, coastal region of Hampton Roads, Virginia, empirical data among the epistemic community were gathered by interviews and participant observation at de facto adaptation planning forums. Research results document an exclusionary process favoring the participation and representation of technocratic elites and the exclusion of elected officials and local citizens. When linking these case study findings to value theory, inferences are made that adaptation planning in Hampton Roads is motivated by dominant institutional actor values of power and security, those that are theorized to be in opposition to values fostering social and environmental justice. In light of these research results, this paper calls for a critically reflexive adaptation practice, thereby challenging values, assumptions, and beliefs of the self, as well as social structures and power relations that shape adaptation planning.

AB  - Contribution: An analysis of the extent to which sustainability is present in the syllabi, project briefs, report templates, and student final reports of the three Iberian European project semester (EPS) providers, over a five-year period. Background: EPS is a one-semester capstone project framework that adopts project-based learning and multicultural, multidisciplinary teamwork. Educating engineers for sustainable development requires fostering critical and ethical thinking and a desire for equity, solidarity and preservation of natural resources, and cultural and genetic diversity. Existing engineering capstone design programs emphasize solving real world problems, hands-on training, and soft skills, but few focus on sustainability aspects of engineering design. The three Iberian EPS providers adopt project-based learning and teamwork methodologies, promoting the development of transversal skills and addressing sustainability in a multicultural and multidisciplinary background. Intended Outcomes: To show that the three Iberian EPS providers follow these recommendations and contribute to raising students' awareness of sustainable development. Application Design: The proposed sustainability learning assessment method collects evidence from syllabi, project briefs, report templates, and final reports to extract faculty and student perspectives. The sustainability-related terms collected were processed into word cloud format, allowing a simple and intuitive interpretation of students' understanding of sustainability, and in co-occurrence network format, to understand if sustainability has a pervasive or confined presence within the reports. Findings: Iberian EPS faculty and students are aware of the social, economic, and environmental impact of their projects, in terms of quality of life, social responsibility, the use of resources, and environmentally friendly technology.

AB  - While the textual attributes of corporate financial documents, such as annual reports, have been extensively analyzed in the academic literature, those of corporate sustainability reports, which serve as a critical channel for nonfinancial disclosure, are relatively under-explored. Given the increasing importance of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors in corporate strategy and stakeholder evaluation, understanding the role of textual attributes in sustainability reporting is crucial. This study examines 10,021 hand-collected sustainability reports from Chinese firms between 2009 and 2021, focusing on six key textual attributes: length, readability, tone, boilerplate language, redundancy, and completeness. Using computational linguistics, we analyze how these attributes evolve over time and their impact on ESG ratings provided by both international (MSCI, FTSE) and domestic (SNSI) agencies. Our findings reveal that the length and completeness of sustainability reports significantly influence ESG scores across agencies, demonstrating a shared appreciation for detailed and transparent disclosures. However, international and domestic rating agencies exhibit differing responses to attributes like tone, boilerplate language, and redundancy. These differences highlight variations in evaluation standards, methodologies, and value orientations between global and local stakeholders. The results emphasize the need for firms to tailor their sustainability disclosures to meet diverse stakeholder expectations. This study contributes to the growing body of literature on nonfinancial reporting by providing empirical evidence on how specific textual characteristics of sustainability reports can shape ESG evaluations, offering insights for both corporate communicators and policymakers.

AB  - This paper presents a unique sustainability analysis of one of the first attempts to establish a biodiesel industry in Mexico. From 2008, several companies established medium to large-sized Jatropha curcas plantations in Yucatan, hiring local peasants to carry out the agricultural work. After five years, the plantations were abandoned due to poor seed yields and a lack of key knowledge for large-scale cultivation. Based on a multidisciplinary approach, we performed a three-dimensional sustainability evaluation of the potential biodiesel production chain, which included household interviews, a socioeconomic survey, and a life-cycle assessment (LCA). We identified both negative and positive effects in the three dimensions analyzed. Socially and culturally, the local peasant families understood sustainability as their ability to preserve their traditional lifestyle, and associated environmental services with their sense of identity. They therefore considered the jatropha plantations to be positive for sustainability, since they brought income, even though some perceived damage to the natural resources of the surrounding areas. Economically, peasants' annual household income increased by approximately $1080 USD due to the increased salaries paid by the jatropha companies. The LCA predicted large savings of greenhouse gas emissions (>50% compared to fossil diesel), but also potential negative impacts in some categories (human/ecological toxicity and eutrophication potentials) associated with the use of mineral fertilizers, insecticides, and pesticides applied during the cultivation stage. Biodiesel production would be potentially energetically self-sufficient, in addition to producing a 40% energy surplus. Finally, even though the sustainability indicators suggested a positive overall assessment, the reality was that the jatropha projects failed because they were predicated on unrealistically optimistic projections and poor agronomic knowledge of the plant.

AB  - Achieving equitable and sustainable ecotourism requires a wide range of multidisciplinary and cross-scale information, particularly given the growing scale of ecotourism operations and continuing governance and climate challenges. Ecosystems in Mexico's Gulf of California and Baja California Peninsula support a thriving ecotourism industry that has quickly expanded over the last few decades, potentially outpacing research into current performance and future sustainable development opportunities. We develop and apply a formal literature review approach to characterize academic marine ecotourism literature, highlight key insights and identify research strengths and gaps, and thus analyse almost 50 publications for the region from 1994 to 2014. There has been a significant increase in the number of various types of publications; most (68%) focus on ecological themes, 25% on economics, and 7% on social aspects of human wellbeing. There are also trends towards research on specific species (e.g. mammals, fish and sharks) and in specific areas. A common theme in publication conclusions is the need for collaboration from all stakeholder groups. We discuss these findings, and address potential limitations of our method, with a view to informing sound policies to ensure that ecotourism can provide equitable benefits to local communities while incentivizing sustainable practices and nature conservation.

AB  - Understanding participatory processes and identifying successful implementation methods is key to effective bottom-up sustainable forest management strategies. This paper aims to contribute to that understanding by systematically reviewing the literature dealing with participatory methods to forest management in five European Mediterranean countries (France, Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain), specifically identifying the relationship between the level of stakeholder involvement, type of stakeholders and the methods applied, as well as the results obtained, and the main challenges identified. Our findings show that stakeholders commonly involved are NGOs, landowners, companies, and local government bodies. A strong correspondence between the methods used and the purpose and level of stakeholders' involvement is identified. Social benefits stand out as the most relevant result of this engagement somehow overshadowing economic and environmental ones. Results show that participatory forest management methods are simple and do not depend on sophisticated methods and techniques, so that their wider application depends above all on the will to do so.

AB  - Non-technical summary Tourism significantly boosts a nation's economic growth, but unrestrained practices can cause serious environmental damage. As an essential part of the tourism industry, hotels meet the fundamental needs of tourists. This study examines the sustainable environmental management practices of hotels in Malaysia. It finds that hotels prioritize cost-saving and short-term benefits over long-term environmental gains. The study also reveals variations in sustainable practices based on hotel location and star rating. These insights are useful for various stakeholders in developing strategies and initiatives to achieve sustainable development goals.Technical summary Sustainable environmental management practices (SEMP) are essential to pave the way toward achieving a net-zero emission sustainable future. This study explores the level of SEMP among hotels in Malaysia based on distinct categorizations of location and star ranking. The findings show that hotels in Malaysia adopt higher basic SEMPs but less advanced practices. However, the level of basic and advanced SEMPs in hotels differ according to their geographical locations and star ranking. The findings also suggest that hotels in Malaysia prioritize cost-saving practices and short-term benefits over the long-term benefits of sustainable practices. The study contributes to the existing literature by highlighting the variations in the sustainable practices among different categories of hotels. Further, the findings are helpful for practitioners and policymakers in designing tools and measures, and promoting initiatives that best suit different types of hotels. Such efforts are crucial to promote and accelerate the engagement of sustainability practices in hotels.

AB  - Existing scholarship on agroecology and food systems education within U.S. colleges and universities has focused primarily on preparing students to be professionals working in agrifood systems. Developing students' skills and competencies, though vitally important, may not suffice for supporting transformative learning. Transformative learning shifts students' perceptions and awareness and informs future actions, constituting a potential avenue for leveraging education to support transformations toward more socially just and ecologically viable agrifood systems. It is unclear, however, what pedagogies and educational practices enable transformative learning. This paper explores the integration of multiple pedagogical innovations within an advanced agroecology course taught at the University of Vermont. Over a decade, the teaching team has made iterative adjustments to course content and pedagogies with the goal of catalyzing action toward transforming agrifood systems. In this paper, we evaluate our pedagogical approach, asking: (1) How well do course content and pedagogy align with our definition of transformative agroecology as transdisciplinary, participatory, action-oriented, and political? (2) How well does our approach enable transformative agroecological learning, and how is that identified? We present our course evaluation as a case study comprising qualitative analyses of course syllabi, student comments on University-administered course evaluations, and most significant change (MSC) reflections. MSC reflections proved to be a valuable method for identifying and assessing transformative learning. Through a curricular review, we found that substantial changes to course content and evaluative assignments between 2010 and 2020 align with a transformative approach to agroecology. This is validated in students' MSC reflections, which provide evidence of transformative learning. In sharing evaluative results, processes, and insights, we aim to contribute to a broader movement of scholar educators committed to iteratively and collaboratively developing transformative pedagogies within agroecology and sustainable food system education. We contend that reflexive practice among educators is necessary to leverage education for transforming agrifood systems.

AB  - The most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports conclude that for Australasia, without adaptation, further changes in climate, atmospheric CO2, sea-level rise and ocean acidity are projected to have substantial impacts on climate sensitive systems, sectors and populations. In the context of varying geographical, social, cultural and policy contexts, this paper reviews research contributions and activities concerning coastal adaptation to climate change in Aotearoa-New Zealand. It reflects on the insights derived from this emerging pool of scholarship and considers what lessons have been learned to help us address the future challenges of adaptation to climate change on our coasts and estuaries. In particular, future progress will require strong understanding of natural coastal systems, clearer national direction and guidance in balance with regional flexibility, and collaborative processes to help communities understand, implement and evaluate adaptation pathways for a sustainable and resilient future.

AB  - Climate adaptation research increasingly focuses on the socio-cultural dimensions of change. In this context, narrative research is often seen as a qualitative social science method used to frame adaptation communication. However, this perspective neglects an important insight provided by narrative theory as applied in the cognitive sciences and other practical fields: human cognition is organized around specific narrative structures. In adaptation, this means that how we 'story' the environment determines how we understand and practice adaptation, how risks are defined, who is authorized as actors in the change debate, and the range of policy options considered. Furthermore, relating an experience through story-telling is already doing 'knowledge work', or learning. In taking narrative beyond its use as an extractive social research methodology, we argue that narrative research offers an innovative, holistic approach to a better understanding of socio-ecological systems and the improved, participatory design of local adaptation policies. Beyond producing data on local knowledge(s) and socio-cultural and affective-emotive factors influencing adaptive capacity, it can significantly inform public engagement, deliberation and learning strategies-features of systemic adaptive governance. We critically discuss narrative as both a self-reflective methodology and as a paradigmatic shift in future adaptation research and practice. We explore the narrative approach as a basis for participatory learning in the governance of socio-ecological systems. Finally, we assemble arguments for investing in alternative governance approaches consistent with a shift to a 'narrative paradigm'. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - A more holistic perspective concerning benefits of farms to society was envisioned for research and education relevant to current Science Frontiers of the American Society of Agronomy (ASA). A transformative approach in which interdisciplinary research contributed to productive and sustainable agricultural systems in the world was proposed. Career experiences of the author revealed both challenges and opportunities inherent to holistic approaches involving the contrasting worldviews represented among multiple research disciplines and diverse stakeholders. The objectives were (1) develop a learning system that accommodated diverse disciplinary knowledge and human values and affect in the context of agroecosystems and (2) relate a model of systemic learning to research and education relevant to the ASA Science Frontiers. The author's holistic perspective of learning emerged during a shift from purposive learning, which emphasized goal-oriented research and education focused on systems in the world, to purposeful and critical learning about learning itself. Models of systemic learning were developed to represent relationships among learner experiences and worldviews, affective phenomena, cognition, and action. Metalearning about systemic learning itself, including relationships of culture, ethics, and politics to worldviews of stakeholders, contributed to the transformative nature of the systemic learning models. Critical evaluations of the systemic learning models provided a seminal example of an epistemology for integrating human values, norms, and affective phenomena during research and education relevant to ASA Science Frontiers.

AB  - PurposeThe mining industry plays a critical role in the global economy by providing raw materials and metals for various sectors, but it is also associated with environmental and social impacts. This paper presents a comparison of the findings from social life cycle assessment (S-LCA) with those obtained from a stakeholders' risk perception analysis. The goal is to provide a multifaceted view on the challenges faced by the mining industry in achieving sustainable practices.MethodsThis research reports the results of S-LCA and stakeholders' risk perception analysis used to evaluate the social dimension of sustainability in two different European Horizon 2020 projects: (i) recovery of secondary metals and minerals from mining residues through bioleaching and chemical precipitation (project NEMO with a demonstration site in Finland), and (ii) recycling of wastewater and valorization of tailings from mining activities to create geopolymers through chemical activation (project ITERAMS with a demonstration site in Portugal).ResultsThe S-LCA conducted in NEMO reveals that fair salary is the social category presenting the highest risk (22% of the total). This risk is unequally shared between foreground activities (4%) and background activities (18%), and it occurs mostly in Finland. The S-LCA in ITERAMS shows that the low percentage of employees organized in trade unions accounts for the highest social risk (14%), occurring mostly with the background activities (8.5% out of the 14%). The risk perception analysis conducted among involved stakeholders for both projects highlighted that the analysis performed using only S-LCA databases overestimated some social issues (e.g., access to biomass, trade unionism) that were not relevant for local stakeholders while underestimating, or even ignoring, other social issues that are considered important by the same stakeholders (e.g., health and safety, housing prices).ConclusionsThe two case studies show the critical need to integrate locally gathered data from stakeholders directly involved in the projects with the broader insights offered by sector-level S-LCA. Local analysis can capture site-specific dynamics and social risk perceptions, while S-LCA can extend the analysis to the entire supply chain. Both analyses highlighted that one of the main limitations of the current S-LCA framework is the omission of the positive environmental, social and economic effects resulting from the proposed projects. Ultimately, these case studies provided valuable insights for the stakeholders involved in both projects, facilitating information sharing concerning the primary social risks associated with the development and implementation of the technologies proposed by the projects. This empowers decision-makers with the information required to formulate strategies that can enhance the sustainability of the bioleaching and geopolymer technologies used to valorize mining residues.

AB  - Stakeholder and public participation in natural resources management (NRM) is now widely accepted as necessary to achieve sustainable development outcomes. Yet, effective implementation of participatory processes necessitates well-calibrated methods and tools, as well as carefully honed facilitation skills that are difficult to gain without practice. Practitioners and academics leading these processes are thus encouraged to better reflect on, prepare, and justify their interventions, before starting to work in the field with stakeholders. Our paper shows how a Simulation Community of Practice (SCoP) was set up to support improved participatory practice. The specificity of this community is that its members not only discuss planned participatory interventions, but also simulate these processes by adopting roles of future participants, and by working through the different steps of the workshop that will be later implemented in the field. The evaluation of our approach shows that individual and social learning of participants in the SCoP is developed, leading mainly to improved facilitator skills and to calibration of the participatory methods and tools being tested. A space is also provided for deepening reflection on the purposes of the participatory process and the values that guide these interventions. Our experience could provide a model for others around the world to set up their own SCoP to support participatory NRM practice. Further improvements to our SCoP and new ones could be made by enhancing the feedback mechanisms between the field sites and the community, in order to encourage more cumulative learning and to reinforce the members' interest, maintaining their involvement in the community over time.

AB  - To reap the benefits of sustainability in the construction sector, it is crucial that the stakeholders involved can implement it in practice. Investigations have shown that choices made in the early phases of the building process are of very great importance for the outcome and the initiatives and decisions taken by the building owner are crucial.
   This paper presents research on Danish building practitioners' ability to make requirements for sustainability in procurement. On the basis of an action research strategy, we asked practitioners to help identify the challenges involved in requiring sustainable solutions through procurement. These included among others a lack of knowledge or experience in sustainable procurement and interdisciplinary challenges. The research showed that practitioners are able to formulate specific requirements for sustainability in procurement. However the challenges found imply that a sustainable approach in procurement is not fully implemented in a Danish context. This suggests that there is a need for guidance in the area, if the practitioners are to move from good intentions to making more specific requirements for sustainability in procurement.

AB  - Corporate accountability has expanded rapidly in recent years as a tool that business can employ to respond for corporate performance. Nevertheless, the exercise of corporate accountability is challenging as it requires stronger corporate capacity and commitment to respond to external stakeholders in alignment with voluntary regulatory norms. In response, corporate agendas are being significantly shaped by internal and external stakeholders that are employees, suppliers, and customers. Yet, an examination of the current status of accountability both as a historical trend and in current corporate agendas in selected cases shows an increasing gap between policy and impact. Based on a case study method and theory building, the research reported in this article shows the status of corporate accountability of companies operating in Asia-Pacific and adhered to the Global Compact Network. It also provides some conceptual and practical tools toward enhanced accountability, contributing to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goal 17 (SDG 17) and its targets Multi-stakeholder partnerships (17.16 and 17.17) and Data, monitoring, and accountability.

AB  - This article presents an in-depth case study on cross-sectoral collaborative business model development (CBMD) that is pressured to produce systemic sustainability transformations. Drawing on paradox theory, we identify three paradoxical tensions-value, creativity, and consumer tensions. While engaging these tensions offers synergy and creativity potential, engagement barriers limit stakeholders' ability to harness this potential. Stakeholder networks can access synergy potential by engaging meso-level tensions through increased trust and collaboration. Yet, macro-level engagement barriers posed by governments and society lead to a reliance on incumbent patterns and reduce creativity. This research advocates for reconsidering CBMD processes and regulatory frameworks to enable engagement with these paradoxical tensions. Our implications offer insights for industries transitioning from centralized models to more individualized, decentralized approaches. The findings underscore the necessity of promoting reciprocal interactions and engagement across different levels and the early integration and strategic orchestration of stakeholders to cultivate trust and align objectives.

AB  - Construction is a manufacturing industry that consumes substantial amounts of natural resources, human resources, and social capital. Activities that occur during building construction and utilization negatively impact the environment and have direct and indirect impacts on the surrounding community and society. Properly assessing the sustainability of buildings is critical to the pursuit and achievement of sustainable development goals. Also, construction project decision-makers and stakeholders currently lack an effective tool for comparing the relative sustainability of different materials, design approaches, construction methods, and building operation alternatives. Thus, an integrated framework for assessing building sustainability in terms of environmental, economic, and social aspects is developed and proposed in this paper based on life cycle thinking. This framework is applicable to different building types and life-cycle assessment scopes and provides a practical tool for construction investment project stakeholders to reference, implement, and use to guide the decision-making process. This framework may also provide a reference for other researchers in the construction field to develop sustainability assessment models optimized for different types of construction projects.

AB  - In this paper, a comprehensive energy management framework for microgrids that incorporates price-based demand response programs (DRPs) and leverages an advanced optimization method-Greedy Rat Swarm Optimizer (GRSO) is proposed. The primary objective is to minimize the generation cost and environmental impact of microgrid systems by effectively scheduling distributed energy resources (DERs), including renewable energy sources (RES) such as solar and wind, alongside fossil-fuel-based generators. Four distinct demand response models-exponential, hyperbolic, logarithmic, and critical peak pricing (CPP)-are developed, each reflecting a different price elasticity of demand. These models are integrated with a flexible elasticity matrix to assess the dynamic consumer response to fluctuating electricity prices. The study evaluates four operational scenarios, focusing on grid participation, DER utilization, and the impact of real-time pricing (RTP), time of use (TOU), and critical peak pricing strategies. Quantitative results demonstrate the significant cost-saving potential of integrating DRPs with microgrid operations. In the optimal scenario, the GRSO achieved a minimum generation cost of 882 & YEN; for the base load profile. Further, when critical peak pricing (CPP) was applied, the generation cost was reduced to 746 & YEN;, representing a 15.4% reduction. For a scenario where the grid's participation was limited, the logarithmic-based demand response model decreased the generation cost to 817 & YEN;, while full grid interaction led to higher cost reductions. Additionally, our results show a significant reduction in peak load, with load factor improvements of up to 87.7% across the studied demand profiles. Furthermore, limiting the grid's upstream power capacity to 30 kW resulted in a 7% increase in generation cost across all cases, confirming the importance of grid participation in reducing operational costs. The GRSO algorithm outperformed traditional metaheuristics in terms of both execution time and convergence, making it a viable solution for real-time microgrid optimization. In conclusion, the proposed GRSO-based framework provides an efficient approach for microgrid cost minimization, achieving up to a 15.4% reduction in operational costs and notable environmental benefits by reducing emissions. This study highlights the importance of dynamic demand response strategies and grid participation for sustainable and cost-effective microgrid management.

AB  - Asymmetric information distribution from sellers to buyers in the residential property market disadvantages buyers, as buyers may not have complete information particularly related to sustainability features (that contribute to occupant health, safety and amenity, over time), which could potentially reduce operational costs associated with the property. Property practitioners including real estate agents, property valuers and mortgage brokers who have direct connection with buyers could possibly help to bridge this information gap. Through 28 semi-structured interviews, this study examines the perspectives of Australian property practitioners regarding the challenges they face in collecting information and strategies for distributing the information. The results show that the main concerns of property practitioners are the lack of data on the economic benefits of sustainability features and the lack of resources with which to gather such information. A framework that includes collaboration between government, supply chain agents, property practitioners, third-party real estate data collectors, researchers, and buyers, is proposed, for better information gathering and distribution. This could potentially reduce asymmetric information, particularly as related to sustainability features for potential buyers and hence enhance market efficiency. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Community-based ecotourism (CBET) has become a popular strategy to alleviate the contradiction between ecological protection and community development. As the stakeholders of CBET, the community's participation in the planning process is of great importance to in order to realize the sustainability of CBET. Taking a community in Wolong Nature Reserve as a case study, in this study we developed a decision-making participation mechanism based on the participatory scenario method. Through this mechanism, community stakeholders can effectively reach consensus with other stakeholders on the planning of CBET in the future. The results showed that community participation in the planning process can mean decisions are more likely to reflect their interests. They unanimously proposed that future CBET must adhere to the basic principle of protecting biodiversity and must maximize the welfare of the community. Moreover, achieving the sustainability of CBET in protected areas requires the cooperation of all stakeholders.

AB  - This paper provides a critique of the performative assumptions of the teacher professional learning policy direction being adopted in Australia. Through international policy borrowing, the policy direction in Australia is similar to many other countries in that it encourages increasingly standardised teaching practice to afford a more quantitative approach to evaluation. The intent through this paper is to encourage greater imagination with regards to what counts as useful in teacher professional learning. This is achieved initially through highlighting the evidence of teacher learning within the Australian Sustainable Schools Initiative (AuSSI), a programme that makes use of collaborative professional inquiry around authentic problems. The social theory concepts of cross-field effects and linked ecologies are then deployed in an analysis of the emerging national policy framework for teacher professional learning in Australia, arguing that this policy framework can suppress the types of learning occurring in approaches such as the AuSSI.

AB  - Purpose - This chapter presents a framework for an action research based intervention to develop and transform sustainable healthcare in a regional context. The framework is illustrated by the case of the Regional Cancer Centre (RCC) West in western Sweden.
   Design/methodology/approach - The framework draws upon and develops Pettigrew's context - content - process model of strategic change and applies it to the unfolding narrative of the change effort. The empirical focus is the activities of a learning platform consisting of the RCC leadership, senior cancer physicians designated as process owners and an action research team. Data were collected from documents, observations of the learning platform, notes from meetings and interviews. Outcome data were obtained via the self-reporting of the physicians.
   Findings - The learning platform established the capability for wide ranging development and quality improvement on the 23 cancer pathways as well as some support activities around principles of patient-centred care. A clear result is greater inter-organisational collaboration between care professionals as well as the introduction of new medicines, clinical methods, joint learning activities and new forms of measurement and monitoring of care practices. All of the improved measures are sustained.
   Originality/value - Whilst there is no shortage of rhetoric on patient-centred care, the reality is that in complex healthcare systems solutions such as process-oriented approaches often fail. This case presents a model and an approach that eschews clear visions for change and instead places an emphasis on dialogue, participation, professional autonomy and collaborative communities as means for achieving the patient-centred ideal. The case also shows the value of seeing sustainable health systems as being grounded on practitioner - scholar collaboration that combines practical knowing with scientific knowledge.

AB  - The energy sector is the largest emitter of greenhouse gas emissions, accounting for 37% of the world's combined emissions, and plays a key role in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. However, there is no systematic means for planners and practitioners to integrate climate considerations throughout the lifecycle of energy infrastructure projects. Using a thematic document analysis, we provide a comprehensive list of activities related to climate mitigation and adaptation which can be systematically mainstreamed into the energy sector project lifecycle to support a range of sustainable development outcomes. Two renewable energy projects were used to integrate the results into a practical context and demonstrate the range of potential SDG target synergies. The case studies demonstrate the varied means by which climate action can be integrated through mainstreaming in project lifecycle stages, holistically achieving wider SDG impacts. This work provides a practical means to maximise progress within the framework of climate-compatible development.

AB  - Management education holds promise for addressing deficiencies in interuniversity science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), as well as sustainability curricula. Accordingly, we designed, developed, implemented, and longitudinally evaluated interdisciplinary STEM-based curricula in the United States. Students in five sections of business management courses and two sections of STEM courses received a STEM-based sustainability intervention (i.e., an interdisciplinary STEM and sustainability module). To assess student outcomes following the intervention and examine the feasibility of cognitive mapping as a student learning assessment tool, we implemented a pre- and post-course modified cognitive mapping assessment in treatment and comparison courses. To interpret the results, we ran descriptives, correlations, paired sample t tests, and principal component analysis. The t tests suggest that when all coding categories are considered, those participating in curricular interventions listed significantly more sustainability terms. The principal component analysis results demonstrate that treatment courses improved variability explained by 7.23% between pre- and post-tests but declined by 8.22% for comparison courses. Overall, linkages became stronger between parent code categories for treatment courses and weaker for comparison courses. These findings add to existing research related to cognitive mapping and demonstrate the ability of the method to capture changes in student outcomes after exposure to STEM-based sustainability curriculum.

AB  - Community-based forest management (CBFM) is the principal strategy in managing inhabited 'forest land' in the Philippines. It involves the participation of local communities in various forestry activities to achieve sustainable forestry, advance social justice and improve socioeconomic welfare, and promote a stable and healthy environment. This paper analyses the potential benefits of agroforestry farms in CBFM sites to mitigate climate change. The incorporation of trees in farms and landscapes has led to enhanced carbon storage and sequestration. Half a million hectares of agroforestry farms in CBFM sites in the Philippines are estimated to store 25 MtC while sequestering 2.7 MtC annually. Lessons are drawn from three carbon sequestration projects under development using CBFM as the main approach. Income from carbon credits is not sufficient to recover the cost of tree planting. The transaction costs of forestry CDM projects are substantial and could prove to be the greatest barrier to project fruition. Government institutions must find ways to encourage project developers by simplifying rules and regulations for forestry carbon projects. Forest definition must be assessed. Project developers and the government could also explore the voluntary carbon market which is more flexible than the CDM market. Policy and technical studies must be conducted to ascertain the potential of the REDD for CBFM sites in the country.

AB  - Conditions and pathways for transforming ocean conflicts require an understanding of the wide range of perspectives and values from all relevant stakeholders. In such cases, participatory assessment of conflicts can lead to knowledge co-production and collective learning. In this approach, the different views and the relevance assigned to conflicts are described by the involved stakeholders. In this paper, we aim to present a participatory assessment of conflicts involving small-scale fishing communities of Sao Paulo coastline, southeastern Brazil from the perspective of the multiple actors involved with the marine-coastal ecosystems of the region. The conflicts were assessed through an online survey and virtual participatory workshops. The survey was used to assess the conflicts related to the fishing activities in the territory. Participatory workshops were carried out to validate and complement the conflict assessment by the online survey and to establish a ranking of the most important conflicts by different stakeholders. A total of 132 conflicts were systematized into 12 categories, and the most relevant were as follows: legislation and surveillance, large-scale enterprises in coastal areas, pollution, fishing regulation, and fisheries management and planning. We argue that a collaborative identification of conflicts has the potential to refine and validate different interpretations and to foster social learning among the stakeholders that is essential to promote sustainability in the territory. This participatory process seeks to increase the social legitimacy for future marine spatial planning processes and to contribute with a novel process of coproducing transformative knowledge action.

AB  - Community gardening has become a growing movement in cities all over the world, where these diverse collectively managed spaces provide various economic, ecological, and social benefits for urban residents. Particularly in developed countries such as Germany, social benefits are the motivation to participate in community gardens more so than the harvests. Although research on community gardens has grown, including the question of their benefits to a sustainable development, there is little literature studying the social importance and social sustainability of community gardens. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to examine social interaction, participation, and perceived success as a concept to assess social sustainability. The paper further aims to examine the conditions influencing social sustainability within community gardens. With the help of an online survey, we collect data from 123 community gardens throughout Germany, with which we assess diverse degrees of social sustainability. Causalities of gardens' social sustainability are analyzed with a multiple linear regression model. Results indicate that there is no significant relationship between size of community and social sustainability, rather aspects of trust and management have a strong effect on social sustainability. Findings like these lead to a better understanding of social interaction in urban communities that contribute to more social sustainability.

AB  - Increasingly, bike share programs (BSP) are being introduced on college campuses across the United States as a means ofpromotingsustainable mobility. However, many of these programs face challenges that threaten their sustainability. Using a case study approach, this paper discusses the operation, participation, successes, and challenges facing a relatively new campus bike share program in Southeastern US. The study employed a descriptive research design and utilized quantitative methods to generate insights. With the aid of questionnaire, data was collected from multiple stakeholders including private cyclists, registered bike share members, and transportation service staff on college campus. SPSS was used to analyze the data, with descriptive statistics such as frequencies and percentages, and inferential statistics including the chi-square test. The results indicate that the program has shown a modest patronage in ridership, but several challenges were identified. They include inadequate bike paths, limited bike parking spaces, and safety concerns. The paper concludes with a discussion of policy implications of the findings.

AB  - Background The burden of hypertension in many low-and middle-income countries is alarming and requires effective evidence-based preventative strategies that is carefully appraised and accepted by key stakeholders to ensure successful implementation and sustainability. We assessed nurses' perceptions of a recently completed Task Shifting Strategy for Hypertension control (TASSH) trial in Ghana, and facilitators and challenges to TASSH implementation. Methods Focus group sessions and in-depth interviews were conducted with 27 community health nurses from participating health centers and district hospitals involved in the TASSH trial implemented in the Ashanti Region, Ghana, West Africa from 2012 to 2017. TASSH evaluated the comparative effectiveness of the WHO-PEN program versus provision of health insurance for blood pressure reduction in hypertensive adults. Qualitative data were analyzed using open and axial coding techniques with emerging themes mapped onto the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). Results Three themes emerged following deductive analysis using CFIR, including: (1) Patient health goal setting- relative priority and positive feedback from nurses, which motivated patients to make healthy behavior changes as a result of their health being a priority; (2) Leadership engagement (i.e., medical directors) which influenced the extent to which nurses were able to successfully implement TASSH in their various facilities, with most directors being very supportive; and (3) Availability of resources making it possible to implement the TASSH protocol, with limited space and personnel time to carry out TASSH duties, limited blood pressure (BP) monitoring equipment, and transportation, listed as barriers to effective implementation. Conclusion Assessing stakeholders' perception of the TASSH implementation process guided by CFIR is crucial as it provides a platform for the nurses to thoroughly evaluate the task shifting program, while considering the local context in which the program is implemented. The feedback from the nurses informed barriers and facilitators to implementation of TASSH within the current healthcare system, and suggested system level changes needed prior to scale-up of TASSH to other regions in Ghana with potential for long-term sustainment of the task shifting intervention.

AB  - In this paper, we discuss how transdisciplinary development research (TDR), if approached in particular ways, can produce new knowledge and also foster deeper systemic changes in the knowledge system itself. We are concerned with systemic change that supports propoor sustainability transformations, and conceptualize the processes that contribute to this type of systemic change as "transformative space making" (TSM). Transdisciplinary development research as TSM can generate possibilities for the integration of diverse knowledges into decision making, while also creating new opportunities for subaltern knowledges to achieve greater influence, through enhancing the transformative agency of the poor. Thus, our conceptualization goes beyond the idea of TDR for the cocreation of solution-oriented knowledge and recognizes the need to address structural injustices in knowledge systems. In TDR as TSM, the development of strategies to reveal power relations and navigate the politics of structural injustices becomes as important as refining the principles for robust collaborative knowledge production. To demonstrate the operationalization of TDR as TSM, we draw insights from our long-term involvement in TDR case studies of emergent environmental and health challenges in periurban contexts in India. We identify mechanisms that build legitimacy of propoor knowledges, while simultaneously creating "readiness" to take advantage of opportunities for interventions to support change in policy and practice at multiple scales. We highlight the politics of alliance building both within and beyond the research team, arguing that attention to alliances is central to understanding the role of TDR in creating possibilities for transformative change. Finally, we argue that development research funding and commissioning agencies should pay attention to the mechanisms of TSM, alongside more recognized aspects of the planning, monitoring, and evaluation of TDR initiatives, in order to provide appropriate support for enhanced impact.

AB  - Sustainable consumption is crucial for mitigating global sustainability challenges. Understanding consumer behaviors and motivations, particularly in developing regions, is essential for designing effective interventions. This study pioneers an innovative methodology integrating participatory visual methods (photovoice) and artificial intelligence analysis to investigate food waste perceptions in an emerging economy context. Twenty-six university students participated in the study, documenting their lived experiences and perspectives on household food waste through photographs and narratives. The key results included 32% of participants expressing shock at the extent of food waste in their daily lives, while 28% showed relative indifference. AI-powered (Artificial Intelligence) computer vision and natural language processing were used to efficiently analyze the large visual and textual dataset. The mixed methods approach generated nuanced, situated insights into consumer attitudes, behaviors, and socio-cultural drivers of wastage. The key themes included low waste consciousness, aesthetic and convenience motivations, social norms, and infrastructural limitations. The participatory process proved effective for raising critical consciousness and uncovering consumption practice dynamics. AI analysis enabled rapid knowledge discovery from the qualitative data while mitigating researcher bias. This innovative integration of participatory methodologies and computational analytics advances sustainable consumption research by empowering marginalized voices and generating contextual insights from unstructured data. With further development, such human-centered AI approaches can transform the study and governance of sustainable consumption.

AB  - Increasing awareness on achieving the targets of sustainable development goals led to the various discussions on sustainability in manufacturing applications. Sustainable manufacturing has been considered as one of the key factors for achieving sustainable consumption and production. Considering the advantages, sustainable manufacturing has been discussed with various perspectives in order to improve the sustainable manufacturing performances. This study considers one of the perspectives where other studies are limited within the context of sustainable manufacturing performances, multi-stakeholder perspectives. The sustainable manufacturing performances has been collected and evaluated with multi criteria decision making methodology, best worst method. The three multi stakeholder perspectives have been considered for this study which includes manufacturer perspective, customer perspective and government perspective. The collected sustainable manufacturing performances were evaluated based on these different multi-stakeholder perspectives, in order to understand the similarities and differences among multiple stakeholders in the implementation of sustainable manufacturing through its performances. The detailed discussion of obtained results was explored and acknowledged with existing literature support along with the response from case industrial managers. The similarities and differences of opinion among different stakeholders has been explored to provide fruitful contributions to both academic and scientific community. The key managerial implication of this study is that assisting the industrial managers to focus on influential sustainable manufacturing performances instead of focussing less influential ones based on the opinions of different stakeholders.

AB  - Recently, sustainable supply chain management has attracted the attention of scholars and practitioners. Data envelopment analysis (DEA) is a useful tool for evaluating sustainability of suppliers. Ranking a system of voting is an important topic in DEA. Many firms apply voting systems to rank candidates. Generally, these kinds of methods rank candidates by their associated weights. In this paper, to increase discrimination power among candidates, a novel model for obtaining a suitable value of discriminating factor is proposed. Then, using the optimal value of the discriminating factor, a new model for calculating preference scores of candidates is presented. This model evaluates candidates based on different set of weights. To evaluate candidates based on common set of weights, using concept of ideal point, two new multiple objective programming models are proposed. The proposed method is applied for selecting the most sustainable suppliers that supply self-supporting cable for a power distribution company. Results show that candidates might be affected by changing the set of weights. Using our proposed models, full rankings are obtained.

KW  - BENEFITS
AB  - The Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) regulates the ecolabeling of products from fisheries with the aim of promoting sustainable fishery practices. To date 11 fisheries have attained full certification and a further 7 are under review. Together these fisheries offer 220 ecolabeled marine products to consumers. Despite great potential to encourage sustainable fisheries, and thereby bring conservation benefits to marine systems, a range of issues may limit the wider uptake of MSC ecolabeled products. These include a general lack of consumer concern for marine fishes and sustainable fisheries, an absence of guaranteed continued financial benefits to participating fishers, and difficulties of quality assurance that are related to complexities of monitoring compliance of marine fisheries. In addition, it is apparent that property rights over the fishery seem to be an essential prerequisite for engagement in MSC, and this is one major impediment to wider uptake of the scheme in current marine fisheries, which tend to be open access. Some modifications to the current scheme may be needed if wider participation of marine fishers is to be achieved. These may include a tiered approach to certification, certification of fishers rather than fisheries, governmental facilitation to assist the latter, and greater engagement with retailers and buyers rather than individual consumers. None of these changes will occur without constructive engagement of government, retailers, and the fishing industry.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the contextual factors contributing to the sustainability of healthcare quality improvement (QI) initiatives.
   Design/methodology/approach - Themes from semi-structured interviews with international healthcare leaders are compared with Kaplan and Provost et al.'s (2012) model for understanding success in quality (MUSIQ). Critical success factors within these themes are shown in detail.
   Findings - The interviews provide a rich source of information on critical success factors. The themes largely correspond with MUSIQ, reinforcing its robustness. An important factor emerging from the interviews was the importance of engagement with patients and families in QI, and this needs consideration in seeking to understand context in QI.
   Research limitations/implications - Interview participants represent a limited set of western countries and health systems. Their experiences may not hold true in other settings. Practical implications - The detail on critical success factors provides QI practitioners with guidance on designing and implementing sustainable initiatives.
   Originality/value - Including consideration of contextual factors for engagement with patients and families in frameworks for context in QI appears to be an original idea that will add value to such frameworks. Researchers in patient engagement are starting to address contextual factors and connections should be made with this work.

AB  - SDG 17 calls for the international community to "strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development," emphasizing the role of multi-stakeholder partnerships for achieving the SDGs. Policy documents are replete with statements on the necessity of 'meaningful' engagement, especially with civil society-without clarifying what 'meaningful' stands for. In this article, we develop an analytical approach to partnership as a form and norm of metagovernance. Partnership as a metanorm is about the roles and relations of different sets of actors. We suggest operationalizing the concept of partnership according to different levels of accountability and participation, allowing for a gradual enhancement of the quality of partnership in terms of 'meaningfulness.' We apply our analytical model to the Global Action Plan for Healthy Lives and Well-Being for All (GAP), a fairly new initiative by health and development agencies to accelerate progress towards the health-related targets of the 2030 Agenda. By investigating the development and the early phase of implementing the GAP, we empirically assess if and how the notion of partnership envisioned in the GAP qualifies as 'meaningful' with respect to civil society engagement. From our empirical example, we infer lessons for attaining normative standards of 'meaningfulness' and highlight implications for future research on partnerships.

AB  - The space and energy sector have similar sustainable ambitions and face similar technological difficulties, providing numerous occasions for learning, collaborating and creating economic and societal value. Adopting space technology and applications within the energy sector offers many high-potential opportunities worth exploring. Space can serve as an enabler for revolutionizing the energy sector by providing information on renewable energy sources and energy efficiency to facilitate the energy transition and support decision and policy-makers in developing, implementing, and monitoring various energy policy areas such as energy resource management and energy transport. Political interest in this topic is rising, and multiple high-level discussions took place in Europe in 2018 to gain a deeper understanding of the opportunities and enablers for space as a tool to support European energy policy. This article draws on the insights from two dedicated events to highlight the most prominent opportunities and enablers. The outcomes of these events provide a source of inspiration for policy development, investment decisions, and R&D proposals to further stimulate space as an enabler for sustainable economic growth in the energy sector.

AB  - In the present research paper, we argue that digital transformation and students' behavioural trends are intertwined through the increasing integration of digital technology tools into both academic and personal communication contexts. We construct our argument through a rigorous methodological approach employing quantitative and qualitative analyses, including ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis, chi-squared, and multiple regression models, to assess the main predictors of digital communication satisfaction and engagement. Hence, we emphasise distinctly the diverse roles of digital communication platforms as relating to the expression of students' engagement and adaptability, beyond mere technological adoption. While investigating the role of behavioural economics in modelling students' engagement with digital technologies, we examine the impact of digitalisation on students' communication patterns, both in terms of personal and academic purposes. To measure student engagement, we employ a mixed-methods approach by carrying out a pilot study (N = 167). The findings underline the role of digital transformation in enhancing students' access to learning, communication, and collaboration tools, while they also align with Sustainable Development Goal 4 (Quality Education). Our intention is to develop a more comprehensive model that integrates behavioural insights with technology acceptance theories, while another further direction could be exploring longitudinal data to assess the long-term impacts of digital tools on student engagement and learning outcomes.

AB  - Stakeholder theory, originally introduced in 1984 by philosopher Edward Freeman, is among the most influential theories today addressing the complex interplay of societal actors. It underwent several transformations and expansions, but the original Freeman model as well as the latest approaches places the corporation at the center positioning the theory as management driven. In this article-from a sustainability science perspective-we argue that sustainability could also be considered as the center, around which societal actors are grouped, because everyone, individuals as well as stakeholders, have a stake in a 'common future' that is built on the transformative concept of sustainability. Next to this shift of perspective from corporation to sustainability at the center, we advance the concept of sustainability stakeholders with the new paradigm of the digital age we (are about to) live in: the proposed sustainability-centered stakeholder theory is developed to incorporate novel parameters as brought about by digitalization (such as big data, real-time transparency, algorithmic correlations, predictive analytics, or changing privacy standards). Hence, we classify the stakeholders of sustainability according to their roles as "big data stakeholders:" collectors, generators, and utilizers of big data. This digital sustainability stakeholder model operationalizes the complex interplay between stakeholders focused on their 'stake' in sustainability and a common future and illustrates their roles in the digital age. Thus, it offers a normative framework to analyze stakeholders' responsibility to contribute to, advance, promote, and achieve sustainability.

AB  - The global Coronavirus or COVID-19 pandemic exposed the weakness of healthcare systems including laboratory systems and is a call to action for unprecedented collaboration and partnerships to deal with the global crisis. The United States (U.S.) President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) establishes the global HIV/AIDS treatment agenda in alignment with the UNAIDS 90-90-90 treatment targets to achieve epidemic control related to enhanced testing, treatment, and viral suppression. A strategic PEPFAR priority area recognizes that large-scale collective efforts and sharing of resources bear greater potential impact for lasting change than any single organization or entity can achieve alone. An important vehicle utilized within the global public health context is the public-private partnership (PPP) model whereby multiple international organizations forge unified project charters to collectively reach mutually agreed goals. While touted as an ideal mechanism to synthesize resources and maximize gain in numerous applications, little is known from a seasoned stakeholder perspective regarding PPP implementation and sustainability issues. The purpose of this research is to holistically examine perceptions of PPP model sustainability related to inputs and impacts among a collective network of stakeholders experienced with PEPFAR workforce development, laboratory-system strengthening project implementation. Interviews were conducted with frontline stakeholders from public and private sector organizations based in the US and select PEPFAR-supported priority countries. Analysis revealed three dominant themes: PPP impacts, keys of successful collaboration, and logistical challenges and opportunities to enhance sustainability of PPP outcomes in the future.

AB  - The increased cost of labor in modern viticulture stemming from the nature of operations that require physical strength and precision, coupled with labor shortages, poses a significant constraint in facilitating and scheduling seasonal activities. Therefore, autonomous collaborative robots present a potential solution for achieving sustainable development objectives and decreasing operational expenditures in agricultural operations. The current paper presents an economic assessment of collaborative robots (or cobots for short) in comparison to conventional labor for four different cultivars in Greece in a lifecycle costing methodological framework. The selected cultivars are Asyrtiko, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Tempranillo, which are cultivated by two private wineries in the area of interest. All the relevant expenses of their annual production were distributed to agricultural operations, and eight scenarios were developed to compare conventional and cobot practices. The results indicate the great potential of cobots regarding specific viticultural operations such as weed control, pruning, herbiciding and topping. The adoption of cobots in these operations has the potential to contribute to sustainable agriculture by reducing labor costs and addressing labor shortages, while also increasing the efficiency and precision of these tasks. Nevertheless, the defoliation and tying operations appeared to be inefficient in most cases in comparison to conventional labor practices. Overall, the annual equivalent costs could be reduced by up to 11.53% using cobots, even though the projected lifetime of the cobots plays a significant role in the cost-effectiveness of autonomous robotic labor in viticulture. In conclusion, cobots could be instrumental in the Greek viticulture, integrating innovation and high-quality products toward sustainable agricultural development.

AB  - Research commissioned by the Scottish Government in 2022 investigated Learning for Sustainability (LfS) as it is experienced through the Scottish Curriculum for Excellence (CfE) by young people (14+ years), practitioners in secondary schools (teachers), and in community learning and development (CLD) settings. The research sought to identify best practice in LfS, its challenges, and successes since the implementation of the Scotland's Learning for Sustainability Action Plan. The research included a questionnaire for practitioners, exploring their awareness of and engagement with LfS; along with a series of World Caf & eacute; events/Three Horizons focus groups with young people and practitioners. This paper situates the findings and analyses them in an international context and through the lens of critical and transformational theories of education for sustainability to provide further insight into LfS in Scotland in light of the policy and legislative backdrop for teaching and learning in this field. It contends that despite Scotland being a world leader in policy and curriculum integration regarding learning for sustainability, there are considerable gaps in what is promoted in policy and what occurs in schools and communities, in effect, denying young people the transformational educational opportunities needed to become effective agents of change.

AB  - The significant role of corporate social responsibility (CSR) in achieving sustainability and in meeting the expectations of stakeholders has been well documented. Using a collection of 2173 publications on CSR and its connections with business performance, this study conducted a bibliometric investigation using the Systematic Literature Network Analysis (SLNA) technique combined with network visualizations to demonstrate the current research trends, most topical themes and the developing areas of interest in the growing field of CSR and its linkages with business performance for an approximate period from 2004 to 2023 as published in the Scopus database of two decades. The goal was to explore the research gaps by analyzing the most cited authors and most impactful publications by year, location, subject area and document type. The study also outlined the trends by topic prevalence, commonly used keywords and citation networks based on co-occurrence and co-authorship to identify the current thematic gaps. The results reveal a mild rate of growth in scholarly interest around the field of CSR and business performance until 2022, where a manifold increase in publications was recorded. An expanding focus on human, social and organizational behavior, economic systems, financial and social performance, leadership, stakeholder management and management science was identified, although there is a scarcity of studies around issues regarding developing countries, climate change, CSR disclosure and small businesses. These findings demonstrate the current state of the research and offer interesting insights and timely research directions as a roadmap for future studies.

AB  - The problem of forest degradation and loss has become the concern of many countries. To address this challenge, some collaborate in sustainable forest management. The most successful outcomes, however, are observed where local participation is an essential part of conservation efforts. In Ghana, forests have experienced various degrees of exploitation over the years, resulting in their ecological decline. Despite its designation as a protected area for biodiversity and ecosystem services, the Atewa Range Forest Reserve in Ghana has been significantly impacted by deforestation, illegal mining, and other destructive activities. The purpose of this paper is to examine ecologically based management approaches that could be adopted to generate beneficial outcomes for all forest stakeholders and actors in Ghana. The study sampled forest stakeholders in Kwabeng, the administrative capital of the Atewa West District, to understand forest governance challenges and outline strategies for overcoming them. The study revealed that a bottom-up all-inclusive approach to managing forest resources is necessary. This paper, therefore, proposes an integrated forest governance that prioritizes the UN Sustainable Development Goal 15-Life on Land-related to forest preservation.

AB  - This study undertook an examination of livelihood security in West Bengal, a predominantly agriculture-based region situated in eastern India. Our investigation centred around the Sustainable Agriculture Livelihood Security Index (SALSI), which integrates four fundamental dimensions: ecological security index (ESI), economic efficiency index (EEI), infrastructure sufficiency index (ISI) and social equity index (SEI), and represented a total of 36 diverse indicators associated with these SALSI. We employed the "non-dimensionalization" approach to quantify the aforementioned dimensions. Principal component analysis was then employed to discern the pivotal indicators associated with each component of the SALSI. The study unveiled notable inter-district spatial variations in the four facets of the SALSI. Notably, Paschim Medinipur achieved the highest SALSI score at 0.60, while Jalpaiguri recorded the lowest at 0.35. Among the sub-components, ESI emerged as the strongest with a score of 0.57, surpassing EEI (0.52), ISI (0.36) and SEI (0.46). Remarkably, Purulia, Jalpaiguri and Uttar Dinajpur districts exhibited a notably limited level of sustainability in their agriculture-based livelihoods. In contrast, North 24 Parganas, Birbhum, Uttar Dinajpur, Purba Medinipur, Paschim Medinipur and Bardhaman demonstrated a high degree of sustainability in their agricultural livelihoods. These findings offer valuable insights to inform policymakers and relevant stakeholders, facilitating the transformation of districts with low sustainability levels into regions with moderate and high agricultural sustainability through the formulation and implementation of appropriate policies. The methodology presented in this study can be effectively applied across varying scales in other regions within India and in similar contexts in other developing nations.

AB  - As traditional cultural heritage education gradually reduces students' exposure to the physical environment, it is more difficult to stimulate students' awareness of and interest in local culture. The concepts of cultural preservation and sustainable development have not yet been effectively integrated into teaching. Therefore, this study developed an alternative reality game (ARG) combined with a learning scaffold to enable students to gain a deeper understanding of the history and cultural heritage of Taiwan during the Japanese rule period through an immersive learning experience and to explore and solve real-world problems in an interactive environment, which helped students understand the concepts of cultural preservation and sustainable development. The results of the study showed that the experimental group of students using the ARG integrated learning scaffold significantly outperformed the control group in terms of learning effectiveness and engagement. Students in the experimental group not only had a deeper understanding of the curriculum content but also showed higher behavioral and emotional engagement. In addition, students' awareness of cultural preservation and sustainable development increased, which indicates that the materials developed in this study are effective in promoting their deeper understanding of local educational development and cultural identity. This study confirms that the combination of innovative technology and gamified instruction not only enhances students' learning effectiveness but also promotes their understanding of cultural heritage. Future research should further optimize the use of technology to reduce the impact of operational difficulties on students' learning experience and explore how alternative reality game (ARG) technology can be used in more subject areas.

AB  - The key to achieving an effective and sustainable geopark waste management system is fostering community participation. This research about the Gunung Sewu Geopark, Yogyakarta, Indonesia, examines the phases and levels of community participation in waste reduction. The study involved surveying 1,757 respondents aged 18 and above using door-to-door questionnaires, which were analysed using the conditional probability method to determine participation stages and levels. The results indicate that community participation in waste reduction activities, such as composting and recycling is inadequate, with only 21.12% of respondents participating in the decision-making stage, 1.99% participating in the implementation stage, and 0.68% finding waste reduction activities valuable. Rural community participation level scores were 0.68 and categorised as very low. The incomplete stages of participation and low levels of participation are significant challenges for implementing sustainable waste management and maintaining conservation principles in Gunung Sewu Geopark. Further research could be conducted to determine the driving factors that most influence rural community participation so that geopark policymakers can develop strategies to increase participation more effectively and to targets.

AB  - Participation has been touted as a critical instrument for both citizen empowerment and responsibility-sharing in sustainability. In architecture, participation allows for the progression of green building to sustainable habitation that integrates environmental, economic, and social dimensions. However, participation in practice rarely delegates meaningful decisions to marginalized groups and is mostly a one-sided process. This study seeks to investigate which factors of the participatory method afford both empowerment and behavioral change to a sustainable lifestyle in low-income groups. To do so, a case study of designing a social housing estate in Hungary is presented, where participatory design was used to codevelop a building that considers and adjusts to the sustainable lifestyle envisioned by the future residents. A coding engine based on the concept of pattern languages was developed that places conditions and experience of everyday activities at the center of design, translating them to spatial features. As a result, a focus group of social housing tenants and cohousing experts were able to define explicit shared spaces, allocate square meters to them, and articulate legible design criteria. Of the early-stage design decisions, 45% were made with or by the participants, and the bilateral process made it possible to convince the tenants to adopt a more sustainable habitation format.

AB  - INCOM Egypt has undergone automation in some processes where critical aspects of its operations are transformed and automated. This paper presents an overview of INCOM Egypt processes using Ould Riva and analyses the process of 'handling a product'. It aims to demonstrate effective automation of the production of wires and cables process accompanied to Industry 4.0 while considering environmental and economic sustainability goals that were inhibited by COVID-19 restrictions. Ould's Riva method is used to analyse the production process of wires and cables to propose improvements for automating the process. Business process modelling is utilised to study the processes for clearer understating. The flow of information within the process is also analysed to integrate the production process with other processes and supply chains, which helps to identify which production activities can be automated and mainstreamed into the information flow to achieve environmental and economic sustainability. The context of INCOM Egypt, as a case study, is presented along with the Riva model of its operations. The paper identifies the before, i.e., As-Is process, and after, i.e., To-Be Process, automation of the 'handle a product' process using the Role Activity Diagram (RAD). The process involved redesigning and improving different activities to increase resource-use efficiency to participate in achieving the goals of sustainability. The focus of this paper is to investigate the negative impact of COVID-19 on sustainability and to examine the accomplishments of process automation of wire production towards environmental and economic sustainability. The results of the research reveal a relationship between business process modelling and sustainability. Moreover, automation of processes (Industry 4.0) is found to reduce the negative effect of COVID-19 on production. A triangulation between process modelling, process automation (Industry 4.0), and sustainability was determined. Each one is reinforcing and impacting one another. The RAD model demonstrates that automation of the activities in the process reduces waste, time, cost, and redundant processes as factors of sustainability, which may also help to lessen the unfavorable effects of the pandemic. The results proved generalisation on other organisations in the same line of business.

AB  - Envisioning trajectories towards sustainability encompasses enacting significant changes in multiple spheres (i.e., infrastructure, policy, practices, behaviors). These changes unfold within the intricate landscapes of wicked problems, where diverse perspectives and potential solutions intersect and often clash. Advancing more equitable and sustainable trajectories demands recognition of and collaboration with diverse voices to uncover meaningful synergies among groups striving to catalyze substantial change. Projects of this nature necessitate the exploration of varied tools and methodologies to elicit, convey, and integrate ideas effectively. Creating spaces for reflexivity is essential for catalyzing more meaningful impact as individuals engage in discussions aimed at sharing and questioning the coherence of their projects while forging synergies, identifying common objectives, and planning long-term outcomes. We present the initial phase of an endeavor in which we developed a software that elicits causal networks based on mapping relations between projects' actions and outcomes. To illustrate our approach, we describe the results of using this software within collaborative workshops with groups spearheading projects initiated by a government entity in Mexico City. By adapting elements of the Theory of Change model, this software transcends the dominant linear project logic by guiding participants in designing causation networks that unveil how different projects can articulate to identify potential common elements and find new possibilities for coordination among initiatives. We discuss the potential of such software application as a dynamic tool to guide and promote reflection and coherence when crafting projects that aim to more meaningfully address sustainability problems.

AB  - Mangroves are a unique ecosystem that provides various benefits to people. In Thailand, Mangrove Action Project (MAP) has introduced Community-Based Ecological Mangrove Restoration (CBEMR), a novel technique to restore degraded mangroves. Unlike conventional tree planting, CBEMR does not require a planting phase. It emphasizes preproject assessments of mangrove ecology and hydrology to facilitate natural regeneration. Therefore, this study aims to (1) investigate the perception of stakeholders on the value of mangroves; (2) examine the understanding of stakeholders on conventional mangrove planting and CBEMR as mangrove restoration techniques; (3) understand the challenges and motivations of the CBEMR efforts in the Andaman Coast of Southern Thailand. We use Q Methodology, a semi-quantitative method that requires participants to rank a set of statements to analyze their perceptions according to the research questions. As a result, we can identify three clusters of perceptions; D1 demands more CBEMR and less conventional planting. D2 believes mangrove planting is good, given suitable conditions. D3 thinks restoring mangroves brings benefits, but most conventional planting often fails. This study highlighted that all CBEMR stakeholders believe inadequate technical knowledge is the root cause of mismatch restoration practices. Mangrove planting should be done with suitable species, conditions, and areas. Conventional planting of mangroves without considering ecological factors and local engagement should be avoided as it fails to achieve sustainable outcomes. Enhancing knowledge of mangrove ecology and restoration techniques is therefore a sustainable route to the long-term success of mangrove restoration in Thailand.

AB  - This multiple disciplinary research attempts to theoretically develop a stakeholder harm index to capture and catalogue psychological, social and work related health aspects of harm of high performance work practices (HPWPs) on stakeholders (employees, their families and the community) from the negative externality perspective. An understanding of the harm of HPWPs will facilitate the role of sustainable HRM in improving the ethics of care for the stakeholders while achieving organizational financial performance. The usefulness of the stakeholder harm index in capturing the harm of an HPWP is illustrated using a review of the critical HRM literature on work intensification. Results from the literature review reveal that the stakeholder harm index provides an important framework for capturing the comprehensive harm and the associated social costs of work intensification based on welfare loss for the stakeholders. Empirical and practical implications to capture the harm and the associated social costs of harm are discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper explores hybrid organisational forms that have emerged in response to institutional complexity. For this purpose, the paper studies organisational practices to explore hybrid characteristics in municipally owned corporations (MOCs) and differentiate between distinct manifestations of hybridity. Using a case study research design, three MOCs are selected as units of analysis, and 30 semi-structured interviews are conducted to explain why and how organisations emerge as hybrid organisations through the adoption of multiple institutional prescriptions that compete with their existing logic. The findings of the study reveal a practical approach to managing complexity where organisations tend to form different hybrids rather than simply accepting or rejecting institutional pressures. The study offers insights into the outcomes within organisational milieus as they navigate and assimilate these competing pressures, underscoring that the resultant ramifications may not invariably align with initial expectations.Points for practitionersProviding municipally owned corporations (MOCs) a clear framework that outlines their tasks, responsibilities, and expected results can prevent conflicts arising from differing institutional logics, ensuring that MOCs operate in alignment with the government's objectives.Hybrid organisations must cultivate a culture that emphasises adaptation and flexibility to gradually integrate the competing logic that improves system performance and sustainability.While introducing reforms, practitioners should invest in capacity-building efforts for public organisations. Training and support initiatives are imperative to equip organisations with the skills needed to adapt, integrate conflicting pressures, and effectively cope with the demands of evolving institutional environments.

AB  - Construction projects have faced serious schedule delays caused by rework risks. However, it appears that traditional methods are of limited value in developing applicable project schedules. This study presents an analysis on construction projects schedule development under rework scenarios by a novel method named the improved critical chain design structure matrix (CCDSM). Research data are collected from a real estate development project in China. As a result, predictions of project completion duration and probability have been made. A reliable schedule considering information interactions has been developed and visualized. Rework impact areas of activities have been examined to quantitatively record the impact on project duration. To meet different demands, the method generates two more schedules setting different rework buffers. Furthermore, these activities have the potential of causing rework and have been quantified based on the calculation of two criticalities, providing an identification of rework-intensive works that should be payed close importance to, which have not be realized by previous methods. The results proved the feasibility and effectiveness of this method in developing a schedule for construction projects disturbed by rework, helping practitioners adopt measures to avoid rework-caused schedule delays and achieve sustainable development of such projects.

AB  - The current global food system is under threat due to significant global changes such as rapid urbanization, climate change, COVID-19 outbreak, etc. The importance of food system sustainability as a key element of sustainable cities has been gradually recognized in recent years; however, the tools for estimating food system sustainability in cities (i.e., urban food system sustainability) holistically are still scarce. Thus, this study represents a comprehensive investigation into food system studies and their impacts on achieving a sustainable community or city. This study is a subset of larger studies that aim to develop an urban food system framework, which utilizes modern approaches in framework development such as sustainability food indicators and a participatory approach. However, to achieve this, trends, gaps, and challenges of the current approach to food system studies need to be reviewed and discussed. A systematic analysis utilizing the protocol of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) approach was conducted, and network analysis of publications was performed via VOS viewer. The results suggest applying circular principles and merging smartness and resilience thinking in developing strategies for food system sustainability. This study finds that key drivers to mitigate food crisis among countries vary. Furthermore, a context-specific framework with a more comprehensive definition of urban food systems covering the institutional processes, and food governance are also needed to achieve urban food system sustainability.

KW  - students
AB  - The paper hypothesises that student learning about sustainable development (SD) might usefully be configured within a broad framework combining formal, informal and campus curriculum. Student learning about sustainable development is a form of education for sustainable development (ESD), a term which has many definitions and interpretations. In this paper we refer to both student learning about SD (referring to multiple influences, actions and levels of engagement) and ESD as an overarching formal term (in our work based upon the UNESCO framework for ESD). The term campus sustainability is used when the focus of learning and engagement is based upon or designed around campus-focused projects and activities. We discuss why we believe our broad framework approach is useful and illustrate the practical development of some of these ideas through the early work of our institutional Ecoversity project. Our approach requires bringing together and meshing widely disparate institutional processes and drivers to support wide and multiple levels of student learning about SD. Such institution-wide engagement requires that a number of key 'enablers' are developed, including: academic policy of ESD and SD; academic school engagement with ESD and SD including staff development and training; strategically focused processes and projects around the informal curriculum; and campus management practises and processes that support open and transparent decision-making processes and treat all campus projects as educational opportunities. We describe some of the early achievements from our cross institutional ESD projects and reflect on some key learning points.

AB  - Strengthening sustainability in global supply chains requires producers, buyers, and nonprofit organizations to collaborate in transformative cross-sector partnerships (CSPs). However, the role played by nature in such partnerships has been left largely unattended in literature on CSPs. This article shows how strategizing nature helps CSPs reach their transformative potential. Strategizing nature entails the progressive revealing and reconciling of temporal tensions between "plants, profits, and people." We show how a CSP took a parallel approach-recognizing the divergent temporalities of plants, people, and profits as interlaced and mutually determined-toward realizing their objective of implementing living wages in a sub-Saharan African country's the tea industry, simultaneously driven by the revitalization of tea plantations. The promise of better quality tea leaves allowed partners to take a "leap of faith" and to tackle pressing issues before the market would follow. Our findings thus show the potential of CSPs in driving regenerative organizing.

AB  - A growing number of researchers are employing participatory research approaches to address social determinants of health. Despite evidence supporting school-based participatory action research (PAR) approaches as powerful health intervention strategies and recent calls to assess the implementation of PAR processes and outcomes, there is a paucity of research that addresses the meaning of sustainability in participatory health interventions in schools. This case study addresses some of the complexities that emerge when partners with a variety of goals and experiences engage in participatory action research (PAR) within complex institutions. We describe two PAR initiatives within a pragmatic intervention in two middle schools aimed at improving the school environment to promote school engagement and connectedness among adolescents, highlighting perspectives from PAR facilitators and school administrators. Findings underscore complexities of participatory research approaches, including the dynamic and iterative nature of the intervention and limited resources to support collaboration, and stress the role of alignment to existing systems and processes and the need to shift roles and responsibilities in navigating complexities to achieve sustainability. Ultimately, we (re) conceptualize the meaning of sustainability in participatory interventions as a process that is shifting and inseparable from the collaborative, reflective practices characteristic of participatory approaches.

AB  - Soil erosion (SE) and climate change are closely related to environmental challenges that influence human wellbeing. However, the potential impacts of both processes in semi-arid areas are difficult to be predicted because of atmospheric variations and non-sustainable land use management. Thus, models can be employed to estimate the potential effects of different climatic scenarios on environmental and human interactions. In this research, we present a novel study where changes in soil erosion by water in the central part of Iran under current and future climate scenarios are analyzed using the Climate Model Intercomparison Project-5 (CMIP5) under three Representative Concentration Pathway-RCP 2.6, 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios. Results showed that the estimated annual rate of SE in the study area in 2005, 2010, 2015 and 2019 averaged approximately 12.8 t ha(-1) y(-1). The rangeland areas registered the highest soil erosion values, especially in RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 for 2070 with overall values of 4.25 t ha(-1) y(-1) and 4.1 t ha(-1) y(-1), respectively. They were followed by agriculture fields with 1.31 t ha(-1) y(-1) and 1.33 t ha(-1) y(-1). The lowest results were located in the residential areas with 0.61 t ha(-1) y(-1) and 0.63 t ha(-1) y(-1) in RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 for 2070, respectively. In contrast, RCP4.5 showed that the total soil erosion could experience a decrease in rangelands by - 0.24 t ha(-1) y(-1) (2050), and - 0.18 t ha(-1) y(-1) (2070) or a slight increase in the other land uses. We conclude that this study provides new insights for policymakers and stakeholders to develop appropriate strategies to achieve sustainable land resources planning in semi-arid areas that could be affected by future and unforeseen climate change scenarios.

AB  - This research reports the role of disaster policy implementation achieving disaster risk reduction (DRR) and sustainable development (SD) in Sierra Leone. The factors were highlighted to help policymakers measure disaster risk perception (DRP), disaster adaptation (DA), community participation (CP), and disaster policy implementation (DPI) towards achieving disaster risk reduction and sustainable development. A questionnaire was administered to collect data from the respondents in six disaster-prone communities (Dwarzarck, Portee-Rokupa, Kroobay, Susan's Bay, Moyiba, and Colbot) in Freetown, Sierra Leone. Employing the structural equation model approach, we found that all the disaster risk reduction factors (DRP, CP, DA, and DPI) directly influence SD. Furthermore, disaster policy implementation serves as a channel through which disaster risk reduction influences sustainable development. This study suggests to policymakers to use the factors mentioned earlier to design effective disaster policy implementation to achieve disaster risk reduction and sustainable development in Sierra Leone.

AB  - Education is the most important part of sustainable society development. Traditional approaches to permanent lifelong educator training often fail to produce lasting changes in teaching practices (UN, Goal 4). This paper examines how educator involvement in a professional learning community (PLC) ensures equitable quality education and promotes lifelong learning opportunities for all and a sustainable digital transformation of the teaching and learning process. Participation in PLC and the use of contemporary learning environments positively impact the quality of educators' work, thereby enhancing the overall educational process. This study utilised a quantitative methodology, employing both descriptive and inferential statistics to analyse the data. Results indicate that a balanced integration of formal PLC structures and guidance, combined with elements of a non-formal, broader PLC and external incentives and support (such as projects), can surpass mere exchanges of best practices, foster innovation, and support the sustainable digital transformation of educators. This approach leads to a sustainable shift in pedagogical paradigms. The PLC_IP model (focused on including digital technologies and effective teaching strategies) enhances collective educator efficacy, contributing to improved teaching quality. For PLCs to achieve sustainability, they must be dynamic entities that adapt to the evolving educational landscape, ensuring their continued relevance and impact with rising completion rates over time. Our findings underscore the importance of innovative PLCs in driving sustainable educational development and improvement and provide a framework for future research and practical applications in educational settings. In addition, PLCs can strengthen the means of implementation and revitalise the global partnership for sustainable development (UN, Goal 17).

AB  - An analytical framework is developed in this paper in order to explore the diversity of eco-innovations according to several key dimensions (design, user, product service and governance). The framework is used to analyse a set of case studies of eco-innnovation processes. The diversity of the analysed eco-innovations appears to be considerable; each of them involves different kinds of combinations of elements pertaining to those dimensions. Albeit the design dimension is decisive to determine the environmental impacts of the innovation, all dimensions can play a significant role in the management of eco-innovation. Our findings suggest that the capacity of eco-innovations to provide new business opportunities and contribute to the transformation towards a sustainable society depends on the interplay of those dimensions and the engagement of key stakeholders in the innovation process.

AB  - Road traffic injuries (RTIs) are a growing public health problem that must be addressed through evidence-based interventions including policy-level changes such as the enactment of legislation to mandate specific behaviors and practices. Policy makers need to be engaged in road safety research to ensure that road safety policies are grounded in scientific evidence. This paper examines the strategies used to engage policy makers and other stakeholder groups and discusses the challenges that result from a multi-disciplinary, inter-sectoral collaboration. A framework for engaging policy makers in research was developed and applied to describe an example of collective road safety research in Malaysia. Key components of this framework include readiness, assessment, planning, implementation/evaluation, and policy development/sustainability. The case study of a collaborative intervention trial for the prevention of motorcycle crashes and deaths in Malaysia serves as a model for policy engagement by road safety and injury researchers. The analytic description of this research process in Malaysia demonstrates that the framework, through its five stages, can be used as a tool to guide the integration of needed research evidence into policy for road safety and injury prevention.

It was also concluded that SD-oriented student knowledge is a mediator in these relationships.Research limitations/implicationsAn underlying argument is that students with SD-oriented knowledge engage in proactive behaviors, taking the best HEI initiatives as a precedent among students of the HEIs belonging to the RCS-PT.Practical implicationsHEI initiatives can be drivers for proactive student behaviors regarding SD. Thus, this study brings guidance to university leaders and other stakeholders. The findings can also be useful for those involved in planning SD-oriented actions in HEIs.Social implicationsStrengthen the role of higher education as co-creators of change by promoting the principles of SD in future professionals. Education is a strong instrument for behavioral change, so HEIs play a fundamental role here having a direct impact on society.Originality/valueThis research sought to expand the dialogue about SD in HEIs, especially in achieving sustainable development goals, intertwined with the idea of participation and engagement of students.

AB  - Increasing interests in marine areas has led to conflicts, and planning of present and future uses is required to achieve sustainable management. Marine Spatial Planning (MSP) is dealt at a national level, but generally it includes ecological, physical processes and administrative jurisdictions of multiple countries. The transboundary cooperation on MSP is a complex challenge, that could be better addressed with a participatory process, to achieve coherent planning processes in shared marine socio-ecological systems. This paper focuses on the process followed to reach consensus on cross-border MSP in archipelagic remote regions with no visible and distant maritime borders. Among the results obtained is the design of a European Macaronesia (Canary Islands, Madeira & Azores) Ocean Pilot Program. This would allow to strengthen marine governance, create synergies between different MSP plans, and comply with EU regulations. A joint position of the European Macaronesia could also be an opportunity for maritime interests in national, European, and international forums. Both the participatory process and the results obtained can serve as a model for application in other transboundary marine areas of the world

AB  - Companies are perceived as important actors in the drive for sustainability. Linked to this, and in response to increasing demands from various stakeholder groups. companies start to look at their supply chain to enhance their overall sustainability profile. Two major triggers can be identified: (1) focal companies are held responsible for environmental and social problems caused by their suppliers, which become more and more important as (2) an increasing share of value is created at the supplier level. In response to such demands, companies have to find ways to incorporate environmental and social aspects into their supply (chain) management. Therefore, environmental and social standards are integrated into supply management by amending the purchasing processes. This paper presents one approach to integrate social and environmental standards into supply policy and supply management at the Volkswagen AG, a focal company of the automobile industry.

AB  - Achieving long-term sustainability in environmental restoration requires integrating behavioral science into policy design, yet cognitive biases that shape agricultural decisions remain overlooked. This study introduces the REPAIR framework, a novel interdisciplinary approach that addresses these biases to improve water management strategies. Using a qualitative case study of 148 farmers in Mahabad, Iran, we apply a grounded theory approach to identify key biases-such as confirmation bias, status quo bias, and the bandwagon effect-that reinforce unsustainable irrigation practices and limit farmers' responsiveness to ecological risks. The REPAIR framework (Revenue, Experience, Participation, Availability, Insight, and Relationship) provides structured interventions, incorporating incentive structures, experiential learning, and collective action mechanisms. By integrating insights from Ostrom's Design Principles and behavioral decision-making theories, REPAIR enhances policy effectiveness in common-pool resource governance. This study underscores the necessity of embedding behavioral science into environmental restoration, offering a scalable, evidence-based tool for policymakers and conservation practitioners. To conclude, addressing cognitive biases is not just complementary to ecological restoration-it is fundamental to ensuring lasting environmental and socio-economic resilience.

AB  - Stakeholder participation and interactions in collaborative environmental policymaking are complex. We explore how stakeholder participation in rule-drafting and public comments lead to high-quality voluntary standards to promote green transition from a configurational perspective. Applying a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis to China's 78 Industrial Cleaner Production Standards, we identify three paths resulting in superior standards. While using third-party experts is necessary in all paths, two paths emphasize the central role of public research institutes and the substitutive relationship between the participation of regulated firms and industry associations in the rule-drafting stage, especially in highly regulated industries. The third path emphasizes the importance of broad public comments when stakeholder participation in rule-drafting is insufficient, especially in lightly regulated industries. Our work enriches the theory of environmental regulation and collaborative governance, which is also instructive for governments designing regulatory standards to promote sustainable transformation.

KW  - PEOPLE
AB  - Policy development and implementation are key to improving access to Assistive Technology (AT). In this paper, we describe a strength-based framework for doing this at national level. We used an action research approach, with the United Nations Conventions on the Rights of Persons with Disability (UNCRPD) as the primary frame of reference. Primary data were collected using the World Health Organisation's rapid Assistive Technology Assessment (rATA). We describe the process of applying our emergent framework and how our findings support it. We identified seven guiding principles for effective policy process: Participatory, Resource aware, Outcomes focused, Collaborative, Evidence-informed, supporting good practices, and System strengthening - which can be summarized by the acronym PROCESS. Five crucial building blocks for effective AT policy development emerged: Identification of the assistive technology ecosystem, Demography of disability and AT use, Evaluation of inclusion and participation in existing policy, Alignment with UNCRPD and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and Locality of implementation - which can be summarized with the acronym IDEAL. The IDEAL PROCESS incorporates key content building blocks and core process principles, constituting a systematic framework for guiding the development of context sensitive AT policy and a strength-based pathway to improving access AT.

AB  - While learning competencies in education for sustainable development are increasingly recognized as important, few empirical studies consider competencies delivered at a program level. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate how a program evaluation can be approached through a participatory approach, and what this means for learning competencies for sustainability. The innovative method chosen was to implement a student-led evaluation of the program or a form of practice-based learning whereby students engaged in a participatory evaluation of their own program. This evaluation involved a mixed-methods research design and engaging with different actors-from other students and teachers in the program to alumni, administrators and employers. Students agreed on what competencies to evaluate against, then designed their assessment to gauge how and in what way five key competencies were being delivered. The program delivers competencies for sustainable development, yet there was some discrepancy between what students experienced in the program and what teachers believed to be delivering in the classroom. The learning-by-doing approach suggests that a sixth competency-implementation skills-is relevant to teaching for sustainable development. A participatory, student-led approach to evaluating a Master program is a novel contribution to the literature, which in itself led to the development of competencies for sustainability, particularly strategic, interpersonal and implementation skills.

AB  - Most Chinese cities have spent decades achieving urbanisation. So far, rural urbanisation has shifted to urban renewal. However, the distinction between a rapidly changing social environment and the establishment of an institution has led to the failure of urban renewal policies to sustainably achieve complete transformation through urban modernisation involving many stakeholders. Owing to the top-down political system in China, the formulation and implementation of urban renewal policies are carried out in a closed-loop process in which "decisions are issued by the central government to the local government which gives feedback to the centre". This seems to affect urban renewal through a transfer of renewal policies in a local area. Therefore, it is essential to explore the differences between the urban renewal policies at different government levels and to analyse these policies in diverse urban contexts with multiple stakeholders. Based on the policy transfer theory, this paper selects 216 core policy texts at the state level and at the level of four first-tier cities (Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen), and uses the methods of text mining and semantic analysis to form open coding, axial coding, and selective coding. Furthermore, it discusses the policy transfer and impact mechanism of urban renewal policy at different levels with diverse characteristics of policy subsystems. We found that the transfer of urban renewal policy occurred in China through top-down coercive vertical transfer, bottom-up combination reverse transfer, and voluntary horizontal transfer among cities. Finally, we suggest that "inspiration"-type policy transfer is an effective method to promote urban renewal in China.

AB  - Cold ironing technology, recognized as a tool to reduce emissions while ships are at berth, has been introduced in several European ports aligning with the international and European environmental and legal framework for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The study aims to identify the prospects for cold ironing technology's introduction into Croatian state-owned ports according to European sustainable conditions. The authors surveyed a group of port experts and stakeholders. Response analysis showed that the technology implementation in Croatian ports is feasible, but only 40% of state-owned ports currently dispose of a minimum electric connection power of more than 1 kV. Furthermore, the analysis showed that all surveyed experts confirmed a cold ironing technology application perspective in state-owned ports. Substantial investments and financing demands have to be concerned to achieve sustainable implementation. Significant efforts are still needed to overcome the challenges in the technology application requiring cooperation between stakeholders. The international legislative regulations implemented by the IMO insist on the safety of ships and people, respecting both the security of navigation at sea and overall operations in the port.

AB  - Addressing human-made environmental problems such as deforestation is an ongoing educational challenge. Promising educational approaches include cooperative decision-making and attempt via a high level of motivation to promote pro-environmental behaviors. Knowledge about the forest ecosystem, including its threats, is supposed to strengthen responsibilities and individual behavioral preferences. The "Save the Forests!" module engages students in hands-on learning activities under the frame of an educational Escape Game (Edu Breakout). Based on nine workstations, it includes various cooperative activities focusing on the forest ecosystem, its ecosystem services, and common tree species. Students realize advantages of recycling, gain insight into paper production and associated resource consumption, compare eco-labels for sustainable paper products, and reflect on consumer decisions. Additionally, the students learn about habitat situations after clear-cutting, forest fires, or storm damages (succession), including strategies for dealing with deadwood based on scientific data. Besides experiments and challenging tasks, students learn about the ecological footprint and greenwashing by clarifying often-used terms in sustainability contexts. In an accompanied quantitative study approach, students participating in the learning module significantly increased their knowledge scores in a pre-post comparison (n = 135, p < 0.001, d = 0.58).

The objective of the developed framework is to enable stakeholders in Food, Water, and Energy sectors to evaluate resources utilization for sustainable productivity. The framework shows that the interdependence of water and energy requirements can be modeled using public domain data. Three different scenarios were structured using five components: location of the farm and market, irrigation system, crops and area. The scenarios were applied in the study area which is Moghra as a part of the Egyptian national 1.5 million feddan project to investigate the effect of crop type, size and location of the farm on the water and energy consumption. Based on the scenarios' results, the model is a helpful tool for stakeholder to include their data in the model to design their scenarios to get quantitative and spatial information about the WEF.(c) 2023 THE AUTHORS.

AB  - The Western Highlands of Guatemala are dominated by small-scale farming in indigenous communities. Mountain conditions and overpopulation have led to expansion of the agricultural frontier with consequent degradation, decreasing yields, poverty and malnutrition. Several non-government organizations (NGO) have carried out interventions to rescue themilpasystem and diversify farming systems. We used the Framework for the Evaluation of Management Systems using Indicators (MESMIS) to evaluate farm sustainability after such interventions. We analysed data from four participating NGOs, interviewing 50 farmers with several years of collaboration as alternative systems, and 50 farmers of recent incorporation as reference systems. A trend towards moderate improvements was found in yields, food availability and reduced losses due to pests, diseases and climatic events. Given the environmental conditions and farm size it seems unlikely that most farms could achieve food self-sufficiency. In some cases, the increase in yields and food security correlate with a higher external input dependence. Even with agroecological interventions, external inputs might be needed. Direct indicators need to be measured in future studies for soil quality and erosion control. Even though the study cases showed regional differences, it was possible to develop a common, robust group of indicators, along with some case-specific ones.

AB  - In today's globalised world, the needs of English language learners have changed, particularly those learning to use the English language as a lingua franca. Growing research showcasing the global use of English as a lingua franca (ELF), the creativity of ELF users, and the diverse ways in which they negotiate successful communication in multilingual encounters has numerous implications for the field of TESOL. This article reports on a study with preservice and in-service TESOL practitioners taking a Global Englishes for Language Teaching (GELT) option course in a 1-year Master's in TESOL programme at a Russell Group university in the United Kingdom. The study explores attitudes towards GELT but also towards the proposals for, and barriers to, curriculum innovation as well as factors influencing such attitudes. Interviews (n = 21) and questionnaires (n = 47) revealed that attitudes remain norm bound, yet the study revealed a positive orientation towards GELT and provided insights into the feasibility of GELT-related curriculum innovation and teacher education syllabus design. The study calls for more research with preservice and in-service TESOL practitioners at different stages of the innovation process to ensure successful and sustainable GELT curricular innovation.

AB  - The fields of Environmental Conflict Management (ECM), Environmental Conflict Resolution (ECR), and Peace and Conflict Impact Assessment (PCIA) have become well established; however, as yet there has not been much use of Social Impact Assessment (SIA) to manage environmental conflicts. ECM, ECR and PCIA are mainly undertaken when problems are advanced or, more likely, have run their course (post-conflict). This paper examines how conflict is addressed by SIA and whether there is potential to develop it for more proactive assessment of conflicts (pre-conflict or while things develop). SIA has the potential to identify and clarify the cause(s) of environmental and natural resources conflicts, and could possibly enable some avoidance or early mitigation. A promising approach may be for 'conflict-aware' SIA to watch for critical conflict stages or thresholds and to monitor stakeholders. Effective conflict-aware SIA might also significantly contribute to efforts to achieve sustainable development. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Schools have been identified as well placed to support students' wellbeing and encouraging the active participation of children and young people in school life is in line with current English legislation. Student-led research has the potential to create a positive, long-lasting impact. This evaluative systematic literature review (SLR) sought to identify the features of effective student participation in the co-production of whole-school wellbeing strategies, with a focus on Participatory Action Research (PAR) projects. Ten papers published between 2011 and 2021 were identified using the PRISMA framework and evaluated for methodological quality and appropriateness of focus. Several factors were identified as impacting on the success of PAR, including group composition, power balance, and sustainability. The paper concludes that carefully planned PAR projects can result in successful collaboration with students to develop whole-school strategies for a range of issues/topic areas. Further research evaluating the long-term impact of such projects on whole-school practice is warranted.

AB  - The Tampa Bay Community Cancer Network (TBCCN) was formed as a partnership comprised of committed community based organizations (grassroots, service, health care organizations) and a National Cancer Institute designated cancer center working together to reduce cancer health disparities. Adhering to principles of community-based participatory research, TBCCN's primary aims are to develop and sustain outreach, training, and research programs that aim to reach medically underserved, multicultural and multilingual populations within the Tampa Bay tri-county area.
   Using a participatory evaluation approach, we recently evaluated the partnerships' priorities for cancer education and outreach; perspectives on the partnerships' adherence to CBPR principles; and suggestions for sustaining TBCCN and its efforts. The purpose of this paper is to describe implementation and outcomes of this participatory evaluation of a community! academic partnership, and to illustrate the application of evaluation findings for partnership capacity-building and sustainability. Our evaluation provides evidence for partners' perceived benefits and realized expectations of the partnership and illustrates the value of ongoing and continued partnership assessment to directly inform program activities and build community capacity and sustainability.

AB  - Many methodologies have been suggested in the current literature to facilitate scholars and consumers to select environmental friendly products. A basic weakness of such methodologies is the lack of strong sustainability ideas and aspects which are essential for the selection procedures of environmental friendly products. This paper develops an evaluation framework to assist consumers/stakeholders in making rational and effortless evaluation about the sustainability performance of firms/products. Specifically, it provides a quick, clear and comprehensive signal to consumers/stakeholders concerning the extent to which a firm/product contributes to sustainable development. The proposed framework consists of two parts: a) a composite index which (under the triple-bottom-line approach) indicates the allocation of revenues to the different stakeholder groups, and assesses the social and environmental aspects of corporate sustainability performance and b) the transformation of a composite index into a new label which determines the strong or weak sustainability of a product/firm. This framework aims at contributing to the current literature by addressing the weaknesses of previous methodologies which are solely based on either corporate operational or production process labels, as well as on the weak sustainability concept which have made low progress to evaluate the overall sustainable picture of firms/products. Finally, a case study has been carried out to indicate and assess the functionality of the proposed framework. (c) 2018 ElsevierLtd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Achieving sustained competitive advantage in the current business landscape has become an important challenge for both the service and manufacturing sectors. Based on the thematic analysis of the empirical data from expert interviews of 46 professionals from Australia and Pakistan, this study puts forward a framework to achieve sustained competitive advantage. The research employs a dynamic capability (DC) theory lens and creates a foundation for the "sustainable dynamic capabilities" concept for future research. The findings affirm that (1) sustainable dynamic capabilities lead to sustained competitive advantage, (2) sustainable dynamic capabilities lead to corporate sustainability, (3) corporate sustainability leads to sustainable dynamic capabilities, and (4) corporate sustainability acts as a mediator between sustainable dynamic capabilities and sustained competitive advantage. By utilising the proposed framework, practitioners can clearly define their strategies to achieve competitive advantage by implementing sustainability practices. The findings of this research clearly pinpoint the interrelationship between sustainability practices and sustained competitive advantage, and sustainability should be taken as a dynamic capability itself, opening up new avenues for future research.

AB  - The health of urban citizens is largely defined by how their living environments are planned, built, and operated, but scientific and policy discourse about sustainable building has often ignored this. Furthermore, while the complex relations between health and the characteristics of built environments require system-orientated thinking and interdisciplinary interventions, they have-until recently-mainly been addressed with conventionally narrow sector-based (mostly technocratic) approaches (e.g., in regard to energy efficiency or carbon reduction). This paper, however, investigates how health co-benefits are perceived by stakeholders in the field of sustainable building in Vietnam. It examines empirical insights collected from a large-scale household survey-with a focus on a green building-certified project case study-conducted in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, six thematic webinars, and eleven expert interviews. Among other things, the paper points out a challenging mismatch between the high importance homebuyers place on green building health benefits, and the focus of stakeholders on energy-saving benefits, which are not necessarily the homebuyers' most pressing concerns. Therefore, the paper concludes that improved health and well-being should be more strongly considered as co-benefits of green buildings. Equally important is that this paper also brings attention to the essential systemic approach in both academic and practical efforts toward the implementation of the SDG3, to "ensure healthy lives and promote wellbeing for all ages", and SDG 11, "to make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable".

AB  - Pesticides are essential to modern agriculture, significantly enhancing crop yields and quality to ensure global food security. Their critical role in preventing hunger is highlighted by the notable increase in global pesticide trade over the past decade. In Indonesia, pesticide usage has surged, with a 24% rise in registered pesticide formulations between 2017 and 2021. However, this increase presents challenges, particularly in the disposal of empty pesticide containers (EPC), which pose substantial environmental and health risks if improperly managed. To address this, a closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) is proposed as an effective, eco-friendly solution for the management of EPC waste. This study evaluates the implementation of a CLSC for EPC in Indonesia, employing rich picture analysis and stakeholder interviews to identify key challenges, opportunities, and strengths. Notable challenges include regulatory gaps, financial and operational feasibility, and limited farmer engagement. However, opportunities exist in enhancing environmental sustainability, generating economic benefits, and gaining support from industry groups. One key strength is the widespread practice of triple rinsing among farmers, with 62.63% of respondents already adopting this method. This study underscores the important of establishing clear and enforceable regulations, introducing financial incentives and supportive policies, promoting public-private partnerships, creating targeted behavior change interventions, and ensuring organizational commitments and training programs. These insights are crucial in developing a sustainable CLSC, ensuring both environmental and economic benefits.

AB  - This study examines the role of Sheikh NGOs as financial gatekeepers in Yemen's NGO sector, showing how their control over aid distribution reinforces dependency and limits local NGOs' autonomy. Through interviews with 45 stakeholders, the research reveals the challenges that local NGOs face in achieving financial sustainability amid economic instability, political turmoil, and dwindling donor support. The findings indicate a significant asymmetry in funding, with Sheikh NGOs monopolizing resources, which constrains the flexibility and innovation of smaller NGOs. Integrating dependency theory, the study illustrates how reliance on intermediaries reinforces power imbalances, while collective impact theory highlights the potential for transformative partnerships. Successful collaborations, like those between the Youth Leadership Development Foundation and local NGOs, underscore the need for Sheikh NGOs to adopt more supportive roles, empowering smaller organizations. This study calls for a reconfiguration of roles within Yemen's NGO sector, advocating a shift from dependency to partnership. In fostering collaboration and supporting local NGO autonomy, stakeholders can build a more equitable and resilient framework, ultimately enhancing humanitarian efforts in Yemen.

AB  - The sustainability issues have been surmounted in the last decades. The digital disruption caused by blockchains and other digitally backed currencies has raised several serious concerns for policymakers, governmental agencies, environmentalists, and supply chain managers. Alternatively, sustainable resources are environmentally sustainable and naturally available resources which are employable by several regulation authorities to reduce the carbon footprint and attain energy transition mechanisms to support sustainable supply chains in the ecosystem. Using the asymmetric time-varying parameters vector auto-regressions approach, the current study examines the asymmetric spillovers between blockchain-backed currencies and environmentally supported resources. We find clusters between blockchain-based currencies and resource-efficient metals, highlighting similar-class dominance of spillovers. We portrayed several implications of our study for policymakers, supply chain managers, the blockchain industry, sustainable resources mechanisms, and regulatory bodies to emphasize that natural resources play a significant role in attaining sustainable supply chains servicing the benefits to society at large and to other stakeholders.

AB  - Work-integrated learning (WIL) refers to a range of curricular, pedagogic and assessment practices focussed on blending formal learning with workplace concerns. In open and distance learning (ODL), incorporation of student's personal and work related experiences with sustainability concerns, presents a challenge. WIL provides opportunity for development and implementation of place-based, practical pedagogies, thereby enhancing transformation towards sustainability while adding value to ODL. This paper utilises a case study from the National Diploma in Nature Conservation offered by the University of South Africa (Unisa), a major ODL provider in the Global South. In line with the growing popularity of qualitative inquiry in educational research, the case study utilises reflective narrative inquiry to capture and analyse how the WIL component of this qualification contributes to participation and engagement of students in tasks related to communication and sustainability. Apart from blending ODL, WIL and Education for Sustainability (EfS), another unique element involves the process through which WIL is implemented in the case study. This is not based on the typical placement of students at potential employers, but involves a seven day tourist visit simulation and assessment in a local nature reserve, facilitated by Unisa. After an initial pilot run, this format of providing the Unisa nature conservation students with a WIL opportunity has since been fully implemented and is repeated annually with great success. The case study is supplemented with a qualitative assessment of the experience obtained with the inclusion of WIL in this qualification. This assessment is conducted within an empirically validated framework for evaluation of WIL curricula, thereby generating additional insight into facilitation of outcomes. The paper concludes by sharing lessons learned and issues to consider with the implementation of WIL ( including synergies with EfS), as well as providing pointers for decision makers and future research and consideration.

AB  - The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), adopted by the United Nations in 2015, comprise 17 goals developed to balance social, economic, and environmental sustainability. Regional sustainable development can be considered an important part of investment to redevelop brownfields. With breakthroughs in information technology, Taiwan has established a number of open databases. This study uses open datasets of regional socioeconomic and environmental geo-information to develop a regional SDG map and screen suitable brownfield locations for redevelopment. In addition, this study has designed a Brownfield Redevelopment Query model that combines socioeconomic geographic information obtained from big data with sustainable potentiality for evaluating benefit-cost ratios (BCRs). Land stakeholders can obtain useful information prior to brownfield investment. The flexible user interface is useful for exploring the outcomes of the BCRs (consolidation, internalities, and externalities) for four land-use scenarios (residential, industrial, commercial, and other and public land with renewable energy facilities) of brownfield redevelopment. The brownfield redevelopment BCR is positively dominated by operating profits in the reuse stage for two sites. In addition, the externalities BCR value of the studied cases is positive, particularly in converting the residential land if the site is located at Level 4 or Level 5 of the SDG map. Consequently, this study uses a large quantity of transparent information and a flexible user interface to develop a useful evaluation tool and reduce the possible pitfalls associated with brownfield redevelopment for land stakeholders.

AB  - This paper presents the combined use of standard DEMATEL and AHP methodologies in assessing a selected set of criteria for evaluating sustainable forestry goals. Creating a decision-making framework with two participating individuals (the authors of this research) enabled the comparison of individually obtained solutions with the aggregated solutions derived by two methodologies. The use of DEMATEL enabled strategic viewing of the causality relations among criteria and a limited indication of cardinal information (weights) about their importance. Different from DEMATEL, the use of AHP is considered a control mechanism in tactical decision-making situations such as the usage of standard multi-criteria methods for solving forestry-related allocation or selection problems. AHP's role is to derive weights of criteria in a very structured environment based on assumption that criteria are independent and only their mutual importance is relevant for further decision-making. Individual solutions and aggregation schemes for creating group solutions are compared for both methodologies. Critical analysis is given for different aspects of their combined use when treating causalities and the importance of criteria in evaluations of long-term sustainable forestry goals.

AB  - Inclusive innovations have the potential to foster socio-economic development and actively involve local communities in innovation processes in sub-Saharan Africa. The importance of inclusive innovations is emphasized in the public strategies and development programmes in the region. Nevertheless, despite some donor-funded initiatives, there remains a lack of systematic knowledge on how to effectively implement inclusive innovation in communities. This research aims to scrutinize the role of inclusive innovation in Tanzania. We conduct policy analyses of the country's official innovation strategies and investigate the inclusive innovation activities undertaken by 12 innovation hubs. These hubs facilitate interactions among diverse actors, provide necessary facilities and technologies, and offer mentorship and peer support. Our results reveal that the definition and significance of inclusive innovation are presented within the national policies. However, implementation programmes are currently modest and scattered. With a few exceptions, innovation hubs have inadequate understanding and limited resources for implementing inclusive innovations in practice. This research contributes by underscoring the need for comprehensive strategies, capacity-building initiatives, and collaborative efforts to fully leverage inclusive innovation for sustainable development in the region.

AB  - In the field of sustainability, scholars, and policy-makers herald the transformative power of participation in knowledge production. However, a discrepancy between these expectations and the limited understanding of the complex interactions constituting participation processes can be observed. With the aim of critically analysing these complex interactions, this paper develops a conceptual perspective on participation as a relational space which is formed in the interplay of structures and processes. This perspective is applied to the analysis of empirical literature in sustainability research, development research, and science and technology studies. The literature review guided by the proposed conceptualisation systematically draws together the rich experience with participation in knowledge production. Elements constituting participation spaces along the dimensions 'structures' and 'actors' are identified and discussed in relation to 'processes' of space-making: (i) (in)coherences with reference system, (ii) resources, (iii) timing, (iv) expectations, (v) mutual trust, and (vi) worldviews and values. Power relations are found to pervade the three dimensions. Enhanced conceptual-analytical clarity of the elements constituting participation spaces provides a differentiated basis for discussing the transformative power of participatory knowledge production. By stimulating reflexivity on the making of participation, this approach contributes to better understanding when spaces of participation have the capacity to become spaces of transformation.

AB  - Attracting resources to achieve established goals makes social reporting necessary in relation to an organization's stakeholders, and reports on the social impact of resource use and activities have an essential role in increasing stakeholder satisfaction and trust. The COVID-19 pandemic emphasized the importance of sustainable development goals and transparent social reporting for different categories of stakeholders. This paper aims to identify the social reporting dimensions that influence the satisfaction and trust of the primary stakeholders of non-profit organizations in an emerging market (Romania), i.e., managers, employees, members, volunteers, donors, and collaborators. The results reveal the positive influence COVID-19 reporting had on stakeholder satisfaction. The lack of formal reporting has a weak yet statistically significant negative influence on stakeholder satisfaction, thus positively influencing the perceived need for external and internal auditing. Stakeholder trust in an organization is strongly and positively influenced by satisfaction with the organizational activity and internal auditing and is negatively influenced by a lack of formal reporting.

AB  - Introduction With the rapid development of China's pharmaceutical industry, issues of corruption and regulatory effectiveness have become increasingly prominent, posing critical challenges to public health safety and the industry's sustainable development.Methods This paper adopts a bounded rationality perspective and employs a game-theoretic evolutionary approach to establish a tripartite evolutionary game model involving pharmaceutical companies, third-party auditing organizations, and health insurance regulatory agencies. It analyzes the stable strategies of the parties involved and the sensitivity of key parameters within this tripartite game system.Results The study reveals that adherence to health insurance regulations by pharmaceutical companies, refusal of bribes by third-party auditing organizations, and the implementation of lenient regulations by health insurance agencies can form an effective governance equilibrium. This equilibrium state contributes to reducing corruption in the pharmaceutical industry, balancing the interests of all parties, and promoting healthy industry development.Discussion Pharmaceutical companies must balance compliance costs against the risks of non-compliance benefits while maximizing profits; third-party auditing organizations need to choose between fulfilling their duties and accepting bribes, considering their economic benefits and professional reputation; health insurance regulatory agencies adjust their strategies between strict and lenient regulation to maximize social welfare. The paper suggests enhancing policy support, strengthening compliance supervision, improving audit independence, and adjusting regulatory strategies to optimize governance in the pharmaceutical industry. Additionally, the research highlights the role of collaborative efforts among the three parties in achieving sustainable governance. Furthermore, the study conducts a numerical simulation analysis to demonstrate the impact of various parameters on the evolutionary stability of the system, providing practical insights into the implementation of regulatory policies. This research offers new insights for policy formulation and governance in China's pharmaceutical sector, providing significant reference value for guiding the industry's sustainable development.

AB  - This review explores the potential of reviving and cultivating industrial hemp, hereafter hemp only, in Bangladesh, highlighting its historical background and current trends. Despite facing some global challenges, hemp significantly contributes to environmental suitability, economic development, and industrial growth. Different parts of hemp are useful for industrial purposes and some components of it are beneficial for health and ingredients for the drug industry as well, such as CBD oil. The review is based on information from published literature, thematic synthesis, comparative policy analysis, and in-person interviews with semi-structured questionnaires. A regulatory framework named "Ganja Mahal" was established over 150 years ago and functioned properly in Bangladesh; a similar model is also used in other hemp-growing countries worldwide. However, in Bangladesh, the cultivation of hemp is banned due to negative social attitudes and knowledge gaps. Even though hemp can generate vast employment opportunities in agriculture, processing, manufacturing, research, marketing, transportation, and retail sectors. The global market for hemp-derived products is rising gradually; reviving in Bangladesh will boost the country's export earnings and could lead to a position as a prominent supplier of superior hemp goods. This review would apprise policymakers, scholars, and agricultural stakeholders of the importance of hemp in fostering sustainable development to achieve the United Nations' sustainable development goals.

AB  - This study aims to fill an essential gap in the integration of supply chain management (SCM) dynamics by incorporating three key elements: emission reduction efficiency (ERE), Artificial intelligence-based emission reduction technology (AI-ERT), and profit maximization. The primary goal of the research is to determine the best methods by which stakeholders of SCM can attain carbon neutrality. This study examines China, which is trying to reduce carbon dioxide CO2 emissions while dealing with issues related to energy system efficiency. Mathematical models embedded with sensitivity-based optimization strategies are used within the experiments. The sensitivity of the indicators was determined using regression analysis, which provided concise information about the effects of production-related variables on ERE for manufacturers and agents. The findings provide optimum values for profit and price decisions, highlighting the best practices for manufacturers and agents. Agents display significant attention to ERE-enhancing approaches, which improve profit and CO2 emissions. Additionally, we evaluate the impact of subsidies on AI-ERT, uncovering significant implications for production quantity, AI-ERT decisions, and profitability. The work addresses the gap of SCM, highlighting the importance of considering AI-ERT, profit maximization, and ERE together. Additionally, using carbon-neutral SCM techniques helps SCM stakeholders achieve economic goals by optimizing profits while simultaneously advancing environmental sustainability.

AB  - The growth of shared mobility has recently challenged the way mobility has traditionally been conceived. In this perspective, this study investigates the Environmental Life Cycle Costs of Urban Air Mobility (UAM) services to evaluate their potential integration with other transport systems, in the three-time horizons (2025, 2030, 2035). The key area of research was focused on the determination of the cost components of UAM required to calculate the unit costs of UAM transportation. To this end, unitary data and the method from a 2017 EC DG MOVE's report on urban accessibility have been adopted. The analysis confirms that most of the cost is related to the aircraft energy consumption during flight, while the rest is used by ground infrastructure. Moreover, the energy cost is strongly correlated with the distance travelled and the size of the aircraft. The longer the flight and the bigger the aircraft, the higher is the energy cost. Complex cost analysis should be able to support decision-makers in the definition of Sustainable Urban Mobility and their principles of integration, participation, monitoring and evaluation. However, it will be necessary to be able to draw on more consolidated and widespread data over time for the creation of Urban plans for Sustainable Mobility.

AB  - The research object of this study is the in-depth discourse on the sustainability transfer activities of higher education institutions (HEIs) and their contribution to a regional sustainable transformation. For this purpose, a heuristically-derived concept of sustainability transfer is empirically tested with a mixed-methods approach based on the example of Eberswalde University for Sustainable Development (HNEE). The empirical findings demonstrate that the realization of sustainability transfer depends mainly on the personal initiative of teachers and researchers. Major barriers are a lack of time and financial resources. The observed concept of sustainability transfer is applicable to all study and research areas of HNEE. Involvement in sustainability transfer can include the whole of society, from politics, enterprises, and civil society to education and research institutions. Overall, the empirical testing of the concept offered by this study illustrates its practical suitability to capturing specifically those sustainability transfer activities that are not tapped by third mission approaches. This opens up a novel dimension for transfer potential at universities and their role in regional sustainability transformation. It also highlights that the interdependencies between HEIs and practitioners need to be more contextualized with quality criteria such as the value of the transfer performance or level of ambition.

AB  - Lake Malombe is ranked among the most vulnerable inland freshwater shallow lakes in Malawi. The lake has lost over US$79.83 million ecosystem service values from 1999 to 2019 due to rapid population growth, increased poverty, landscape transformation, and over exploitation-hampering the effort to achieve United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), in particular, life underwater (SDG 14), life on land (SDG 15), climate action (SDG 13), and no poverty (SDG 1) and Aichi Biodiversity Targets. In line with the 2021-2030 United Nations' Declaration on massive upscaling of the ecosystems restoration effort, this study applied the contingent valuation method (CVM) and binary logistic regression model to determine the public's willingness to pay (WTP) for ecosystem restoration and the influencing factors. The aim was to integrate science into policy framework to achieve a sustainable flow of ecosystem services (ESs). Qualitative data were collected by employing focus group discussion, key informant interviews, and field observation. Quantitative data were collected using structured questionnaires covering 420 households. The results revealed that 56% of the respondents were willing to pay an average of US$28.42/household/year. These respondents believed that the initiative would improve lake ESs, fish biodiversity, income level, water quality and mitigate climate change impact. Age, gender, literacy, income, social trust, institutional trust, access to extension services, period stay in the area, household distance from the lake, lake ecological dynamics impact, having the hope of reviving the lake health ecological status, perception of having lake ecological restoration program, participation in lake restoration program, access to food from the lake, involved in fishing and Lake Malombe primary livelihood sources significantly (p < 0.05) influenced WTP. This study provides a reference point to policymakers to undertake cost-benefit analysis and develop a practical policy response framework to reverse the situation and achieve United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and Aichi Biodiversity Targets.

AB  - The coastal zone environment is facing challenges such as marine pollution, biodiversity loss, and the decline in ecological functions. To address these complex and interlinked environmental problems, it is particularly important to build an effective collaborative governance network for the coastal environment. The aim of this study is to explore the functioning of the collaborative governance network for the coastal environment, analyze the interactive relationships among different stakeholders, and examine the structure and functions of the governance network. First, this thesis reviews the relevant literature on coastal environmental governance, elaborates on the theories of collaborative governance and network governance, and constructs the theoretical research framework. Subsequently, the Dongtou area in Wenzhou, a typical representative of cooperative environmental governance in the coastal zone of the East China Sea, was selected as part of an exploratory case study. The role positioning and interaction modes of different actors such as local governments, social organizations, enterprises, and citizens in the governance network were analyzed in detail, and the relationships between network nodes, the network structure, and network functioning were investigated. Subsequently, it was found that a successful cooperative governance network for coastal environmental protection is based on the joint action of four operational mechanisms: the trust mechanism, coordination mechanism, learning mechanism, and guarantee mechanism. Based on the above analysis, this paper summarizes the key elements for building an efficient collaborative coastal environmental governance network and proposes strategies to improve the efficiency of governance. This study introduces a novel framework for analyzing the structural and functional aspects of collaborative governance networks that combines a social network analysis with qualitative insights. This methodological innovation enables a more comprehensive understanding of network's functioning mechanisms, and also contributes to the theoretical literature on environmental governance by identifying key factors that determine the success of collaborative networks. It offers actionable recommendations for policy makers and practitioners, emphasizing the importance of building solid relationships with stakeholders and leveraging their resources to achieve sustainable environmental outcomes.

AB  - This study examines how a collaboration's internal and external factors interact over time and how the interactions affect the collaboration's process and effectiveness. Using a process-oriented case study, we examine how a voluntary collaboration that had made marginal gains over several years demonstrated significant progress during the COVID-19 pandemic and civil unrest following the murder of George Floyd on May 25, 2020. Drawing on strong structuration theory, we explore the collaboration's internal efforts, changes in the broader environment, and the interplay between them. Our findings reveal that collaboration's internal efforts and external environment enable and constrain each other, which shapes the collaboration's process and effectiveness. Based on these findings, we contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the collaboration process and effectiveness by (1) using a strong structurational approach to demonstrate processual mechanics of connecting processes and structures in collaboration, and (2) highlighting the emergent nature of collaboration and the importance of learning and adaptability for an effective and sustainable collaboration.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the influence of online collaborative learning experiences on students' digital collaboration skills and on the sustainability of e-collaboration in schools' culture-comparing individualistic versus collectivistic cultures. In addition, we explored how the leadership experience of schools' ICT coordinators was predicted by their sense of professionalism and cognitive, emotional and social aspects of perceived learning (PL), while leading the collaborative projects. The participants were ICT coordinators from 513 Israeli schools; 214 of whom were Hebrew-speakers, and 299 Arabic-speakers. The participants were asked to complete an online questionnaire, which included multiple-choice and open-ended questions. The results showed significant differences between a variety of the coordinator-related variables as a function of learning culture (more individualistic vs.more collectivistic). Coordinators' leadership experience was a powerful predictor of students' digital collaboration skills, but did not predict the sustainability of e-collaboration. Coordinators' emotional PL predicted the sustainability of collaboration in both schools with more individualistic and with more collectivistic learning cultures. The implications of the findings for educational theory and practise are discussed.

AB  - The development of higher education worldwide must be integrated in the context of sustainable development in order to ensure environmental sustainability, social sustainability, and economic sustainability. Knowing that the digitalization process within higher education institutions is continuously expanding, while the digital tools and online learning environments enhance accessibility, flexibility, and efficiency, the purpose of the present paper is to highlight how the use of e-Learning platforms can help sustainable education development from the point of view of students from two universities: a university from Romania and a university from the USA. In order to reach this objective, a quantitative research method was used, aiming to identify the students' opinion on a series of facilities offered by e-Learning platforms that serve as the learning process. Data processing and analysis were conducted by means of specific tests supplied by the SPSS software. The obtained results showed that Moodle users spend approximately 26% more time on the platform than Blackboard users, with a small effect size (d = 0.284), while non-engineering students spend approximately 45% more time on the e-learning platform than engineering students, also with a small effect size (d = 0.458). The evaluation of the efficacy of different educational resources varies based on the e-learning platform used, with a large effect size found for editable files (d = 1.017) and PPT or similar formats (d = 1.2). Also, the efficacy of various applications on the e-learning platform varies by platform type, with a large effect size observed for two-way student-teacher communication (d = 0.819), self-assessment grid tests with immediate feedback (d = 1.072), synchronous online meetings with teachers (d = 1.117), and access to information from previous years (d = 0.89). We conclude that institutions should prioritize platform adaptability and student engagement strategies when implementing e-learning solutions for sustainable development.

AB  - Although the need for sustainability of waste disposal sites (WDS) is largely agreed upon by various stakeholders, there is still a limitation in evaluating sites' sustainability. This study aimed to define ecological sustainability for WDS and develop a framework for its assessment. A WDS's ecological sustain ability was defined as the site's capacity to take up waste without compromising the surrounding ecosystems' health and their abilities to self-regenerate or provide other ecosystem services. A model, called EcoSWaD, was developed in this study to assess the ecological sustainability of WDS. The model has 35 indicators divided into five major themes: (i) location suitability; (ii) operational sustainability; (iii) environmental sustainability; (iv) socioeconomic sustainability; and (v) site capacity sustainability. The EcoSWaD brought together all the different interpretations and indicators in the diverse fields of sustainability study or practice to facilitate a comprehensive and meaningful WDS assessment. Testing the model at the Kiteezi landfill showed that the location, environmental, socioeconomic and site capacity themes at the landfill had low values: 18.7, 19.1, 16.9 and 15, respectively. The operation theme had a very low value of 13.5, showing that the landfill's biggest sustainability concerns stem from site operation and the resultant impact on the environment, local community and site capacity. The overall Sustainability Score of 83.1 showed that the landfill's sustainability is low. A tool for the application of the EcoSWaD can be found at https://ecoswad.org/app/console/.

AB  - PurposeThe impact and collective threat of climate change is of key concern to all. Music and arts education can play a role by responding to the ongoing climate crisis through the creation of artworks as activism. This paper discusses a collaborative online international music project and its potential contribution to sustainable development education.Design/methodology/approach 10,427 miles and 11 hours apart, music education students undertook the project, working in groups with a mix of students from Aberdeen, Scotland and Melbourne, Australia in each group. Each student collected video footage that captured their experience of climate concerns related to their environment. Students combined and edited the footage then collaboratively composed music to accompany the footage. This research was conceived as a collaborative self-study project undertaken by the authors as music teacher educators.FindingsThe results show a range of musical and extra musical outcomes and challenges. Evidence suggests that a collaborative online international music learning experience may contribute to sustainable development education and regenerative practice more broadly. Students began to develop their practice as educators for school and community contexts embedding learning for sustainability and climate consciousness, thus enabling them to develop as active global citizens.Originality/valueThis paper argues for greater attention to the affordances of digital collaborative music technology tools to facilitate creative projects as well as the need to reimagine musical experience, drawing together strands of music, sustainability education, technology and global citizenship. This paper also argues for the importance of embedding the UN Sustainable Development Goals in teaching and learning in Higher Education.

TI  - The tripartite partnership between female entrepreneurs, banks and governments in female entrepreneurship-development: a case study of Zambia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ORGANIZATIONAL ANALYSIS
LA  - English

KW  - Bank lending
KW  - Government policy
KW  - Female entrepreneurs
KW  - Female entrepreneurship-development
AB  - Purpose
   This paper aims to provide insights on the void between the needs and demands of bank finance from female entrepreneurs and the supply, as well as the approaches of banks for that finance. In addition, it creates a conceptual framework recognising a tripartite and dynamic partnership amongst female entrepreneurs, banks and governments as essential to female entrepreneurship-development, based on Zambia as the context.
   Design/methodology/approach
   Concepts and theories are explained to construct a conceptual framework using the lens of multi-polar network theory and stakeholder engagement theory. In-depth discussions are facilitated through a bilateral partnership between each party and tripartite partnerships amongst female entrepreneurs, banks and governments.
   Findings
   The framework presents how female entrepreneurs, banks and governments are interconnected in the network as mutually benefiting stakeholders and shows their collective contribution to female entrepreneurship-development within certain contexts. The findings suggest that the sustainable development of female entrepreneurship depends on a dynamic tripartite partnership amongst female entrepreneurs, banks and governments.
   Research limitations/implications
   The conceptual framework has important implications when setting up a nation's enterprise development strategies and policies promoting inclusivity and diversity amongst a nation's entrepreneurs. The contributions and the dynamic relationship of the three stakeholder groups should be acknowledged and considered to achieve sustainable development in female entrepreneur enterprises. The framework can be generalised to other emerging economies with similar social, economic and cultural profiles to Zambia, particularly in sub-Saharan African countries with patriarchal norms.
   Originality/value
   This paper extends multi-polar (network) theory and stakeholder management engagement theory, previously explained in homogeneous firms, to more complex and dynamic partnerships amongst heterogeneous organisations, i.e. female entrepreneurs, banks and governments.

AB  - Global key drivers-e.g., climate change, COVID-19 outbreak-have initiated critical debates as to the sustainable future pathways of many regions around the globe. Among these fall islands, as distinct types of regions that are marked by insularity drawbacks and a mono-sectoral economic profile, grounded in mass tourism. Having as a case study area all Greek islands, this work addresses: sustainability concerns that are due to the mass tourism repercussions in these heritage-endowed territories; and efforts undertaken by the Greek insular municipalities to deploy, in a collaborative manner, strategic cultural tourism plans in support of the transition from a resource-intensive mass tourism pattern to natural and cultural heritage-led future developmental trails. Towards this end, a two-stream methodological approach is used that relies on: quantitative, spatially-defined data elaboration/interpretation and visualization, highlighting the dynamics of tourism development in island territories; and qualitative data on issues related to the aforementioned plans from all insular municipalities, gathered through a web-based questionnaire. Research results unveil the unsustainable spatial and developmental patterns of Greek insular contexts and the shortage of mainstream planning expertise for collaboratively establishing attractive cultural-tourism ensembles. These factors restrain sustainability achievements and the repositioning of Greek islands in the global scenery as authentic heritage-led destinations.

AB  - Educational institutions are envisioned as principal agents for addressing the current sustainability challenge that society is facing. Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) is transformational and concerns learning content and outcomes, pedagogy and the learning environment in itself. ESD entails rethinking the learning environment (physical and virtual) in line with sustainable development, which implies classrooms' transformation towards learner engagement, formative assessments and active methodologies. This paper responds to this need through exploring the relationship between Smart Classrooms and four widely used ESD methodologies (project or problem-based learning, case study, simulation and cooperative inquiry), identifying how the dimensions and categories of the characteristics of Smart Classrooms can contribute and lead to the implementation of ESD methodologies in real teaching practice in an effective way. The method used in this study consisted of a literature review of both theoretical frameworks separately, ESD and Smart Classrooms, and a subsequent expert analysis to identify the interrelation between both. The Smart Classroom shows a high level of adequacy for using problem and project-based learning, case study and cooperative inquiry methods because of its characteristics in terms of technology developments, environmental conditions and processes. Simulation is the ESD methodology with the lowest level of adequacy in a Smart Classroom, because it is primarily held online rather than through face-to-face teaching. Smart Education facilitates the putting in practice of ESD processes as it enables the creation of intelligent, sustainable, resource-efficient, personalised and adaptive learning environments. Further empirical research is needed to explore the influence that the Smart Classroom has in enabling ESD processes and practices, and to identify students' and teachers' needs at different education levels. Additionally, teacher training programmes focused on the correct use of Smart Classrooms and on the digital competence of teachers are critical to its successful implementation.

AB  - The escalating demands from legislative authorities and stakeholders for companies to adopt corporate sustainability measures underscore the growing importance of strategic sustainability management. Despite the efforts made by companies in this domain, the strategic management of sustainability in family businesses remains an under-researched area. To address this gap, we conducted a systematic literature review covering the period from 2006 to 2022, on the topic of strategic sustainability management in family businesses. Our investigation encompasses a content analysis of 98 relevant studies. Our research question is: "What aspects are taken into account by family businesses in their corporate sustainability strategies?" We tackle this issue through a methodological triangulation of qualitative and quantitative methods. Our results yield three clusters of strategies for corporate sustainability in family businesses: (1) Family values and succession planning; Stakeholder relations and communication; (2) Risk taking, Inventions, and Technologies; and (3) Entrepreneurship and Intrapreneurship. In addition, we systematically present a range of descriptive indicators, including the research methodologies applied and the geographic focus of the published literature. This research contributes significant insights for scholars and practitioners alike, providing valuable guidance in this field. Moreover, our study paves the way for further investigations into the strategies that influence sustainability within the context of family businesses. By shedding light on this critical area, we aim to foster a more sustainable and informed approach to corporate practices among family-owned enterprises.

AB  - The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil, as a form of neoliberal environmental governance operating beyond-the-state, seeks to address its democratic deficit and gain legitimacy through deliberative and consultative processes. The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil requires companies to conduct participatory social impact assessment for both new developments and existing operations in an attempt to identify and address the critical social impacts associated with palm oil production. Using a political ecology framework, and a mixed methods approach, this study explores social impact assessments as sites of power struggles, to understand the contestations, inequities, and marginalizations that occur in social impact assessment processes. By exploring the nature of social impact assessment as a market-led regime that privileges certain knowledges and politics, and is co-opted and controlled by powerful actors, the paper challenges the notion that social impact assessment can ensure the inclusion of previously marginalized people in decision-making processes. Participation in social impact assessment is found to be, at most, consultative and top-down, and risks the further disempowerment of affected peoples. By viewing social impact assessment as a discrete intervention, without a clear wider political project for social change for local peoples and workers, the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil risks 'rendering technical' and 'marketable' the multifaceted social impacts associated with palm oil production as it simultaneously enacts particular global, neoliberal 'participatory' strategies that are applied locally in ways that (re-)produce hegemony and legitimacy.

AB  - Examples of sustainable land management (SLM) exist throughout the world. In many cases, SLM has largely evolved through local traditional practices and incremental experimentation rather than being adopted on the basis of scientific evidence. This means that SLM technologies are often only adopted across small areas. The DESIRE (DESertIfication mitigation and REmediation of degraded land) project combined local traditional knowledge on SLM with empirical evaluation of SLM technologies. The purpose of this was to evaluate and select options for dissemination in 16 sites across 12 countries. It involved (i) an initial workshop to evaluate stakeholder priorities (reported elsewhere), (ii) field trials/empirical modeling, and then, (iii) further stakeholder evaluation workshops. This paper focuses on workshops in which stakeholders evaluated the performance of SLM technologies based on the scientific monitoring and modeling results from 15 study sites. It analyses workshop outcomes to evaluate how scientific results affected stakeholders' perceptions of local SLM technologies. It also assessed the potential of this participatory approach in facilitating wider acceptance and implementation of SLM. In several sites, stakeholder preferences for SLM technologies changed as a consequence of empirical measurements and modeling assessments of each technology. Two workshop examples are presented in depth to: (a) explore the scientific results that triggered stakeholders to change their views; and (b) discuss stakeholders' suggestions on how the adoption of SLM technologies could be up-scaled. The overall multi-stakeholder participatory approach taken is then evaluated. It is concluded that to facilitate broad-scale adoption of SLM technologies, de-contextualized, scientific generalisations must be given local context; scientific findings must be viewed alongside traditional beliefs and both scrutinized with equal rigor; and the knowledge of all kinds of experts must be recognised and considered in decision-making about SLM, whether it has been formally codified or not. The approach presented in this paper provided this opportunity and received positive feedback from stakeholders.

TI  - Applying adaptive management in resource use in South African National Parks: A case study approach
T2  - KOEDOE
LA  - English
KW  - RUMOHRA-ADIANTIFORMIS

KW  - LAND
AB  - South African National Parks (SANParks) has a history of formal and informal natural resource use that is characterised by polarised views on national conservation interests and benefits to communities. Current efforts aim to determine the sustainability of existing resource use in parks and to formalise these activities through the development of resource use protocols. The resource use policy of SANParks outlines principles for sustainable resource use, including greater involvement of local communities in management of protected areas and an adaptive management approach to determining sustainable use levels. This paper examines three case studies on plant use in national parks with regard to the development of criteria and indicators for monitoring resource use, and the role of thresholds of potential concern in measuring effectiveness of managing for sustainable use levels. Opportunities and challenges for resource use management are identified. Findings show that platforms for discussion and knowledge sharing, including research committees and community associations, are critical to building relationships, trust and a shared vision of sustainable resource use between stakeholders. However, additional capacity building is needed to enable local community structures to manage internal social conflicts and jealousy, and to participate fully in monitoring efforts. Long-term monitoring is essential for developing flexible harvest prescriptions for plant use, but this is a time-consuming and resource-intensive exercise. Flexible management strategies are difficult to implement and sometimes command-and-control measures are necessary to protect rare or endangered species. A holistic approach that considers resource use in national parks as a complement to broader community development initiatives offers a way forward.
   Conservation implications: There is no blueprint for the development of sustainable resource use systems and resource use is often addressed according to multiple approaches in national parks. However, the SANParks resource use policy provides a necessary set of guiding principles for resource use management across the national park system that allows for monitoring progress.

AB  - Soils form the basis for agricultural production and other ecosystem services, and soil management should aim at improving their quality and resilience. Within the SoilCare project, the concept of soil-improving cropping systems (SICS) was developed as a holistic approach to facilitate the adoption of soil management that is sustainable and profitable. SICS selected with stakeholders were monitored and evaluated for environmental, sociocultural, and economic effects to determine profitability and sustainability. Monitoring results were upscaled to European level using modelling and Europe-wide data, and a mapping tool was developed to assist in selection of appropriate SICS across Europe. Furthermore, biophysical, sociocultural, economic, and policy reasons for (non)adoption were studied. Results at the plot/farm scale showed a small positive impact of SICS on environment and soil, no effect on sustainability, and small negative impacts on economic and sociocultural dimensions. Modelling showed that different SICS had different impacts across Europe-indicating the importance of understanding local dynamics in Europe-wide assessments. Work on adoption of SICS confirmed the role economic considerations play in the uptake of SICS, but also highlighted social factors such as trust. The project's results underlined the need for policies that support and enable a transition to more sustainable agricultural practices in a coherent way.

AB  - Background: A multidisciplinary care model involving the interventional radiologist, vascular surgeon, interventional nephrologist, renal advanced nurse practitioner, and renal coordinators was implemented to improve the care for the patient admitted with dysfunctional hemodialysis access. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness and sustainability of this multidisciplinary care model. Method: A dedicated interventional nephrology suite was established to perform endovascular procedures for patients admitted with hemodialysis access dysfunction via the emergency department of the hospital. We retrospectively collected data from electronic medical records 1-year before and after the implementation (April 2015). Outcome measures include waiting time for intervention, length of stays (LOS), number of dialysis catheter insertions before the intervention, number of inpatient dialysis required, and success rates of the interventions. The waiting time for intervention and LOS was tracked over the next 3 years to determine the sustainability of the care model. Results: Eight hundred eighty-one endovascular interventions (314 angioplasties, 567 thrombolysis) were performed on 554 patients. Post-implementation, a greater proportion of intervention was performed within 24 h (238 (50.2%) vs 70 (17.2%), p < 0.001) with lesser proportion of patients requiring bridging hemodialysis via temporary catheter, 156 (32.9%) versus 215 (52.8%), p < 0.001. A shorter median LOS and days-to-intervention were reported, 3 (IQR 2-6) versus 5 days (IQR 3-8), p < 0.001 and 1 (IQR 1-2) versus 3 days (IQR 2-4), p < 0.001 respectively. Less hemodialysis session/patient required, 2 (IQR 1-3) versus 3 (IQR 2-4), p < 0.001. The procedural success rate was greater, 440 (92.8%) versus 355 (87.2%), p = 0.020. Three years following implementation, the proportion of patients who received intervention within 24 h and were discharged within 48 h was reported to be persistently greater, 43% versus 13%, p < 0.001, and 27% versus 6%, p < 0.001 respectively. Discussion: This multi-disciplinary collaboration demonstrated a sustainable care model in improving the delivery of healthcare services for patients with dysfunctional hemodialysis access.

AB  - This paper provides reflections on transdisciplinary knowledge coproduction and experimentation processes from sustainability researcher perspectives. It centers on a 5-year period of collaborative research with small- and medium-sized enterprises in an Urban Living Lab in the Swedish craft beer sector. Nine reflections cover a variety of issues and potentials encountered during numerous interactions with societal partners, and are structured by three levels: organizational, interpersonal and intrapersonal. Based on the reflections, authors then propose a set of seven considerations and recommendations for how to more effectively collaborate in such transdisciplinary constellations. The recommendations apply across the three levels, and describe an approach to collaborative research that asks the researcher to be open, transparent, self-aware and intentional, reflective and reflexive, and both adaptive and flexible. Furthermore, they aim to create soft structures to facilitate understanding and mutual learning, such as designating "organizational champions", as well as to embed collaborative reflections into recurring meetings with partners to maintain trust and capture sustainability knock-on opportunities as they arise.

AB  - Current approaches for measuring and assessing contributions of companies and their products to sustainability largely focus on reducing negative impacts. However, becoming "less bad" still means having adverse impacts on the environment. Various authors have therefore called for investigating how positive contributions can be made to further sustainable development. This systematic literature review explores how positive contributions to sustainability have been discussed in the environmental management literature dealing with sustainability performance measurement and assessment. Our review of 328 publications reveals an understanding of positive contributions to sustainability that is a mostly implicit or vague use. Inductive analysis, however, reveals three distinct understandings - an operationalization, a stakeholder and a transformation perspective - each of which is embedded in a different theoretical frame, namely decision, stakeholder and transition theory. These per-spectives have so far been discussed separately in the literature. By drawing on theoretical foundations of per-formance measurement, we propose an integrated understanding of positive contributions to sustainability: A positive sustainability contribution has the goal of bringing about a sustainability transformation, considers the environmental, economic and social context through stakeholder participation, and is operationalized to facil-itate decision-making and the implementation of effective sustainability measures. A clear definition is of key importance for both research and practice to both reduce negative and increase positive contributions to sus-tainable development.

AB  - The main aim of this study was to define and apply a multidisciplinary and multi-criteria approach to sustainability in evaluating alternative end-uses for disused areas. Taking into account the three pillars of sustainability (social, economic and environmental dimension) as well as the need for stakeholders to have new practical instruments, the innovative approach consists of four modules stated (i) sociological, (ii) economic, (iii) environmental and (iv) multi-criteria assessment. By means of a case study on a small Municipality in Southern Italy, three end-uses alternatives, representing three essential services for citizens, were selected: Municipal gym; Market area; Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) separate collection centre. The sociological module was useful to select the most socially sound alternative by means of a consultative referendum, simulated with the use of a structured questionnaire administered to a sample of the population. The economic evaluation was conducted defining the bill of quantities with regarding to six main items (soil handling, landfill disposal tax, public services, structure and services, completion work, equipment and furnishings). The environmental evaluation was performed applying the Delphi method with local technicians who were involved in a qualitative-quantitative evaluation of the three alternatives with regarding to eight possible environmental impacts (landscape impact, soil handling, odour, traffic, noise, atmospheric pollution, wastewater, waste). Finally, the Simple Additive Weighting was used as multi-criteria technique to define alternatives priorities. The obtained results showed how the multi-criteria analysis is a useful decision support tool able to identify transparently and efficiently the most sustainable solutions to a complex social problem.

AB  - Purpose Corporate sustainability in China has become a subject of increasing international concern. Corporate sustainability disclosure (CSD) is considered a useful tool to facilitate the empowerment and acknowledgement of stakeholders in the quest for sustainability. However, the degree of cultural and political influences for being sustainably orientated can be significantly different between countries. This study aims to examine the perception of financial analysts, as CSD report users, in China about the level of importance of various indicators of corporate sustainability described in the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Sustainability Reporting Guidelines. Design/methodology/approach A set of questionnaires was developed based on GRI G4 guidelines to measure the perception of financial analysts in China on the level of importance of each sustainability indicator described in the GRI G4. A five-point Likert scale was used to measure the report users' perceptions of each of the indicators. Findings The findings of this study increase our understanding of how Chinese CSD report users perceive corporate sustainability differently from the GRI guidelines. The main results show that the environmental aspect of sustainability was seen to be important in China, followed by the social and economic aspects. Indicator-wise, "water", "effluents and waste", "emissions", "compliance" and "energy" were perceived as vital in the environmental category, while "customer health and safety", "customer privacy" and "compliance" were considered significant in the social category. Originality/value This study addresses the need for differing corporate sustainability guidelines for different nations and cultures, specifically within the Chinese context. It also contributes to the corporate sustainability literature by adding to our understanding of how financial analysts in China, as CSD report users, perceive aspects of sustainability.

AB  - Global sustainability targets demand transformative changes. Nature-based solutions (NbS) are gaining traction in science and policy, but their potential for transformative change remains unexplored. We provide a framework to evaluate how NbS contribute to transformative change and apply it to 93 NbS from mountain social-ecological systems (SES). The framework serves to assess what elements may catalyze transformative change, how transformative change occurs, and what its outcomes are. Our results show that NbS are as much "people based'' as "nature based.'' Most NbS are based on four elements with transformation poten-tial: nature's values, knowledge types, community engagement, and nature management practices. Our results confirm the potential of NbS for transformative change, observed through changes in non-sustainable trajectories of SES. We illustrate the components of our framework through a novel classification of NbS. The framework provides key components for assessing the effectiveness of NbS and allows tracking long-term transformative change processes.

AB  - Sustainable supplier management goes beyond a simple compliance with standards and norms defined by a purchaser or being only effective in terms of economic performance in sustainable supply chain management context. Buying firms are seeking to adopt the sustainable supplier management in their supply chains as they are responsible for their suppliers' environmental and social performances. Previous researches on sustainable supplier management indicate that evaluation of suppliers' sustainability has attracted a great attention from practitioners while suppliers' sustainability development has been widely neglected. One of the development programs for suppliers is performance improvement. Two significant issues need to be considered for implementation of suppliers' improvement program; first, considering time in evaluation process and continuity in improvement, second, applying stepwise or gradual approach as sudden and huge changes in inputs and outputs may be impossible or troublesome. To this end, we propose a data envelopment analysis (DEA)-based model to incorporate dynamic concept into gradual improvement approach. Given proposed model, carry-overs between two consecutive periods are considered in a dynamic environment and also inefficient suppliers are projected to efficiency frontier step-by-step. An illustrative case study in machinery industry is proposed to indicate applicability of proposed model. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This narrative review critically assesses the implementation and purported success of co-management in forest management in Bangladesh. Co-management has gained global popularity, celebrated for its participatory approach to natural resource conflict resolution, yet critiqued for potential design flaws, susceptibility to elite capture, and perpetuating power imbalances in predominantly top-down management cultures. Despite two decades of application and reports of positive outcomes in managing forest protected areas of Bangladesh, concerns persist regarding the authenticity of its success and sustainability, particularly in terms of power dynamics and effective community participation in decision-making processes. The review delves into these aspects, revealing instances where successes might be superficial, overlooking the underlying issues of power disparity among stakeholders. It highlights the crucial role of enhancing social capital within co-management frameworks to foster institutionalization and sustainability. Recommendations include advancing robust collaboration and communication, alongside the adoption of adaptive management practices to navigate the complex interplay of natural, social, and institutional challenges.

AB  - Considering the environmental deterioration challenges and a sharp decline in the quality and quantity of natural resources, the need for capitalizing on renewable energy sources and environment-friendly practices has increased a lot. The United Nations also has urged firms to shift their reliance on fossil fuels to renewable and eco-friendly practices. Several nations have begun shifting from economic growth to green productivity practices, such as green finance, green innovation, etc., which signifies collaboration between the economy, resources, and ecological development to achieve sustainable development goals (SDGs). This study is based on a comprehensive index of green finance development. Using the nonparametric data envelopment analysis and directional distance function (DEA-DFF) model, it examines the impact of green finance, financial development and green technology innovation (GTI) on green total factor productivity (GTFP) in 28 Chinese provinces from 2011 to 2021. The findings indicate that green finance raises the degree of green productivity significantly. Other elements, such as financial development and technological innovation, contribute significantly to green production. It is also found that establishing green finance legislation can help accelerate the growth of green finance. The empirical findings in this study have policy implications for China's environmental and green finance planning. This study is among the pioneer investigations integrating green finance, financial development, and green technology innovation into a unified research framework.

AB  - The development of an ecosystem approach to fisheries management makes the assessment of the sustainability performance of fisheries a priority. This study examines European tropical tuna purse seine fleets as a case study, employing a multidisciplinary dashboard approach to evaluate historical and current sustainability performances. The aim is to enhance comprehension of the interconnected dimensions of sustainability and pinpoint management policy priorities. Using 18 indicators, we assessed the environmental, economic and social sustainability performances of European tropical tuna purse seine fleets, comparing them with other industrial tropical tuna fishing fleets in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. The analysis also explored the temporal trend of sustainability performance for European tuna purse seiners from 2009 to 2019. Our results suggest that, compared with gillnetters and longliners, purse seiners and baitboats have a greater species -based selectivity, thereby catching fewer endangered, threatened or protected species, but a lower mature tuna catch rate, thus capturing more juveniles. We identify likely gaps in bycatch data reported by fishing on fish aggregating devices (FADs), due to results regarding selectivity and discard rates that appear inconsistent in the light of the scientific literature. The greater use of FADs, likely caused by the global tuna market, by purse seiner seems result in decreased ecological performances, as suggested by an increased carbon footprint per tonne landed. At the same time, it implies a better economic performance on the short-term, with higher net profit, energy efficiency (fuel consumed relative to monetary value created) and catch. For our case study, Ecology and Economy might seem to be in conflict for short-term perspective. However, consideration of the long-term impacts of FAD fishing and market incentives for fishing on free schools should lead purse seiner fleets to reduce drifting FAD fishing and promote more sustainable fishing practices.

AB  - This study examines municipalities' challenges in digital transformation, focusing on an Icelandic municipality. It aims to determine whether these challenges align with those reported in academic literature, particularly in public service delivery and the sustainability of digital initiatives from an operational perspective. A mixed-methods approach, including interviews with municipal employees and a survey, was used to analyze the municipality's experiences. An evaluation framework introduced by Lafioune et al. guided the analysis. Key findings highlight the importance of senior management support, adequate funding, staff collaboration, and effective data management for making successful and digital transformation sustainable in the long run. Resistance to change, especially among staff, emerged as a significant obstacle to long-term sustainability. The study reveals that the challenges Icelandic municipalities face are consistent with broader research on digital transformation in public administration. The research emphasizes the need for a comprehensive approach integrating technological, organizational, and cultural changes to ensure a sustainable result from these initiatives. It also underscores the potential of digitalization to enhance public service accessibility and efficiency, promoting social cohesion, equity, and long-term sustainability. Practical recommendations include fostering strong leadership, securing strategic funding, and promoting a collaborative culture to ensure the success of digital initiatives in public services.

AB  - The sugarcane expansion in Brazil from 1990 to 2015 increased crop area by 135.1%, which represents more than 10 million hectares. Brazilian ethanol production hit a record high in 2015, reaching 30 billion liters, up 6% compared to 2014. In 2009, the Sugarcane Agroecology-ZAE-CANA-was launched to be a guideline to sustainable sugarcane production in Brazil. However, although it aims at sustainable production, it only considered natural aspects of the country, such as soil and climate. It is still necessary to develop instruments for studies on sustainability in all pillars. The aim of this study is to present the results regarding the application of the FoPIA (Framework for Participatory Impact Assessment) methodology in the Southwestern Goias Planning Region (SGPR). FoPIA is a participatory methodology designed to assess the impacts of land use policies in regional sustainability, and the results showed the capacity of FoPIA to assess the impacts of land use change of the sugarcane expansion in that area. The major advantage of FoPIA is its participatory method feature, as it is possible to join stakeholders to debate and define sustainability guidelines.

AB  - There is lack of understanding of sustainability literacy of real estate practitioners and the extent their literacy level can contribute to sustainability performance in housing delivery in Ghana. This study seeks to assess the sustainability literacy level of real estate practitioners in Ghana and the contribution of their knowledge level to sustainability performance in housing delivery. From extant literature review, 25-item indicator variables from three (3) dimensions of sustainability literacy measurement were identified. This 25-item indicator variable was developed into a questionnaire for a survey on real estate practitioners from the Ghana Real Estate Development Agency. Mean score analysis, weighted score, sensitivity analysis, analysis of variance, item-total correlation analysis, reliability and validity assessments were conducted on the data gathered. The results revealed that real estate practitioners had a generally satisfactory sustainability literacy level across the three dimensions. It further showed that the practitioners have high literacy levels in 11 of the indicator variables across the three dimensions. In the case of the contribution to sustainability performance, a combination of the three dimensions of sustainability literacy suggest a significant contribution to sustainability performance in housing delivery than a single or two dimensions combined. These findings provide insight into sustainability literacy of real estate practitioners and the extent their literacy levels across the three dimensions can contribute to sustainability performance in housing delivery. The findings reinforce the significance of the sustainability knowledge of real estate practitioners in contributing to the success of integration of sustainable concepts in housing delivery to engender sustainability performance in Ghana.

AB  - This review analyzes the effects of economic growth and technological progress on the environment, exploring how modern technology and human behaviors are adapted to minimize environmental impact and promote sustainable development. It examines the role of economic networks and input-output models in understanding intersectoral connections and trade flows, particularly in the context of climate change mitigation and adaptation. Special emphasis is placed on carbon sequestration technologies and carbon accounting methodologies, which are essential for monitoring emissions, assessing carbon footprints, and formulating effective climate policies. Over the past decade, researchers have extensively studied the relationship between economic growth and climate change using various econometric methodologies. The Environmental Kuznets Curve hypothesis suggests that at a certain stage of development, further economic growth can lead to reduced pollution levels. Sector-specific approaches highlight potential solutions for climate change mitigation, emphasizing the need for synergy between technological innovations and human behavior. Carbon sequestration, carbon capture and utilization, and pro-environmental practices play pivotal roles in this transition. By integrating policy support, community engagement, and awareness programs, societies can foster a transformation towards a sustainable future, balancing economic growth with environmental responsibility. This review highlights the intricate relationships between economic systems, technological advancement, and environmental sustainability, offering insights into effective strategies for addressing climate challenges.

AB  - The challenges of achieving just, equitable and sustainable ocean futures require a new type of transdisciplinary and action-oriented science that integrates across disciplines and knowledge systems. Scientists and researchers in academia, industry or government, who contribute to knowledge creation, innovation, and policy development for the ocean, must be empowered with a fresh set of competences. This paper maps the knowledge, skills, and attitudes required to enable such a shift. The proposed skillset serves as a foundation for the design and operationalisation of modern training for ocean sustainability and is envisaged to be used by researchers both individually and in teams. It also highlights the potential for career diversification beyond the traditional 'blue jobs' legitimated by existing sectors. To ensure the short-term practical implementation of the competence framework, self-awareness and self-reflection are encouraged among learners and teachers, along with pragmatic actions to overcome barriers to transdisciplinarity. For long-term impact, system interventions will be necessary to improve organisations' readiness to absorb and valorise researchers trained in this new framework. This will require re-training the current pedagogical workforce as well as reframing existing knowledge systems and incentives.

AB  - Health Impact Assessment (HIA) is a proactive, evidence-based approach that integrates health considerations into decision-making across sectors to prevent adverse effects and promote health equity. While global interest in HIA is growing, its implementation varies by country. In Portugal, despite existing legal frameworks and some previous capacity-building efforts, HIA is not fully institutionalized, and its practice within the Public Health System (PHS) remains largely undocumented. To address this, we conducted an online survey targeting regional and local PHS professionals to assess their awareness, experience, and perceptions of the barriers and facilitators to effective HIA implementation. The results obtained from 187 valid answers gathered from the survey revealed a strikingly low level of HIA awareness and practice within the Portuguese PHS, underscoring the urgent need for improved training and capacity building. Furthermore, the survey identified strong professional interest in HIA initiatives, suggesting significant potential for developing HIA specialized educational programs. Overall, the findings call for stronger political leadership at the governmental level to establish HIA as a key tool for achieving sustainable development goals. Finally, the study emphasizes the potential for international collaboration, particularly with Portuguese-speaking countries, to adapt these insights to their own contexts.

AB  - Community-based conservation and resource management (CBCRM) programs often incorporate the dual goals of poverty alleviation and conservation. However, robust assessments of CBCRM program outcomes are relatively scarce. This study uses a multidisciplinary, systems approach to assess the ecological and social dimensions of success of an internationally acclaimed CBCRM program. This program, located in one of the largest protected areas in the Peruvian Amazon (Pacaya-Samiria National Reserve), strives for the sustainable harvest and trade of a turtle species (Podocnemis unifilis). We used mixed methods analysis, including interviews and population viability modeling, to understand three elements: how local perceptions of changes in the managed population compare to changes inferred by ecological analyses, the indicators stakeholders use to measure success, and the barriers to long-term program success and social-ecological system sustainability. We find that stakeholders perceive a growth trend in the managed turtle population, but this perception may diverge from our ecological understanding of the system under current management. Population viability analyses with a 1:1 sex ratio suggested population size will decline under two of three management scenarios (different degrees of harvest). Yet this and similar studies are plagued by a lack of species- and site-specific population parameters that could improve understanding of the system. Significant vulnerabilities exist for system sustainability, notably the recent decrease in foreign demand for the traded resource. Identifying a sustainable species-specific harvest rate, developing locally-grounded ecological and social indicators, and focusing on data-driven adaptive management will facilitate the identification of key leverage points for future management interventions.

AB  - Benchmarking the performance of cities across aspects that relate to the sustainable development of energy, water and environment systems requires an integrated approach. This paper benchmarks a sample of 12 Southeast European cities based on a composite indicator that consists of 7 dimensions and 35 main indicators. The composite indicator is namely the Sustainable Development of Energy, Water and Environment Systems (SDEWES) City Sustainability Index. The first three dimensions are energy consumption and climate, penetration of energy and carbon dioxide saving measures, and renewable energy potential and utilization. The last four dimensions are water and environmental quality, carbon dioxide emissions and industrial profile, city planning and social welfare, and research, development, innovation, and sustainability policy. The data collection process for the 12 cities integrates data from Sustainable Energy Action Plans and other sources. Data entries are normalized based on the Min-Max method and aggregated for a final ranking. Zagreb, Bucharest (District 1), and Ohrid are the top three cities. An average city receives a composite score of 2.69. Best practices are identified to allow cities to adopt well-rounded efforts to improve future performance. The SDEWES Index is useful to trigger learning, action, and collaboration among cities to transition to a more sustainable future. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The conservation of architectural heritage increasingly focuses on modern functional demands. However, while some existing evaluation frameworks incorporate aspects such as social value, many still emphasize structural preservation and aesthetic restoration, often underrepresenting user-centred sustainability. This study designed a template based on focus group interviews with 16 experts and a literature review. A survey involving 425 residents was conducted to evaluate the functional adaptability of heritage buildings. The findings revealed notable gaps between perceived importance and actual performance. Indicators like Ease of Maintenance and Accessible Design were rated as highly important but performed poorly, while Structural Safety and Fire Safety Systems showed strong performance but lower perceived importance. The results indicate a shift in stakeholder priorities, with operational relevance and inclusivity now outweighing traditional safety concerns. By aligning historical preservation with modern usability, the proposed framework promotes sustainable and inclusive heritage adaptation. It offers actionable insights to integrate stakeholder perspectives into evaluations and inform policy and conservation practices.

AB  - Mountain ecosystems are complex and fragile, with significant topography variations, climatic conditions, and one that faces the most severe threats and challenges due to natural and anthropogenic activities. Despite all contributions within the past few decades on basic concepts, dimensions, sustainability issues, and various aspects of urban sustainability assessment tools, only a few academicians, researchers, and institutions have looked at the peculiar aspects of sustainability in hill areas. However, these have not been implemented or tested for their appropriateness within the context of environmentally sensitive hill areas. This research explores the comparative case study approach for assessing the urban sustainability of hill town using the existing urban sustainability assessment tools (USATs) to address the gap in the available literature. New Tehri Township has been selected as a case for the town's assessment with the selected USATs to determine the key aspects that are not covered by each of the selected USATs. The case-based assessment findings highlighted that not all the criteria and indicators used in a given USATs are relevant in a particular context due to varying environmental, social, and economic conditions. The results provide valuable information and evidence to planners, developers, and researchers for further studies on township-level sustainability analysis, as well as emphasizing the importance of collaborative efforts and a well-defined mechanism in achieving humane, sustainable, and environment-friendly settlements.

AB  - While soils and land are pivotal elements of many Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and societal challenges, they face degradation and reduction of related functions and services worldwide. Societal demands on soils and land are increasing, including contributions to climate change mitigation and adaptation, ecosystem services, biodiversity and biomass production for food, feed, fiber and energy. This adverse combination of reducing capacities and increas-ing demands requires rapid transition towards sustainable soil and land management that mitigates trade-offs and cre-ates synergies. Likewise, a transformation of soil and land research is required to scientifically support the sustainable transformation. Based on a literature analysis combined with engagement of soil and land scientists, we developed a systemic research framework for sustainable soil and land management to support the implementation of the Horizon Europe Mission "A Soil Deal for Europe". The framework summarizes soil and land related topics into six societal challenges and associates them with eight knowledge types that outline integrated research for development and implementation of sustainable soil and land management. We propose that research should be aligned with living labs and lighthouses to leverage local solutions, innovation, training and education. We outline the role of experimentation, data analysis, assessment, modelling and the importance of research for institutions, governance and policy support. For encouraging a swift tran-sition towards a systems approach for sustainable soil and land management, we concluded that among all knowledge types, those addressing socio-economic interrelations with soil health and related policies currently represent the big-gest bottleneck.

AB  - Recreational spearfishing is a fishing method that occurs globally, yet receives considerably less attention in the scientific literature relative to other recreational fishing methods, such as angling. Lack of scientific information on spearfishing may negatively affect the development and management of marine recreational fisheries. We conducted a systematic review of 102 peer-reviewed papers published between 1967 and 2022 pertaining to marine recreational spearfishing. Based on this literature review, we provide an overview of key insights across social, economic, and ecological dimensions of marine recreational spearfishing. While spearfishers represent less than 5% of marine recreational fishers, the participants are younger and may differ from recreational anglers in their motivations, with suggestions of increased well-being generated from a close connection with the sea during underwater fishing. Recreational spearfishers mostly target species of moderate to high levels of vulnerability that are mid to high trophic level carnivores. Though spearfishers can deliberately target larger individuals of exploited populations, this is not a generalizable pattern. Despite a growing body of research on the ecological impacts of marine recreational spearfishing, there is limited knowledge of these effects and their mechanisms across biological levels of organization (e.g., individual, population, community and ecosystem) compared with those of other fishing methods. Recreational spearfishers can contribute to advances in marine ecological knowledge, and inclusive participatory management could represent a key step towards transformative sustainable development of marine recreational spearfishing. Throughout the review, we identify gaps in the research and areas where future research is needed to better inform the socio-economic importance, ecosystem impacts and future management of marine recreational spearfishing.

AB  - The SDGS repeatedly emphasizes the importance of reducing greenhouse gas emissions such as carbon dioxide. The strategic utilization of straw resources to curtail open-air burning not only epitomizes optimal resource deployment but also constitutes a significant stride in environmental preservation and sustainable development. Globally, the imperative of this challenge is increasingly recognized, prompting nations to enhance straw resource utilization technologies, devise regional management strategies, and extend requisite policy support. Regional straw utilization encapsulates a comprehensive concept involving an array of stakeholders including governments, farmers, corporations, brokers, and rural cooperatives, with each one of these uniquely contributing to a multifaceted network that is influenced by their respective resource utilization intentions. This heterogeneity, coupled with the diverse roles of these stakeholders, renders the identification of the pivotal participants and their specific functions within the intricate network. To navigate this complexity, this study employed text analysis and social network analysis, uncovering 30 robust associative rules within this domain. Our findings elucidate that the stakeholder network in regional straw resource utilization exhibits characteristics akin to the NW small-world network model. The key network entities identified include farmers, corporations, governments, and rural cooperatives. Furthermore, the study systematically categorizes the principal entities and elucidates the dynamics of this multi-stakeholder network. This research delineates four developmental models that are pertinent to regional straw resource utilization, which is a framework that is instrumental in pinpointing the accountable parties and optimizing the overarching benefits derived from these resources. The significance of this research lies not only in showcasing the potential of straw resources for environmental conservation but also in underscoring the importance of collaborative strategies and network optimization in order to achieve sustainable development goals.

AB  - This study examined the knowledge of Collaborative Adaptive Stewardship (CASt) to advance Invasive Alien Plants (IAPs) management in South Africa. This concept promotes the involvement of private landowners and other stakeholders in the management and action processes, hence promoting social inclusivity, job creation, and sustainable biodiversity stewardship. It demonstrates that landowners are major stakeholders in IAPs management, thereby practising biodiversity stewardship in the 80% of privately owned lands of the country. The involvement of landowners in the management process aids in the prevention of further expansion of IAPs, the mitigation of risks (such as fire and flooding), and the maintenance of ecosystem functionality and landscape-scale connectivity. CASt fosters synergy among many stakeholders for the management of IAPs and long-term sustainable biodiversity stewardship. In South Africa, a number of landowners have entered into stewardship agreements as a result of incentives and subsidies for IAPs management. The benefits should be contingent on private landowner actions to IAPs management; this will support biodiversity stewardship. This study serves as a foundation for collaborative IAPs management and will be crucial in achieving long-term sustainability goals (e.g., economy, society and environment) to protect biodiversity and ecosystem services.

AB  - Purpose This study aims to investigate how transformative learning has been conceptualised and operationalised in education for sustainable development (ESD) and sustainability learning and to collect evidence on how to support transformative learning in formal and non-formal environments. Design/methodology/approach The authors conducted a systematic literature review to provide a structured and replicable search and analysis of the relevant literature to produce a bibliometric overview that combines a quantitative description of the body of literature and qualitative analysis of the learning processes, outcomes and conditions. Findings The convergence between transformative learning and sustainability has become an emerging field of inquiry, despite the superficial use of transformative learning theory in many studies. By examining the learning process, outcomes and conditions in the core sample of studies, this study demonstrates that transformative learning theory - if carefully studied - can contribute to the design and implementation of educational interventions and assessments of learning towards sustainability. Furthermore, the sustainability context provides an empirical grounding that highlights the fact that social learning, the role of experience and the development of sustainability competencies are inherently part of transformative learning. Originality/value To date, few attempts have been made to better understand how transformative learning theory has been used in sustainability learning and ESD research. This systematic review allows for a better comprehension of how concepts and mechanisms elucidated in transformative learning theory are operationalised in sustainability learning and ESD research and serves as a source of inspiration for those researchers and practitioners who aims to make sustainability education, teaching and learning more transformative.

AB  - The purpose of materiality assessment in sustainability reporting is to identify, select and prioritize the issues that have the most significance to companies and their stakeholders. Reporting on the material aspects of sustainability provides greater transparency for the stakeholders and achieves greater accountability for the company. To date, few studies have inquired into quantitative methods to support materiality assessment in sustainability reporting, and these have not addressed the issues of subjectivity or of completeness in the reporting. To respond to this gap in the literature we propose a 'fuzzy analytic hierarchy process' method. This method facilitates sustainability reporting by means of a structured materiality analysis based on the Global Reporting Initiative Guidelines. The outcome of the proposed method is a prioritization of sustainability aspects and indicators, which offers a guide to companies in identifying the appropriate content for preparation of their reports. Each GRI aspect and indicator can be reported with a level of accuracy corresponding to its level of importance (materiality). In addition, the method allows the company managers to identify a threshold of completeness below which sustain ability aspects and indicators can be reported in only summary form, as not being substantially material. The ex-ante choice of a level of completeness is particularly important for companies with limited resources to dedicate to reporting activities, as is typical for small and medium enterprises. As they address the reporting task, companies can use the proposed method to assess materiality, thus enhancing the credibility and accountability of the sustainability reports while containing costs in time and resources. The paper illustrates the method through a step-by-step application to a medium-sized Italian company active in the water technology sector. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The continuing HIV pandemic calls for broad, multi-sectoral responses that foster community control of local prevention and care services, with the goal of leveraging high quality treatment as a means of reducing HIV incidence. Service system improvements require stakeholder input from across the care continuum to identify gaps and to inform strategic plans that improve HIV service integration and delivery. System dynamics modeling offers a participatory research approach through which stakeholders learn about system complexity and about ways to achieve sustainable system-level improvements. Via an intensive group model building process with a task force of community stakeholders with diverse roles and responsibilities for HIV service implementation, delivery and surveillance, we designed and validated a multi-module system dynamics model of the HIV care continuum, in relation to local prevention and care service capacities. Multiple sources of data were used to calibrate the model for a three-county catchment area of central Connecticut. We feature a core module of the model for the purpose of illustrating its utility in understanding the dynamics of treatment as prevention at the community level. We also describe the methods used to validate the model and support its underlying assumptions to improve confidence in its use by stakeholders for systems understanding and decision making. The model's generalizability and implications of using it for future community-driven strategic planning and implementation efforts are discussed.

AB  - It is very important to adopt innovative digital technologies in educational systems to overcome the challenges in modern learning environments, especially in the post-COVID-19 era. The fourth Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of the 2030 Agenda is supported by new educational trends that consider game-based learning as a pedagogical method in the classroom. Teaching sustainability management in higher education institutions with innovative digital tools plays a fundamental role in the transition toward sustainable societies. Suitable game design elements play a significant role in facilitating sustainable learning. This study explored the effectiveness of incorporating business simulation games with project-based learning (PBL) in a flipped classroom setting. This approach was adopted within the context of a university cross-border e-commerce course to prepare students for acquiring 21st-century skills such as higher-order thinking skills in a rapidly changing educational landscape. A quasi-experimental method was employed, involving a total of 60 university students from China's Zhejiang Province. Participants completed an online questionnaire designed to assess their learning engagement across three dimensions (cognitive, emotional, and behavioral) as well as their higher-order thinking skills (problem-solving, critical thinking, and creativity). The results show that the business simulation games combined with flipped classroom learning had a significantly positive impact on students' learning outcomes, enhancing their problem-solving, critical thinking, and creative capabilities. Importantly, this approach also improved student engagement and promoted sustainable practices by applying real-life scenarios in an interactive environment. We conclude that business simulation games integrated with project-based learning (PBL) in flipped classroom settings represent a valuable educational approach. This approach not only enhances learning engagement but also fosters the development of higher-order thinking skills, encouraging students to adopt sustainable learning practices.

AB  - Labor law is traditionally viewed as a crucial mechanism for advancing gender equality in the workplace by providing a framework to eliminate sex-based discrimination and enhance women's participation in the workforce. As nations strive to achieve the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the significance of such laws is amplified, with gender equality not only a key indicator but also an enabler for other SDGs. This study demonstrates that, despite recent reforms in Vietnam's labour law reducing barriers to female employment, pervasive gender inequality persists, fuelled by enduring employment stereotypes that often depict women as victims. To develop a sustainable workforce, Vietnam's labor laws and policies should implement strategies to dismantle these stereotypes. This research suggests transitioning from the traditional approach of female protection to involving men in domestic roles. A strategy targeting men is expected to promote gender equality in the Vietnamese workforce by altering employer perceptions of female employees' maternal roles. From the perspective of masculinity theory, the potential of paternity bonuses is significant; they can enhance women's career opportunities by alleviating domestic burdens and broadening acceptable roles for men.

AB  - Agricultural carbon emissions pose a significant challenge in combating climate change and achieving sustainable development objectives. These emissions predominantly stem from the decisions made by stakeholders, and the potential economic and social benefits associated with agricultural product brands determine their capacity to influence stakeholder behavior. This study utilizes panel data from 30 provinces in China spanning from 2008 to 2021 to examine the impact of agricultural product brands on agricultural carbon emission intensity and its underlying mechanisms. The findings indicate that: (1) Agricultural product brands contribute to lowering agricultural carbon emission intensity within a region, while also exerting a negative spillover effect on neighboring areas. (2) Agricultural product brands foster a decline in agricultural carbon emission intensity by bolstering the agricultural industry agglomeration. (3) Agricultural scale operation exhibits a threshold effect between agricultural product brands and agricultural carbon emission intensity, with the mitigation effect becoming increasingly pronounced as the threshold range expands. The research findings can offer valuable insights into leveraging the advantages of agricultural product brands to facilitate the reduction of agricultural carbon emissions.

AB  - A strategy supporting the development towards a circular economy is industrial symbiosis (IS). It is a form of collaborative supply chain management aiming to make industry more sustainable and achieve collective benefits based on utilization of waste, by-products, and excess utilities between economically independent industries. Based on an extensive analysis of published studies on existing IS collaborations and interviews with central stakeholders of a comprehensive IS, this paper investigates IS from a supply chain collaboration perspective. A theoretical framework is built and used to discuss how industrial symbiosis pursues sustainability and to identify the main collaboration aspects and performance impacts. This framework is then used in the analysis of selected published cases. Based on this, we derive propositions on the organizational and operational requirements for collaboration in the context of IS networks, related to the supply chain integration and coordination practices. As IS has only received little attention in the operations and supply chain management community, our propositions directly lead to future research directions. Furthermore, the analysis in this paper provides directions to increase the feasibility and resource efficiency of IS networks and can hence be used by stakeholders involved in these networks.

AB  - City branding is becoming more and more popular, not only as a field of research, but also as a practice of local governments. Municipalities attempt to introduce this concept into their sustainable transformation process, positioning a city among its stakeholders as, for instance, an eco-oriented, innovative, or smart city. An idea that fosters building a strong and consistent city brand is brand personality. The aim of the paper is to diagnose a city's brand personality dimensions/traits communicated via posts published on official Facebook accounts of cities and to identify differences occurring within this scope between cities of two selected Central and Eastern European countries-Poland and Ukraine. To achieve this aim, the research involved a content analysis of 1700 posts published by 34 municipalities representing regional capital cities of Poland and Ukraine. On the basis of these study results, the authors have supplemented the Aaker (1997) five-dimensional scale of brand personality with the sixth dimension: Prosocial Attitude, which includes cooperative and bureaucratic traits, to better comply with the approach of cities to problems of their inhabitants and their surrounding environment, which is consistent with the idea of sustainability. Furthermore, the fifth trait has been added to characteristics which make up Aaker's Excitement dimension. Dubbed as patriotic, it refers to the city's activities related to the local celebration of historical events, indicating national pride and identification with its place of residence. Bureaucratic and patriotic traits were quite frequently observed in posts published on the official Facebook accounts of Ukrainian cities. Moreover, the research proves that in case of Polish cities the dominating brand personality dimensions are Sincerity and Excitement. Ukrainian cities tend to exercise communication based on the Sincerity and Competence dimension.

AB  - The surge in intrastate conflicts has prompted a paradigm shift in the United Nations (U.N.) peace processes, expanding its primary focus on maintaining international peace to encompass peacekeeping and peacebuilding efforts within intrastate disputes, particularly in the post-Cold War era. While numerous human rights frameworks have been acknowledged as integral to peace initiatives, socio-economic rights remain comparatively underemphasized. This article aims to emphasize the need for greater attention to social and economic rights within the United Nations' peacekeeping operations in Africa, particularly in the context of Disarmament, Demobilization, and Reintegration (DDR) programmes in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Sierra Leone, where large-scale DDR programmes were implemented. While acknowledging the significance of other human rights in the peace process, this article contends that social rights play a pivotal role in facilitating DDR, as well as the broader framework of United Nations peacekeeping operations. It underscores that addressing the socio-economic rights in the implementation of DDR is instrumental in achieving sustainable peace. The paper calls upon institutions, UN peacekeeping and peacebuilding stakeholders, policymakers, to prioritize social and economic rights for effective DDR and a more enduring peace outcome.

AB  - When firms want to meet ambitious sustainability targets, they often fail to deliver on more radical innovation at the level of the business model. They often struggle to design and successfully implement new, sustainable business models in practice. While sustainability tools might help bridge the design-implementation gap in business, they often lack a grounding in both theory and practice. In this study, we build on empirical research that recognises the importance of dynamic capabilities to develop sustainable business models, and the barriers and drivers that might exist at the organizational level. We investigate the following research question: How can firms address organizational design issues in order to develop the dynamic capabilities necessary for sustainable business model innovation? The research method consists of four stages derived from the iterative, user-involved method of design science research: 1) identifying the problem and defining objectives for a solution; 2) design and development; 3) demonstration; and 4) evaluation. The work results in the "Sustainable By Design" tool which was used in a workshop setting with two large multinational companies seen as sustainability leaders in their sectors: DSM and IKEA Retail (Ingka Group). The work makes two contributions. First, we contribute the Sustainable By Design tool which practitioners can use to evaluate their current organizational design, identify barriers and drivers for sustainable business model innovation, and develop strategic interventions to engage in organizational transformation. Second, we elucidate the theoretical connections between organizational design, dynamic capabilities, and sustainable business model innovation, and suggest directions for future research.

AB  - Higher education institutions (HEIs) are not insulated from the challenges facing the planet and have been tasked as key stakeholders in sustainable development (SD). The preliminary data presented in this paper demonstrate that, over the last five decades, there has been a shift toward the categories of SD work that necessitate a collaborative culture that is not traditionally inherent in HEIs. It is offered that when HEIs align their institutional capacities with worldwide efforts to achieve sustainable development goals (SDGs) by 2030 and foster an intentionally collaborative culture, they will become better equipped to face their own unique challenges: becoming "changemaker" universities; collaborating with each other in the knowledge economy; placing students at the center of the teaching and learning process; and fulfilling their "third mission" to partner with external stakeholders and society. This paper will outline the conceptual frameworks used to direct the construction of Wingate University's Collaborative for the Common Good (CCG). The preliminary data from this case study at Wingate University show promise; tracked impact reports show that an intentionally collaborative infrastructure that is designed to contribute to achieving SDGs provided a unique opportunity for this university to meet the needs of the campus and community despite their many social, economic, and cultural challenges that were exacerbated by COVID-19.

AB  - The vision of the Physical Internet (PI) involves both sharing logistics resources and information exchange within an open network. The implementation of PI is seen as a promising contribution toward sustainable logistics. This paper investigates motives for and success factors in collaborating in a PI network. We apply an interpretive case-based research approach involving four shippers and three logistics service providers (LSPs) that operate in a PI network. Motives are defined as the reasons that encourage an organization to enter the PI network. Success factors are conditions required for organizations to continue collaborating in a PI network. This is the first PI study conducted in a multi-industry context. The findings demonstrate the central and neutral orchestration of resources (i.e., physical, digital/intangible, and relational resources) as a substantial and multi-faceted issue in PI and continuous PI collaboration. A well-accepted theory (Resource-Based View) and its most recent extension (Resource Orchestration Theory-ROT) frame and guide our research. ROT informs the deployment of physical, digital/intangible, and relational resources by a neutral orchestrator in a PI network. The knowledge of motives and success factors allows the development of future user-oriented PI services that are likely to be accepted by shippers and LSPs.

AB  - This article stems from a research project in five early childhood development (ECD) centres in South Africa, and focuses on parent-practitioner collaboration for sustainable development in early years education. Using a qualitative approach, we followed a participatory action learning and action research (PALAR) design to answer the main research question: "How can parent-practitioner collaboration support education for sustainable development in the early years?" Participants formed an action learning set (ALS) in which they acted as co-researchers and equal partners to construct their own meanings in order to advocate for social change. Data were collected in the ALS during Cycle 3 of the PALAR process. We relied on transcribed, recorded ALS discussions and photovoice activities to generate data, and used thematic content analysis to collaboratively analyse the data. Our findings disclose that education for sustainable development is possible when parents and practitioners collaborate.

AB  - Lean Manufacturing (LM) has traditionally helped industries in removing the non-value-added processes to achieve operational excellence. Similarly, the blue ocean strategy helps organizations in creating an uncontested market space where the competition is irrelevant. The authors posit that the integration of two approaches helps in achieving holistic manufacturing excellence, and there is a paucity of approaches that integrate the two paradigms. In order to fill this research gap, the authors have developed an integrated framework that combines the concepts of lean manufacturing and blue ocean manufacturing (BOM), via a structured survey. Using the lean tool of value stream mapping and four-action framework of BOM, the framework was duly implemented on the selected case study and reductions in lead-time and value-added time were recorded to be 26% and 39% respectively. In addition to that, more than 50% reduction in the environmentally detrimental GHG emissions was recorded through the implementation of the integrated framework. The novelty of the research work lies in the amalgamation of lean manufacturing and Blue Ocean manufacturing, concomitant to which economic and environmental sustainability can be achieved. The framework provides clarity to practitioners and academicians regarding the implementation of two approaches (LM and BOM) in a harmonious manner to attain reduction in non-value added activities and delivery times which attains market leadership through high-quality product manufacturing with lower production time and costs. This economic lever is capable of delivering economic sustainability and implicates improved environmental performance through reduced energy consumption. In future, research work can be carried out using the innovative concepts of Industry 4.0 with lean and sustainable manufacturing. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Regional sustainability networks in the Netherlands are rooted in regional culture and have an emphasis on social learning and effective collaboration between multiple actors. The national Duurzaam Door' (Moving Forward Sustainably) Policy Programme regards these networks as generative governance arrangements where new knowledge, actions and relations can co-evolve together with new insights in governance and learning within sustainability transitions. In order to understand the dynamics of the learning in these networks we have monitored emergent properties of social learning between 2014 and 2016. Our focus is particularly on the interrelated role of trust, commitment, reframing and reflexivity. Our aim is to better understand the role and the dynamics of these emergent properties and to see which actors and roles can foster the effectiveness of social learning in regional transitions towards more sustainable ways of living. We used a retrospective analysis with Reflexive Monitoring in Action (RMA), which we combined with the Most Significant Change approach. We found that reflexivity in particular is a critical property at moments that can make or break the process.

AB  - Orienting societies towards sustainability requires comprehensive learning of how to think, act and live within a safe and just space for humanity. Approaching sustainability as a core paradigm of quality education in the twenty-first century, Education for Sustainable Development necessitates an integrated view on learning. For educational organizations, Whole Institution Approaches (WIAs) to sustainability emphasize that all learning is embedded within its socio-physical contexts. Although the core objective-to "walk the talk" on sustainability-is theoretically well established, questions remain regarding its specific conceptualizations. Based on a systematic qualitative analysis of 104 international documents from scientific and grey literature, this article offers a conceptual synthesis of the core elements of WIAs to sustainability in education. Based on the literature analysis, WIAs are described as continuous and participative organizational learning processes aimed at institutional coherence on sustainability, consistently linking the formal and informal (hidden) curricula. While specific pathways are necessary for diverse organizations, the article synthesizes a joint framework. Key characteristics of WIAs are clustered within five core principles (coherence, continuous learning, participation, responsibility, long-term commitment), seven highly integrated areas of action (governance, curriculum, campus, community, research, communication, capacity building), the underlying organizational culture, and critical conditions for successful implementation. As becomes clear from the synthesis, following a WIA means to collaboratively switch the default mode of all rules-in-use to sustainability. The concept of WIAs may thus both be approached as an instrument for consistent organizational development in light of (un-)sustainability and as a keystone of integrated high-quality sustainability learning.

AB  - The article investigates the possibilities of re-activating the built heritage of the Marche Apennine through shared, creative, and transcalar approaches. This is a particularly challenging task for marginal inner areas, which during the pandemic have been even more isolated due to previous structural issues such as lack of services, poor accessibility, economic stagnation, and depopulation. Italian inner areas are also facing an increase in environmental risks linked to ongoing climate change. This work focuses on the Appennino Basso Pesarese Anconetano in the Marche Region as part of the national project "Branding4Resilience". The research methodological approach entails an exploration of the territory through quantitative and qualitative tools to investigate the possibility of a new reading of the Marche inner area and suggest operation at a local level, without losing the wider perspective on global challenges. This interpretation is synthesized in a territorial portrait that supports visions for the sustainable transformation of the area, and shows the need for shared collaborative approaches for more inclusive forms of living together. Finally, the work proposes built heritage as a trigger for development processes in marginalized territories, thus highlighting the crucial role of design and creativity, through transcalar approaches, to unveil relevant and often hidden resources and to envisage resilient futures for inner areas.

AB  - Over the past 20 years, standards and certification have become the leading governance mechanism for determining what sustainability entails, how to measure it, and how to assess it. This system of sustainability standards has generally relied upon the third-party certification (TPC) model to ensure that producers are complying with standards. Over the past ten to fifteen years, critiques of this model have emerged in both practitioner and academic circles that question the appropriateness of this model based on the type of knowledge that is privileged, the marginalisation of some actors, and the allocation of accountability to individual rather than collective actors. We draw upon case studies from Japan and Chile to examine the ways that participatory guarantee systems (PGS) institute practices for defining, measuring, and assessing sustainability that empower local actors - both producers and consumers. Our cases illustrate that expert and lay knowledges are both relevant and often have different strengths. We argue that PGS offer an alternative approach to sustainability governance, one that may be more democratic and hence, produce forms of sustainability that incorporate the lived experiences of people around the world.

AB  - This study addresses the critical need to report original and current findings on the global food system's ability to meet the growing natural resource demands of an estimated 9 billion global population. The objective is to provide guidance for researchers in developing strategies to reduce climate change risks in the food and beverage supply. To achieve this, we propose integrating innovative industry insights and digital applications into existing food system models as industrial demonstrators. Our research encompasses six impactful themes, demonstrating effective delivery methodologies. We highlight that human-centred activities and practices, often overlooked in sustainability assessments, hinder improved security and sustainability in the food system. Through our work, we showcase how smarter food production processes, along with active citizen engagement, can achieve desired outcomes outlined in frameworks, such as the Sustainable Development Goals. A crucial aspect is the development of Internet of Things (IoT) platforms, integrating workforce practices into manufacturing activities, and driving the necessary cultural changes for a sustainable food system. This study illuminates challenges faced by the global food system and provides actionable insights and methodologies to guide researchers and industry stakeholders in creating a more sustainable and secure future for food production and consumption.

AB  - This paper seeks to provide insights into the sustainability report assurance process by exploring how reporting firms and assurance providers work together to produce high-quality and credible assurance outcomes. In this literature review, the assurance process is conceptualised as a systematic procedure that incorporates the detail of assurance work along with associated barriers and ethical issues. Based on a review of 87 identified papers on this topic covering 2003-2021, this paper develops a conceptual framework of the assurance process by dividing it into five steps-assurance provider selection, identification, screening, validation and evaluation-and then explains the logic underlying these steps by synthesising the findings from the identified papers. Furthermore, barriers that impede the adoption of and issues that constrain the benefits of sustainability assurance are also identified, such as the absence of stakeholder engagement or independence of the assurance provider. Overall, this paper focuses on the assurance process for sustainability reports, contributing to the conceptual development of sustainability reporting and providing a comprehensive framework for future study in this emerging field. In addition, this paper also provides both assurance providers and reporting firms with a detailed roadmap for decision-making regarding sustainability assurance.

AB  - This study investigates the factors driving micro, small, and medium enterprise (MSME) empowerment, tourism development, and sustainable tourism villages, focusing on Ponggok Tourism Village as a case study. The purpose is to address gaps in understanding how leadership, innovation, governance, collaboration, capacity building, and technology contribute to empowering MSMEs and achieving sustainability in rural tourism contexts. Using a mixed-methods approach, the study combines quantitative analysis of survey data and thematic analysis of interviews with MSME actors, facilitators, and local government officials. Key findings reveal that leadership and innovation are critical drivers of MSME empowerment, with technology in service quality significantly impacting tourism development. However, technology in governance and transparency shows limited direct influence on tourism, emphasizing the need for better alignment with tourism strategies. Additionally, MSME empowerment strongly influences both tourism development and the sustainability of tourism villages, creating a mutually reinforcing relationship. This study provides a novel framework for integrating leadership, technological advancements, and governance improvements with local tourism strategies. By highlighting Ponggok's village potential as a model, the findings offer practical insights for policymakers and practitioners seeking to enhance rural tourism through MSME empowerment. Future research could explore scaling this framework to other contexts and refining technological tools for governance in tourism.

AB  - Regulatory experiments (RegExs) can be considered an element of mission -oriented innovation policies. As such, we discuss how they relate to real -world labs (RwLs) and how they can contribute to sustainability transformations. We distinguish between two types of experiments: 1. regulatory sandboxes that help innovators to bring new products, services, and other innovations to market, and 2. regulatory -innovation experiments that are specifically designed to explore new solutions for evolving regulatory frameworks. The two types can be linked to RwLs such that an RwL can be embedded in a regulatory sandbox, enabling the RwL to try out solutions that would not be feasible without the sandbox, given the regulatory framework in place. Alternatively, the various experiments in the RwL are complemented by one or several regulatoryinnovation experiments. RegExs, as a form of experimental policy engagement, are an important addition to RwL concepts in a sustainability transformation context. They contribute to both innovative sustainability solutions as well as regulatory learning and testing of regulatory innovations. By applying the programme theory approach and developing a Theory of Change for RegEx, we discuss their potential impact on sustainability trans formations in terms of the directionality and the acceleration of change, based on examples from the energy sector.

AB  - Project sustainability is a concern for community development practitioners. An aspect of communi-ty development is sustainability which implies that benefits derived from executed projects are main-tained and continue as long as the project exists. The strong commitment of the local people, lead-ership and other local resources are needed to re-suscitate executed projects in the community. This study explores strategies for promoting the sustain -ability of community development projects in South-east Nigeria. The study adopted cluster and purposive sam-pling techniques. A total of eight communities from four Local Government Areas (LGAs) from two states in Southeast Nigeria were sampled for the study. The Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) and in-depth interviews (IDIs) served as data collection instruments. The study sample size comprised 88 participants. The information produced for the re-search was analyzed thematically. Findings showed that while the numerous com-munity development projects in the study areas can account for some developmental interest, they also created opportunities for neglect. To promote the sustainability of community development projects, a holistic approach is crucial and interventions must be indigenous and people-oriented. Also, social workers need to create dialogue forums with com-munity members to help attain the goal of project sustainability.

AB  - While transdisciplinary (TD) research is desired in order to solve real world sustainability issues, this may be challenging for both academic and non-academic participants. Supporting learning through evaluation, we analyzed a project aiming at sustainable transport infrastructures. After developing a TD research framework as a benchmark, two external independent evaluators interviewed all project researchers, representatives for end-users, and donors. The evaluators compared results with the framework, and evaluators and participants critically reflected on the results together. There were three inconsistencies relative to the framework: (1) limited understanding of TD research among project management, end-users, and most of the researchers; (2) no structured learning process among end-users; instead, they expressed very diverse opinions about what they expected from the project; (3) project leaders had limited understanding of the special challenges of TD research, did not fully understand the status of the project's social system, and thus did not act as facilitators of the required collaborative learning process. Non-academic participants saw themselves as customers and not as partners in the knowledge production process. We conclude that TD problem-solving research requires much time and needs facilitation and training. A preparatory phase with a lower level of funding would be helpful in preparing for TD processes.

AB  - Our existential sustainability challenges involve human-environment-technology systems that are complex, dynamic and tightly coupled. But at Universities, knowledge, in teaching and research, is mostly organized into discrete parcels, the disciplines. These are further divided into the categories of natural sciences, social science and the humanities. This paper addresses the question of how in their training of researchers, universities can equip them to better understand their roles and also to act as change agents. It describes a doctoral school course in transferable skills that is offered across faculties. The unique aim of the course is to provide a space for reflection on different research paradigms and the way they differ in their framing the role of a scientific researcher in pluralist societies that face existential challenges. The pedagogical framework and approach of the course encourages questioning one's own ontological and epistemological assumptions about the constitution of our world and how we might better understand it in dialogues with participants who come from diverse disciplinary backgrounds. The course includes discussions of: what is a discipline, and how disciplines differ in their understandings of the world and of the role of science within it; how tools and representations can shape or breach disciplinary paradigms; how instrumental science and interdisciplinarity can raise the dilemma of rigor or relevance; how complexity, contradictions and values are embraced in responsible research design, and last but not least we discuss the relation of science, progress and open futures. The course introduces diverse more recent approaches to scientific inquiry that harness the potential of democratizing science in our networked knowledge society, including critical interdisciplinarity, post-normal science, citizen science and transformative sustainability science, that complement normal disciplinary research practices.

AB  - This article aims to substantiate the factors by which the oil industry influences the sustainable development of OPEC++-participating countries under conditions of uncertainty. The impact of the price parameters of the world oil market and the tools of its regulation on the sustainability of OPEC++-participating countries was assessed using panel regression analysis. The sustainable development level of OPEC++-participating countries was analyzed by the integrated estimation method, focusing on crude oil market functioning features. Undoubtedly, we can testify that there is a direct correlation between the country's level of socio-economic development and sustainable development. In resource economies, a reduction in oil production and exports cannot have the same effect on sustainable development as in countries that do not produce oil, or are characterized by a higher level of economic development. With an appropriate level of economic diversification and the effectiveness of the institutional framework for managing the oil market, sustainable development can be achieved. Based on the model of the integrated assessment of the sustainable development of oil-exporting countries, the impact of statistically significant financial investors' panic factor on the imbalance of oil prices due to the uncertainty of economic development was determined. Key indicators that create a panic factor in the oil market were identified. These include the indicators of the number of countries enforcing lockdown and the pandemic's duration. We argue for the need to develop an effective strategy for achieving the sustainable development goals (SDGs) in OPEC++-participating countries, based on the management of crude oil supply and demand forces and by considering the effect of financial investors' panic factor on the oil market.

AB  - BackgroundParticipation of health service staff in research improves health outcomes and adherence to clinical guidelines. To increase research participation, many health services seek to build research capacity which adds to the development of individual and organisational skills and abilities in order to conduct health research. Numerous approaches to research capacity building have been trialed with inter- and intra-institutional, or university-health service collaborative approaches being frequently described strategies. University-health service research collaborations have potential for high impact and mutual benefit, by harnessing respective strengths across both organisations. However, the range and scope of research capacity building approaches, including their relative value and success have not been consolidated. The aim of this review was to examine and describe the collaborative strategies employed by health services in conjunction with educational partners to enhance the research capability of health service staff.MethodsThe scoping review framework by Arksey and O'Malley was used to inform the review method. A systematic search was conducted of four major databases: Medline, CINAHL, Embase, and Cochrane, focusing on publications after 1995. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were established through iterative team discussions. The two-stage screening process and data extraction was managed in Covidence. Collaboration, Research Capacity, Health Services, and Health workforce were the primary concepts, contexts and populations guiding the search.ResultsOf the 1462 studies identified, 61 were selected for the review. These studies reported on partnerships between universities and health services with a specific focus on building research capacity of health service staff. Studies predominantly hailed from Australia, USA, UK, and Canada. Collaboration approaches varied and leveraged different activities to build research capacity included training, mentoring, shared funding, and networking. Training partnerships emerging as the most prevalent. Findings emphasised the importance of localisation in approaches, with some studies indicating the intrinsic value of such collaborations for both partners involved. Despite the emphasis on individual interventions like training and mentoring, team-level interventions were notably scarce.ConclusionThis review highlights the diverse range of approaches in research capacity building collaborations between health services and educational partners. It advocates for a shared understanding of goals, highlighting the critical nature of relationship-building and the pivotal role of sustainable infrastructure in long-term collaboration success. Future directions should consider the tangible impacts of these models on clinical outcomes.

AB  - Growth in sustainability reporting and disclosure by corporations have led to questions about how representative such information is of the real environmental performance of firms. There is doubt about whether disclosure has any effect on management and operational practice. Some scholars suggest sustainability claims are exaggerated or inaccurate, leading to broader concern about a phenomenon called greenwashing. This causes uncertainty among stakeholders about the impact firms have on the environment, and what they are doing about mitigating impacts and capitalising on opportunities. This paper explores disclosures and environmental impact mitigation practices across the Australian construction and demolition (C&D) waste ecosystem. It uses a combination of practitioner interviews and longitudinal analysis, evaluating financial reports and sustainability disclosures to explore the connection between disclosure practice and environmental innovation. It reveals that, if the purpose of innovation is to confer a competitive advantage, sometimes known as strategic corporate social responsibility (CSR), there is an incentive for firms to limit external distribution of such information. The paper therefore provides a new and interesting insight into the behaviour of firms. Whereas previously, concerns over greenwashing suggest that firms exaggerate sustainability performance, this paper reports evidence that much innovation remains confidential. If, as the Port Hypothesis would suggest, firms are innovating in response to higher environmental standards, there is a natural incentive to delay external communication until new products can be sold in the marketplace. There are implications for policymakers considering if and how to regulate sustainability disclosure, and for managers seeking to improve sustainability communication with stakeholders.

AB  - Increasing number of smart cities, the rise of technology and urban population engagement in urban management, and the scarcity of open data for evaluating sustainable urban development determines the necessity of developing new sustainability assessment approaches. This study uses passive crowdsourcing together with the adapted SULPiTER (Sustainable Urban Logistics Planning to Enhance Regional freight transport) methodology to assess the sustainable development of smart cities. The proposed methodology considers economic, environmental, social, transport, communication factors and residents' satisfaction with the urban environment. The SULPiTER relies on experts in selection of relevant factors and determining their contribution to the value of a sustainability indicator. We propose an alternative approach based on automated data gathering and processing. To implement it, we build an information service around a formal knowledge base that accumulates alternative workflows for estimation of indicators and allows for automatic comparison of alternatives and aggregation of their results. A system architecture was proposed and implemented with the Astana Opinion Mining service as its part that can be adjusted to collect opinions in various impact areas. The findings hold value for early identification of problems, and increasing planning and policies efficiency in sustainable urban development.

LA  - English
AB  - This study attempts to formulate a conceptual and operational model that encapsulates the highlights of scientific sustainability research and that identifies the critical success factors of sustainable development from the perspective of different stakeholder groups. It seeks to identify viable consensus pathways in sustainable development strategies that are marked by conflicts among different stakeholders. To do so, this study focuses on three case studies that are part of the EU project SMILE, its way of sustainability thinking, and its stakeholders to encapsulate different sustainability approaches and different needs for sustainable development. To identify critical success/failure factors in the search for sustainable development at the interface of economic, environmental, and social factors, we use interview results, first, to compose case study-specific pentagon models. These models offer a systematic framework for sustainability and, in general, distinguish between five key forces, that is, software (e. g., knowledge), hardware (e. g., research facilities), finware (e. g., financial support), ecoware (e. g., environmental amenities), and orgware (e. g., institutional support systems). In a second step, we use both the questionnaire results and a multi-criteria spider approach to quantify the relative importance of the pentagon factors for each stakeholder group. This way we are able to develop stakeholder-specific pentagon models. Although there are many applications of the basic pentagon model in the sustainability literature, our attempt can be seen as the first one that combines cases at different time and spatial scales to generalize the interfaces between scientific research and policy arenas.

AB  - Multi-stakeholder initiatives (MSIs) have emerged as a leading institutional approach for advancing sustainability globally. This paper examines three prominent MSIs that have developed sustainability metrics and a standard for US agriculture: Field to Market, the Stewardship Index for Specialty Crops and the National Sustainable Agricultural Standard Initiative. Using data from interviews and content analysis of initiative reports, two sets of analyses are presented. First, building on Paul Thompson's tri-partite theorization of sustainability, how each initiative is conceptualizing agricultural sustainability is analyzed. We find that two contrasting visions of sustainable agriculture for the USA have emerged from the three MSIs. One vision is a resource sufficiency approach focused on eco-efficiencies and the other vision is a functional integrity approach that emphasizes the maintenance of resilient agricultural and ecological systems. Second, we examine the governance practices of the MSIs to explain why such divergent conceptualizations of sustainability have been mapped out. We find that far from being a neutral forum, the internal dynamics of MSIs often reflect and reproduce existing power relationships among stakeholders. In concluding, we suggest that incremental improvements in sustainability can be achieved using MSIs, but more transformative changes may require other forms of governance.

AB  - Cattle ranching in the similar to 140,000 km(2) Brazilian Pantanal is considered one of the most important cases of sustainable use of natural resources in the global south. The region has had a successful history of balancing environmental protection with the production of >3.8 million cattle. However, global change, infrastructure projects, and deforestation, threaten the sustainable use of the Pantanal. Here, using Ostrom's design principles as a framework, we interviewed 49 local stakeholders and conducted a review of secondary information aiming to evaluate the sustainability of cattle ranching practices across the region and the threats to it. We show that well-defined property boundaries, congruence between appropriation and provision rules through low-intensity cattle ranching, and co-management of resources, are all key components for achieving sustainability in the Pantanal. However, we documented shortcomings in satisfying critical aspects of Orstrom's design principles. Specifically, we argue that the Pantanal needs better biodiversity and behavior monitoring, the creation of platforms or mechanisms to solve local conflicts around resource access and use, recognition by governments and international bodies of the local efforts to promote local sustainability, and the creation of networks effectively connecting existing sustainability initiatives.

AB  - Today, more than ever, achieving sustainability of business activities, intertwining social, economic, and environmental perspectives, is one of the most challenging objectives for companies. Project management processes are no exception. This paper aims to contribute to the current research knowledge through a systematic review of the literature on the integration of project management and sustainability. Specifically, the aim was to clarify the research domains of sustainable project management, and to understand the current state of development and the future research directions. Results indicate that academic literature about this topic is still in its infancy, but that scholars' attention is growing, opening new research directions. Based on the literature review results, we propose a new conceptual framework linking five key dimensions of sustainable project management: corporate policies and practices, resource management, life cycle orientation, stakeholders' engagement, and organizational learning.

AB  - The programme was undertaken for a period of two years (March, 1994 to February, 1996) to study the feasibility of installing, designing and laying out the farmers managed small-scale irrigation system for sustainable crop production in Uganda (East Africa) based on participatory approach. The work started having its nucleus activities in Masaka, one of the advanced districts in agriculture. The area used to receive bimodal rainfall giving birth of two crop seasons to a range of annual precipitation of about 1400 mm in a year. Because of sharp decline of annual rainfall (about 500-700 mm/year) from the year 1988 and onwards that leads the planners to emphasize the scientific approach of introducing irrigation water management for crop cultivation in order to get sustainable production. The programme consisted of bench mark survey of 27 randomly selected individual farmers having large, medium and small (>150, 50-150 and <50 hectare, respectively) holding size followed by a diagnostic survey to provide technical instruction and guidelines to the individual in accordance with water resources availability and land situations and model demonstration. A reconnaissance tour programme was also undertaken to rehabilitate the days long practices and earlier efforts along with to bring the resource personnel together in the field of irrigation. The work over the 2-year period recommended that the farmers having abundant water resources could be grouped into three categories; (1) having continuous flow of water connected with perennial sources within the farm area; (2) having lake/river as water source with considerable area under riverbed or river basin; (3) having existing water harvesting structures fully recharged with ground water or flowing surface water and plenty of pounded water with natural springs which could be brought under irrigated agriculture. It was also suggested two other categories of farm lands where either (1) there was possibility of constructing water harvesting structures for recycling the stored rain water for crop cultivation and to take conservational land treatments to preserve more moisture for growing crops under management of rainfed agriculture or (2) to improve the existing dug or tube wells to increase its capacity for livestock and domestic purposes and also to provide life saving irrigation to the standing crops on emergency basis. Small-scale irrigation systems based on farmers' participation for sustainable crop production was successfully designed and laid out befitting the individual farm requirements.

AB  - In becoming a reference, a constraint, a high performance action for all economic activities, sustainable development transforms not only productive and organisational practices but equally produces new subjects and research situations that require methodological renewal. On the event of a research programme on the elaboration of an evaluation approach of sustainable development in aquaculture, a methodological protocol was elaborated in a multidisciplinary manner while taking into consideration the representations of actors. This protocol also makes it possible to give an account of the territorial and institutional insertion (introduction) of fish farming systems. The logic of the coconstruction approach that is carried out, starting from the principles to identify the criteria and indicators, constitutes a standard dimension which could be applied to other fish farming systems and even to other sectors. After presenting the hypothesis and assumptions that justify the approach, the actors present the research programme while emphasising methodological aspects. In conclusion, they debate the importance and terms of generalising the method as well as the types of relationship built with the actors in this event.

AB  - This research aims to investigate the repercussions of an anomalous early summer Land Surface Temperature (LST) surge on food, energy, and human health within the National Capital Region (NCR) of India, with a specific focus on its potential influence on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). To attain this objective, the study employed various methods to evaluate the magnitude of the deviation in LST. MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) images were utilized to compute the monthly diurnal LST range, and the Standard Anomaly (StA) approach was employed to account for data dispersion. Additionally, Innovative Trend Analysis (ITA) and Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) were conducted to perform regionally specific trend analysis. Furthermore, the Ordinary Least Square (OLS) regression method was applied to investigate the relationship between StA and crop yields. The findings indicate a significant temperature increase in March, with a deviation of 3.5 degrees C above the average range. Additionally, the study reveals the standard anomaly (StA) of Land Surface Temperature (LST) during March fell within the range of -0.706 to 2.783 degrees C, while in April, it ranged from -0.781 to 3.263 degrees C, and in May, it ranged from -3.001 to 0.525 degrees C. The key significance of the study lies in the impacts of this early summer warming on the attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals. The reduction in crop yields as a result of this warming poses a substantial threat to achieving the SDG-2 target of Zero Hunger. Moreover, the adverse health effects stemming from the early summer warming impede the achievement of the SDG-3.4.1 target. Additionally, the high energy consumption induced by the warming directly affects SDG-6 on affordable and clean energy. The research underscores the critical importance of addressing the impacts of early summer warming to ensure the successful achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals in the National Capital Region of India. Policymakers and stakeholders should take into account the findings of this study to implement targeted strategies that mitigate the adverse effects of early summer warming on food, energy, and human health, and thereby contribute to the realization of the SDGs.

Analyses of variance was used in all three studies and in studies 2 and 3-to test for possible mediators-each variable was tested using Hayes' PROCESS macro (Hayes, 2013) with bootstrapping of 5,000 samples.FindingsResults demonstrate significant favouring of sustainability-minded firms. Some differences between consumers and investors were found but also notable commonalities such as a general propensity to favour purpose-oriented firms and similar determinations of trust in firms.Practical implicationsFindings could support more effective sustainability communications and firm decisions regarding investments in purpose- and sustainability-oriented initiatives. The results may also support designs to pursue and promote designations (e.g. B Corp) that legitimize sustainability claims.Originality/valueThis research was unique in its evaluation of two stakeholder types in the same context. Further, it provides new insights into how a firm's profit-purpose orientation affects stakeholder perceptions and assessments of trustworthiness.

AB  - Roll on-roll off (RoRo) shipping represents a maritime segment that could easily form part of an intermodal transport system, as cargo does not need to be lifted in ports; it is rolled' to and from sea. This paper investigates the operation of RoRo shipping services in Northern Europe, focusing on a set of services chartered by a major shipper whose demand has a great impact on the service design, potentially affecting the frequency of departures and even stipulating the use of specific vessels. The case of cooperation between Stora Enso, a major forest company in Sweden and Finland, and the shipping company Swedish Orient Line (SOL) is analysed, giving some insight into the way these RoRo services operate and manage to integrate successfully into sustainable intermodal transport chains. Despite various initiatives taken by different stakeholders, the level of integration of shipping in intermodal transport chains has been quite slow. This paper's results could contribute to the identification of barriers that prevent RoRo shipping from being a viable alternative to road transport for certain transport routes and assist in the discovery of policies and incentives that could lead to developing sustainable intermodal transport chains.

AB  - The current trend of higher education for sustainable urban development links with parallel developments in urban governance and environmental pedagogy. Many programs and policies identify cities and citizens as key drivers of change for sustainable futures, however scholarly work on the related pedagogies is lacking. These endeavors are clearly present in the Tampere city-region, Finland. Supported by national educational and city-regional strategies, the city is promoting sustainable lifestyles and infrastructures by means of multistakeholder governance including citizen participation and sustainability education. This paper analyzes, as a case study of transdisciplinary sustainability education, a collaboration between Tampere University, a skateboarding high school, and the Hiedanranta urban district developed as a real-life laboratory of sustainable urban development. We explore the pedagogical dimensions of the collaboration by drawing from the theoretical perspective of 'positive recognition' and conceiving the Hiedanranta skatescape-a socio-physical entity formed around skateboarding-as a 'boundary object'. The paper suggests urban environments act as boundary objects that enable productive collaboration between various actors when informed by pedagogies of positive recognition. In conclusion, we propose that the value of this approach, binding together multistakeholder governance and transdisciplinary learning, lies in its capacity to encourage novel forms of sustainable agency.

AB  - As urban water systems become increasingly stressed from climate change impacts, population growth and resource limitations, there is growing acceptance by scholars and practitioners of the need to transform practices towards more sustainable urban water management. However, insights into how strategic planning should be made operational to enable this transformation are limited; there is a need for a reliable diagnostic procedure that could assist planners, policy analysts and decision-makers in selecting and designing strategic action initiatives that best fit an urban water system's current conditions to enable desired system changes. This paper is the first step in the development of such a diagnostic approach by proposing a scope for an operational procedure that maps a system's current conditions and identifies its potential transformative capacity. It then reviews five existing analytic frameworks, which are influenced by transitions theory and resilience theory, and applies them each to a common empirical case study of successful transformative change in the stormwater management system of Melbourne, Australia. In this way, the paper explores how existing frameworks could potentially contribute to a diagnostic procedure for selecting and designing strategic action initiatives from the perspective of dynamic transformative change. The paper found that such a procedure should guide an analyst through steps that develop descriptive, explanatory and predictive insights to inform which strategic action initiatives best fit the current system conditions. The types of insights offered by different analytic frameworks vary, so a diagnostic procedure should be designed with a particular aim, problem or question in mind and the underpinning framework(s) selected accordingly.

AB  - Mineral and metals produced from mining are critical components of goods and services used in society and are required to support the transition to a low carbon future. Yet serious and unresolved questions about the economic, environmental and social outcomes of mining remain. This has resulted in a lack of trust in the mining industry's ability to act in the best interests of society. In this viewpoint piece the opportunity for mining to rebuild trust by working collaboratively with others to advance the agenda of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is discussed. It is argued that business strategy is required to secure the SDGs and that the economic management strategy "creating shared value" could help mining establish a framework for identifying opportunities to improve socio-economic outcomes and related core business performance. Challenges to implementing the strategy are explored and three examples, mapped retrospectively to the SDGs, are offered to illustrate the potential of creating shared value as business strategy for mining companies to rebuild their social contract.

AB  - Scenario planning first gained traction within corporations as an energy transition management tool, but recently gained popularity within sustainability. It is a process for exploring potential futures and thinking critically about complex decisions that involve high degrees of uncertainty. It is also effective in shifting mental models and engaging diverse stakeholders, making it ideal for complex sustainability problems. Scenario-planning insights are typically used in strategic planning, further aligning with sustainability's commitments to action-oriented solutions. However, as a participative process, success hinges on equitable participant engagement that is threatened by power imbalance. The current pilot study uses an experimental design to explore the impact of explicit acknowledgement of status differential and pre-event brainstorming on participation in a small group task. The task was selected based on its parallels to scenario-planning interactions. Twenty-four triads engaged in group deliberation while wearing devices that gather data to measure interactions. Afterward, participants completed a participation perception survey. Despite the popularity of brainstorming, results of the pilot study point to the utility of status concealment over individual-level brainstorming to bolster participation. Ultimately, this work contributes to a more nuanced understanding of participation in service of more robust, pluralistic sustainability decision-making.

AB  - The value of discourse in the mathematics classroom is evident across standards, policy documents, and research. The quality of discourse is associated with students' mathematical understanding and achievement. Productive mathematical discourse includes students providing explanations and critically listening to and evaluating the ideas of others. Such high-level discourse takes time to develop and is impacted by how teachers structure lessons and interact with students (e.g., talk moves). The present case study reports on an incremental professional development, S3D Approach, that guides teachers through a two-phase process to enhance small-group, student-to-student discourse. One middle school mathematics teacher implemented the incremental stages of the S3D Approach with support from a mathematics teacher educator, who conducted weekly observations and debrief meetings. Qualitative analyses revealed that, despite initial challenges, the S3D Approach became integrated into the teacher's practice, enabling the teacher to identify and build upon incremental improvements in the small-group discourse. Overall, the findings demonstrate how through a reframing of starting points and the definition of success, incremental PD supports sustainable changes in a teacher's practice and student engagement in productive mathematical discourse.

AB  - Sustainability transitions require societal change at multiple levels ranging from individual behavioral change to community projects, businesses that offer sustainable products as well as policy-makers that set suitable incentive structures. Concepts, methods and tools are currently lacking that help to initiate and design transition governance processes based upon an encompassing understanding of such diverse interactions of actors and intervention points. This article presents a methodological framework for the initiation and design of transition governance processes. Based upon a conceptualization of sustainability transitions as multilevel learning processes, the methodological framework includes participatory modeling, a systematic literature review and governance system analysis to identify social units (learning subjects and contexts), challenges (learning objects) and intervention points (learning factors) relevant for initiating case-specific transition governance processes. A case study on sustainable food systems in Ontario, Canada is provided to exemplify the application of the methodological framework. The results demonstrate the merit of combining stakeholder-based and expert-based methods, as several learning factors identified in the participatory process could not be found in the general literature, and vice versa. The methodological framework allowed for an integrated analysis of the diversity of existing initiatives in the case study region and specific intervention points to support place-based sustainability innovations. Initiators of transition governance processes can use the results by designing targeted interventions to facilitate and coordinate existing initiatives or by setting new impulses through purposeful action.

AB  - The micro, small, and medium enterprise (MSME) in the agriculture sector have become one of the most important pillars of the Indian economy as they provide employment opportunities with little capital outlay. This study identifies barriers to achieving sustainability in the Agri supply chain in India. The scope of the study was increased to determine the contextual relationships between the barriers and to rank them in relation to one another. The list of 11 barriers was enlisted after thorough literature and interaction with experts using the fuzzy-Delphi method. The causal relationship has been developed using Wings methodology. The results show that lack of information and mismanagement in handling the products after harvesting are crucial barriers to achieving sustainability in the Agri supply chain. The novelty of this work lies in identification of barriers achieving sustainability in Agri supply chain using integrated fuzzy-Delphi-Wings method. The stakeholders in the Agri supply chain will benefit from the research findings as they plan the strategic deployment of sustainability practices to achieve long-term competitive advantage.

AB  - Tea smallholders forma significant part of the global tea industry. They support the rural economy in several tea-producing regions in the world. However, their limited role in the tea value chain and numerous other issues pose major challenges to promote sustainability in the smallholders' tea sector. Of late, it has been observed that the adoption of organic cultivation has encouraged some of the tea smallholders to involve in the processing and marketing of tea, enabling the development of an alternative value chain. Based on the premise that value chain development is crucial to improve the smallholders' situation, we follow a mixed methods research approach to draw upon the recent developments in the tea sub-sector in Assam, India. The findings indicate the potential for the development of sustainable and inclusive value chain for the tea smallholders. However, such progress would requisite encouraging more growers to participate in the value chain, and mobilizing and organizing them towards collective actions through suitable institutional arrangements like producer organizations. Further, policy measures focusing on better governance of the smallholders' collectives, building trust, and creating value networks through strategic collaboration would be crucial to empower the growers and promote sustainability in the smallholders' tea production sector.

AB  - Within the adaptive co-management field, evaluation has been receiving increased attention over the last 10years. Although monitoring and evaluation are integral components of adaptive co-management, they are sometimes weakly incorporated. Participatory evaluation could play a role in embedding monitoring and evaluation more strongly, but there is very little empirical research about its outcomes and implications for adaptive co-management. Small-scale fisheries in Uruguay were used as case study as they are going through a governance transition; local multistakeholder councils have been formed to look for solutions to fishery-related problems in a collective manner. In one of these councils, we facilitated a participatory evaluation process with involvement of the four stakeholder groups (fishers, fisheries agency, coast guard and local governments). The objective was to investigate the potential of participatory evaluation for enhancing the two main pillars of adaptive co-management: collaboration and learning. Findings from interviews with workshop participants show that cooperation and communication among stakeholders were enhanced. However, trust only increased between some stakeholders, and existing conflicts were not resolved. The evaluation workshops became a learning space and stakeholders improved their skills to participate and interact with different actors. An important outcome was a series of operational agreements for the council, to overcome the weaknesses and challenges that the council was facing. Learning is crucial in the initial stage of an adaptive co-management process (and throughout it). The implications of the study are discussed in light of the scholarship on adaptive co-management, transdisciplinary research and sustainability science.

AB  - Purpose
   Distance universities are of great importance for establishing sustainability literacy, as they operate as multipliers for thousands of students. However, despite several advantages of e-learning environments compared to traditional class-teaching, there are still challenges regarding suitable e-learning tools and didactical models. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the effectiveness of several e-learning tools on students' knowledge and skills growth and to compare two learning paths, synchronous vs asynchronous, exploring how each affects the level of students' knowledge achievement and skills acquisition.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The empirical analysis is based on an online course "Participatory processes in environmental politics". International MSc and PhD students who enrolled in the course were from FernUniversitat in Hagen (Germany) and Aberta University (Portugal). The course was designed as the flipped classroom, applying different e-learning tools and activities, some synchronous and others asynchronous. A pre- and post-evaluation questionnaire was applied to evaluate students' knowledge and skills. Descriptive statistical analyses were carried out on this data.
   Findings
   Results showed that in the synchronous group, knowledge about theoretical approaches to citizen participation and sustainable environmental governance improved to a greater extent, whereas the asynchronous group showed greater improvement in nearly all skills related to intercultural communication and e-learning. Also, in the synchronous path, students enhanced their knowledge on "research application" to a greater extent.
   Originality/value
   Evaluating the effectiveness of different e-learning tools on students' sustainability knowledge and information and communication technologies skills is a fundamental issue. The study discusses these issues, contributing to enhancing the use of adequate and grounded e-learning models on sustainable development in higher education.

AB  - Poverty, lack of volunteering culture, and low level of literacy are some of the problems that challenge the true engagement of local communities in decision-making processes in developing countries. For effective engagement of communities in local projects, the World Bank has initiated the community-driven development (CDD) approach in Afghanistan. One of the CDD's programs was the Citizens Charter National Priority Program (CNPP) that reached the end of its first phase in 2020. Throughout the program, the World Bank has provided the basic services to urban and rural communities across Afghanistan. This research tends to assess to what extent people participated in the community-driven development projects in Afghanistan with special focus on Herat city, a city located in western Afghanistan. Applying a qualitative research approach, we conducted 61 semi-structured in-depth interviews with community development experts, urban managers, and members of community development councils in Herat city. Although citizens have participated in some aspects of the program, e.g., elections, establishment of community development councils (CDCs), prioritization, and implementation of infrastructure projects, this research has questioned the sustainability of CNPP. Despite the effectiveness of the program-economically speaking-CNPP has failed to truly engage women and underserved communities in decision-making process. Added to this, the program has been considered unsuccessful in empowering local communities and in institutionalizing the concept of "citizen participation." Moreover, it was also revealed that CCNPP prioritizes service delivery over social issues (e.g., empowerment, active participation of the citizens, institutionalization of CDCs, sustainable and continuous performance of CDCs, and public awareness). For sustainable operation of CDCs, the Afghan government should recognize CDCs as integral parts of the Afghan political system.

AB  - The concept of urban sustainable development has received increasing attention from the relevant Taiwan authorities. On the one hand, the concept of urban sustainable development can be adopted to address the migration and aging problems of the rural township population. On the other hand, the relevant authorities hoped to stimulate local economic activities, to attract the students and workers who had left the area, so that they would return to their hometowns to start a business or seek employment. Therefore, this study analyzes the driving forces of urban sustainable development, as well as its challenges and restrictions, with a focus on the urban stakeholders (residents, sojourners, and travelers). The urban stakeholders should have the opportunity to re-examine the future direction of urban sustainable development and to analyze the challenges involved from a variety of perspectives, thereby finding new opportunities for urban sustainable development. The four driving forces (cultural inheritance, environment preservation, economic development, and social consciousness) were applied to assess the adoption strategies of urban sustainable development. This study determined the status of satisfaction and importance for the driving aspects of urban sustainable development using the SIA (satisfaction & importance analysis) approach and analyzed the network relation structure based on the network relation map approach.

AB  - The future sustainability of irrigated agriculture in Mediterranean island communities faces a raft of economic, environmental and socio-economic challenges. Many of these are inextricably linked to the extreme levels of water scarcity that exist in the region. With a focus on Malta, we developed a water strategy to identify the priorities for action to support decision makers, practitioners and the agrifood industry in achieving agricultural and water resources sustainability. The methodology involved a combination of evidence synthesis, to inform the development of a Drivers-Pressures-State-Impact-Response framework. These priorities were then used to define a set of key actions under three thematic pillars of sustainability (environment, economy and society). Our analysis confirmed that irrigated agriculture in Malta is not only impacted by environmental factors such as the challenging climate and geography of the region but also strongly influenced by a range of economic (tourism development, European Union accession) and societal (population growth, environmental regulation) drivers of change. The developed strategy is underpinned by priority actions relating to improved water and soil management. The reduction of water and energy footprints in crop production, the establishment of demonstration farms and the support of policies that promote 'value adding' activities are examples of key priority actions for the environmental, economic and societal pillar, respectively. Regarding the scale of intervention, the analysis distinguishes research as being important for supporting many of the economy-focused actions.

AB  - While the majority of universities teach all students essential knowledge areas related to sustainability theories and practices, we are still unaware of the sustainable skills our students will need in the future. In an effort to improve the manner in which we design sustainability courses that enhance future skills for all students, we developed a two-step study method. First, we investigated the structure and key features of three universities' sustainable courses. Then, utilizing the knowledge gained in phase one, we redesigned the instrument for data collection and investigated the experiences and expectations of undergraduate students regarding the programs. We conducted three focus group interviews with fifteen undergraduates enrolled in a sustainability unit as a general elective course. Thai students enroll in sustainability programs and/or units for the following reasons: (1) sustainable employment preparedness, (2) future sustainable skills, and (3) relevance to their primary study. When we asked them what encouraged them to learn sustainability effectively, they identified multidisciplinary nature and digital skills as crucial. The majority of students participating in this initiative state that they anticipate that learning about sustainability and sustainable development will enhance their understanding of future careers. In addition, the majority of them anticipate acquiring and integrating technical (ESG) and global competencies, as well as novel competencies such as environmental analysis, sustainable finance and investment, global politics, and social impact assessment.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to explore and further explain the phenomena of supplier participation in addressing the sustainability-oriented objectives of a supply chain. Specifically, the paper explains how a buyer can integrate sustainability concerns among its suppliers. The study is based in the context of the Indian school feeding (mid-day meal) program and approaches the issue from the perspective of a mid-day meal provider.
   Design/methodology/approach This paper first explains how the mid-day meal providers in India explicitly address the social and economic dimensions of sustainability. Thereby, it conducts an exploratory case study on a renowned meal provider with the objective to understand the nature of its efforts toward supplier participation through in-depth interviews.
   Findings As evident in the case, from the buyer's perspective, the key to success in winning supplier participation in addressing the sustainability-oriented supply chain objectives largely revolves around efforts along the critical aspects of policy development, policy implementation, and intent building with suppliers.
   Originality/value This paper propagates a threefold value by outlining the central importance of the focus on efforts and challenges for understanding supplier participation in sustainable supply chain management (SSCM). First, the paper is among the initial studies to focus on ground-level efforts and challenges for a mid-day meal provider, and outlines best practices. Second, the case presents revelatory insights on SSCM from the perspective of supplier participation. For example, it demonstrates the relevance of supply-chain-based social identification in governing supplier willingness to participate in a buyer's SSCM. Third, the findings also extend critical implications toward SSCM theory and practice.

AB  - PurposeThis study aims to examine how male and female students' sustainability expectations of Higher Educational Institutions (HEIs) differ in various cultural contexts.Design/methodology/approachBased on a sample of 239 business students from the USA and Germany, a mixed qualitative-quantitative research design is employed combining content analysis and Kano analysis to examine gender- and country-different students' sustainability expectations.FindingsFemale students across countries have higher sustainability expectations than males. Gender equality and inclusion are more important to female than male students. While male students considered most attributes as indifferent, female students in the US considered many sustainability attributes as one-dimensional, and those in Germany considered production and consumption and equity and inclusion as must-be attributes.Research limitations/implicationsA larger, more representative sample could provide deeper insights into students' sustainability expectations. The Kano model may not fully capture the complexity of these expectations due to its reliance on predefined definitions. More comprehensive and dynamic approaches are needed to understand and predict students' sustainability expectations.Practical implicationsGrouping HEIs' sustainability transformation attributes based on students' basic, performance and excitement needs supports quality and expectation management at HEIs by prioritizing measures and aligning sustainability communication.Originality/valueTo the best of the authors' knowledge, this study is the first to apply Kano analysis to examine and compare students' future-oriented normative sustainability expectations of their HEIs across different gender groups and countries. It enables more profound and realistic insights into barriers and enablers of HEIs' sustainability transformations and highlights how unmet expectations can impact stakeholder behavior across different country contexts.

AB  - Manufacturing and supply chain sectors are undergoing a paradigm change driven by the growing use of distributed renewable energy. Under demand and generation uncertainty, this paper aims to allocate wind turbine, solar photovoltaics and energy storage units in a three-tier supply chain network to achieve eco-friendly operations with minimum cost. We propose a mixed-integer stochastic programming model that involves the production-inventory and microgrid capacity decisions along with the hourly energy transactions to meet the electrical loads of factories, warehouse, and retail stores. Our study advances existing supply chain design methods by explicitly incorporating transactive energy, materials, information and cash flows into a holistic optimization framework. The performance and scalability of the model is tested in two network instances with various facility locations, machine capacity, and climate conditions. Results show that onsite renewable generation enables large industrial consumers to achieve environmental sustainability as well as to create new revenue stream through the participation in transactive energy market. The study also indicates that feed-in tariff, time-of-use rate, two-way energy trading can lower the utility cost and accelerate the adoption of variable generation technology.

AB  - Background: The Healthy Lifestyle Program for women (HeLP-her) is a low-intensity, self-management program which has demonstrated efficacy in preventing excess weight gain in women. However, little is known about the implementation, reach, and sustainability of low-intensity prevention programs in rural settings, where risk for obesity in women is higher than urban settings. We aimed to evaluate a low-intensity healthy lifestyle program delivered to women in a rural setting to inform development of effective community prevention programs.
   Methods: A mixed method hybrid implementation and evaluation study, guided by the RE-AIM framework (addressing the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance), was undertaken. Data collection tools included anthropometric measures, program checklists, questionnaires, and semi-structured interviews with participants and local stakeholders. The RE-AIM self-audit tool was applied to assess evaluation rigor.
   Results: Six hundred and forty-nine women from 41 relatively socio-economic disadvantaged communities in Australia participated: mean age 39.6 years (+/- SD 6.7) and body mass index of 28.8 kg/m(2) (+/- SD 6.9). A betweengroup weight difference of -0.92 kg (95% CI -1.67 to -0.16) showed program effectiveness. Reach was broad across 41 towns with 62% of participants reporting influencing some of the health behaviors of their families. Strong implementation fidelity was achieved with good retention rates at 1 year (76%) and high participant satisfaction (82% of participants willing to recommend this program). Over 300 multi-level community partnerships were established supporting high adoption. Stakeholders reported potential capacity to implement and sustain the prevention program in resource poor rural settings, due to the low-intensity design and minimal resources required.
   Conclusions: Our comprehensive RE-AIM evaluation demonstrates that an evidence-based obesity prevention program can be successfully implemented in real-world settings. The program achieved broad reach, effectiveness, and satisfaction at the community and stakeholder level, revealing potential for program sustainability. The evaluation addressed implementation knowledge gaps to support future obesity prevention program scale-up.

AB  - Sustainability's global importance has amplified the role of universities in achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through research, education, and community engagement. This study aims to provide valuable insights into the role of Arab universities in promoting sustainability within the context of global higher education. This study analyzes the performance of 200 universities from 15 Arab countries in the THE IMPACT Rankings. Their performance was compared to 135 universities from three of the leading world-class higher education systems: Canada, UK, and USA. Results: A global demand for sustainable development, Arab universities face challenges in improving their contributions to the SDGs and sustainability rankings. Despite the impressive growth in the participation of Arab universities in THE IMPACT Rankings yet lags in quality and impact of Arab universities contributions towards SDGs. The policy implications underscore the importance of institutional commitment to sustainability in Arab universities, urging the alignment of policies, funding, and curriculum with the United Na-tions Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Arab universities need to bridge performance gaps, promote green initiatives, and contribute effectively to the achievement of SDGs while recognizing the diverse socio-economic context and priorities of the Arab region.

AB  - The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) was established in 1967 to promote the integration and creation of new opportunities for citizens of ASEAN member countries. ASEAN member countries have signed mutual recognition agreements on services (including services in the construction industry) since 2005 to facilitate the movement of human resources in ASEAN countries, with engineering services qualifications being one of the eight professional qualification recognition schemes in the region. In particular, a recent trend in the construction industry is the use of building information modeling (BIM). While BIM practitioners are increasing, BIM Practitioner Certifications (BPCs) have not yet been legalized and recognized. This study conducted interviews and a survey with industry experts, finding as a result that the recognition of the competency of BIM practitioners is in demand and needs to be legalized with the recognition of experienced engineers via registration or licensing to include BPCs. This is an important step for removing artificial barriers to the free movement and practice of professional engineers amongst ASEAN countries. Additionally, evidence suggests that the BIM workforce's benefits only become realizable when BIM certifications are systematic and recognized. Based on the survey results and expert interviews, BIM practitioners are certificated according to three main roles: manager, coordinator and modeler. Finally, a framework for issuing BPCs is proposed in this study. This study's results are expected to contribute significantly to the success of BIM practitioner mobility among ASEAN member countries for sustainable economic development.

AB  - Disruptions (systemic disturbances) are crucial to initiate and accelerate sustainability transformations of large-scale social systems (be they socio-ecological, socio-technical, or socioinstitutional). Their emergence, characteristics and effects strongly relate to the role of agents who aim to disrupt and transform the status quo, and which thus possess what we call disruptive agency. In this paper, we highlight the epistemic dimension of disruptive agency in social transformations, first by conceptualizing disruptive agents as epistemic outsiders with respect to the social system that they intend to disrupt and transform, and second by connecting this conceptualization to notions of belief, social practices, social networks, discourses, or institutions. We identify five advantages of this approach. Firstly, it informs and conceptually enables various promising interdisciplinary avenues to explore and potentially influence transformative change towards sustainability. Secondly, an epistemic conception of disruptive agency offers a key for an integrated analysis of the individual and collective levels of agency involved in sustainability transformations. Thirdly, the notion of epistemic outsiders conceptually connects agent positions across system boundaries that are understood to be of crucial importance for sustainability transformations respectively (e.g., "niche innovators" or "regime intermediaries") but which lack an integrated understanding. Fourthly, an epistemic perspective additionally highlights the changing requirements and challenges resulting in two principal stages of transformations unfolding overtime, namely before/after a new epistemic layout is shared by a majority of agents. Finally, the above features allow to derive and conceive of new intervention formats and strategies.

AB  - Sustainability science research conducted with Indigenous collaborators must be Indigenous-led and achieve impacts that are grounded in local values and priorities, both for ethical reasons and to achieve more robust outcomes. However, there has been limited focus on determining how best to evaluate the way research is used, shared and created to adaptively solve complex sustainable issues facing Indigenous lands. In this paper, we outline a collaborative and adaptive approach for conducting Indigenous-led evaluations of sustainability research and show how this approach was applied to evaluate cross-cultural knowledge co-production practice and impact in Australia's jointly managed and World Heritage-listed Kakadu National Park. As part of an Indigenous-led research project, indicators were co-developed by Indigenous and non-Indigenous research team members to monitor the health of the knowledge-sharing and co-production practices that underpinned the design, management and success of the project's research activities. The evaluations focused on determining whether research activities were providing negotiated benefits for local Indigenous people; helping to restore and protect agreed values in priority areas; and supporting Indigenous-led collaborative knowledge sharing and research practices. In Kakadu, we show how the Indigenous-led design of the research evaluation empowered the usability and benefits of knowledge which was negotiated, shared and co-created. The approach shows how sustainability science can be evaluated by Indigenous leaders to test if and how research practice and impact is responding to their priorities for their traditional estates.

AB  - In view of the significant global challenges, this article analyzes and suggests pragmatic solutions for organizations to transform from sustainability risk management to creating a positive impact. Positive impact is defined by products and services that are created with the purpose of solving societal problems. It reflects the shift from reducing an organization's negative footprint to achieving a significant net positive impact on society and the planet. This article shows that such a mindset shift is observed on the level of the leadership and the organization. This explorative, case-based research validates the Dyllick-Muff BST typology and identifies strategic differentiators of Positive Impact Organizations, including their governance, culture, external validation, and a higher purpose reflected in their products and services. This research is translated into two tools for practitioners: the Strategic Innovation Canvas (SIC) and the Positive Impact Framework (PIF). The SIC serves as a quick assessment for organizations to get started. It consists of eight action dimensions: (1) sustainability in the organization, (2) transparency and board support, (3) leadership perspective, (4) targets and incentives, (5) societal stakeholders, (6) triple value reporting, (7) market framing, and (8) products and services. The PIF offers step-by-step guidance during the organizational transformation. The article sketches a new field of research for both scholars and practitioners in organizational transformation towards positive impacts. It bridges business sustainability and strategy through an innovation approach. By recognizing the importance of the underlying mindset shifts, it connects the fields of organizational and personal development.

AB  - This paper presents a holistic approach to sustainable urban brownfield redevelopment where specific focus is put on the integration of a multitude of subsurface qualities in the early phases of the urban redevelopment process, i.e. in the initiative and plan phases. Achieving sustainability in brownfield redevelopment projects may be constrained by a failure of engagement between two key expert constituencies: urban planners/designers and subsurface engineers, leading to missed opportunities and unintended outcomes in the plan realisation phase. A more integrated approach delivers greater benefits. Three case studies in the Netherlands, Belgium and Sweden were used to test different sustainability assessment instruments in terms of the possibility for knowledge exchange between the subsurface and the surface sectors and in terms of cooperative learning among experts and stakeholders. Based on the lessons learned from the case studies, a generic decision process framework is suggested that supports holistic decision making. The suggested framework focuses on stakeholder involvement, communication, knowledge exchange and learning and provides an inventory of instruments that can support these processes.

AB  - Municipal and regional leaders' achievements for synchronised sustainability transitions are still not enough. Systemic, systematic and strategic cross-sectoral collaboration and co-creation are needed. However, sectors isolated in silos leads to suboptimal measures and strategies, and a reductionist view on what hinders and enables joint action towards full sustainability. Consequently, methodological support for addressing the coordinative challenge is often not asked for. This study investigates the observed reductionist perspective as foundation for developing enhanced methodological support for strategic sustainable development (SSD) and further aimed to gain insight into how leaders can be better supported to understand their current reality of barriers and enablers for cross-sectoral SSD work and to prototype such support. Results from fieldwork with leaders in six municipalities and regions suggest that both frequency and depth of barriers and enablers in relation to elements for SSD are insufficient. Nine categories were identified and combined with SSD core elements into a diagnostic tool.

AB  - Over the last decade and a half various aspects of the sustainability of food production have been evaluated by different groups of stakeholders. National and federal legislators have looked at the types of chemicals allowed and the acceptable maximum residue levels permitted for particular crops and conditions. Commercial firms (in both the processing and retail sectors) have developed private company labels that distinguish them from competitors. Their suppliers have to comply under a 'licence to deliver'. Some organizations that are concerned with environmental issues have developed guidelines. Finally, producer organizations have developed their own labels. The assumption is that farmers who comply have products with added value, which give rise to better opportunities to sell. Some processors source only from growers complying with such schemes. This paper highlights past endeavours, rules and tools to assure food safety, and present initiatives to bring sustainability into the pre-competitive domain. It also identifies future requirements for sustainability indicators and baseline studies, and demonstrates the need to move from indicator values to target values. This approach allowsfor the quantitative monitoring of environmental safety that will be required for the food industry of the future, just as food safety is now and was in the past.

AB  - Small mining towns are often single-industry towns that turn to ghost towns or face negative socio-economic impacts upon mine closure. This study qualitatively explores the roles that mining companies and other key stakeholders (should) play in the development of local economies of the small mining communities to bring about economic sustainability, employing a constant comparative analysis. A small mining town in South Africa is the case study. Legislative and policy frameworks were scrutinized for their effectiveness in promoting economic sustainability. In-depth interviews with key stakeholders were carried out. Key factors limiting the effective implementation of developmental strategies were also explored. The study finds that weak community involvement, lack of trust, poor collaboration, poor municipal capacity, and legislation and policy flaws impact economic sustainability. Sustainable local economic development efforts are reported though. However, such efforts are insufficient because of the legislation and policy frameworks that are promoting short-term growth. Also, the town's overdependence on the mining company, local government not optimally fulfilling their roles and responsibilities, and minimal community members' participation on local economic development are other hindrances. However, the fact that the mining company and local municipality do acknowledge the shortcomings in their efforts towards promoting economic sustainability is a promise in minimizing the socio-economic effects of mine closures.
   Stakeholder perspectives of economic sustainability of small mining townsThe purpose of this study is to find ways to minimize the socio-economic effects that bedevil small mining towns when the extraction of the mineral becomes unviable.

AB  - Using a pre-post design, this study investigated an educational sustainability initiative's impact on ethical decision-making, science motivation, and classroom environment perceptions among 60 pre-service teachers at Sakhnin College in northern Israel. Data were collected through self-report questionnaires and analyzed with multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA), structural equation modeling (SEM), and hierarchical linear modeling (HLM). The results indicated significant improvements in ethical decision-making skills, moderated by baseline moral reasoning. Motivation to learn science also increased, influenced by perceived content relevance and intrinsic motivation, with socioeconomic status and teaching experience acting as moderators. A three-way interaction of gender, religiosity, and collaborative group work involvement predicted improvements in the classroom atmosphere. These findings suggest that sustainability education enhances ethical reasoning, motivation, and classroom dynamics, with demographic factors playing important roles. The study highlights the value of collaborative learning environments in teacher education and the relevance of sustainability topics in fostering critical thinking about ethical issues. It demonstrates how sustainability can inspire teachers to embed values of responsibility and cooperation into their practice, enhancing the quality of the educational environment and encouraging a broader commitment to sustainability within the educational system. These findings highlight the value of sustainability education in enhancing pre-service teachers' ethical reasoning, motivation, and classroom dynamics, offering insights for teacher-education programs to foster responsibility and cooperation among future educators.

AB  - The devastating COVID-19 epidemic has highlighted the weaknesses in supply chains (SCs) globally. To ensure smooth production in the current and post-COVID-19 era, the policymakers should focus on establishing a sustainable and resilient supply chain (SC) by reconfiguring their existing SC strategies. This study aims to investigate the difficulties poultry industry (PI) faces in coping with the effects of SC disruptions brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic from a developing country viewpoint: Bangladesh. Through literature review and expert opinion, 20 barriers were identified and categorized into five dimensions (i.e., social, environmental, economic, technical, and institutional) related to sustainability and resilience. Pareto analysis was conducted to screen out 'Vital few' barriers and later prominence vectors and cause-effect relationships of these barriers was examined through decision making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) approach. Results indicate that natural and man- made disasters, quality of chicks, feed and vaccine, inaccurate forecasting, lack of access to technology, and environmental issues are the most significant barriers to achieve sustainability and resiliency. Also, the mitigation strategies to achieve simultaneous sustainability and resiliency in this sector are outlined for managers and practitioners.

AB  - A constantly increasing number of investors and stakeholders are seeking key sustainability related information. The necessity of third-party assurance of non-financial disclosure has been dwelt on in various literature. External assurance of sustainability reporting plays a key role in raising credibility, trust and engagement of the reporting organization's stakeholders. Yet, limited research has been done on how the external assurance process can be used to strengthen internal reporting and management systems, thereby, enhancing Board and CEO reliance on material and trustworthy information. This paper examines the status quo of Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) data management at a multinational company, identifying challenges and opportunities in integrating sustainability measurement and management approaches. Questionnaires submitted in sites located in four continents and covering close to 90% of environmental impacts of the company, identified worst performing sites of HSE data management as those with cumulated environmental impact of over 66% of the total. In addition, 50% of sites implementing internal controls do not meet requirements of a reasonable assurance statement. Recommendations on urgent measures to be implemented and an HSE data Management Improvement Tree are provided as practical contributions to research on tools to enhance processes between company-internal actors and linkages among sustainability accounting, management control and internal communication and reporting methods.

AB  - The primary purpose of this paper is to call for more research on the competencies needed to promote sustainable urban development. Our premise is that sustainable urban development does not occur without transcending differing interests and identifying novel ways to collaborate across organisational and institutional boundaries. Relatedly, sustainable urban development calls for mobilisation and pooling of scattered assets. Therefore, sustainable urban development calls for enhanced competencies that significantly differ from the traditional capabilities valued in public administration. This premise leads us to determine what competencies are needed to support sustainable urban development and to ask how fragmented capabilities can be pooled to serve the common purpose. Sustainable urban development necessitates transformative system change, dependent on diverse stakeholders, relying on many actors' knowledge and capabilities instead of a few selected actors' expertise. To achieve a systemic perspective, we need to be able to group the capabilities and competencies; otherwise. We propose a conceptual framework drawing on insights from public administration, management studies, organisation studies, and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) that might allow us to move from individual capabilities to shared competencies and collective learning processes, thus adding analytical leverage to our efforts to strengthen the competencies embedded in systems but held by individuals. For analytical purposes, we adopt the concept of the competence set. It is geared toward identifying how different capabilities of many actors could be integrated at a systemic level so that a set would serve both the entire urban system and the actors embedded in it.

AB  - The Grain-for-Green Program (GFGP) in China, one of the largest payment fot ecosystem services (PES) pro-grams, has been regarded as an effective approach to achieving sustainable development. However, empirical research on factors motivating GFGP participation willingness remains limited and the comparison of the influencing pathways under different compensation scenarios is lacked. In this case study of farm households' willingness of participation in Mulan Paddock, China, based on a participatory rural appraisal with 11 sample towns and 438 valid questionnaires, the structural equation model was applied to identify key factors influencing participation in GFGP in Mulan Paddock before (2000) and after (2014) the program under different compen-sation scenarios (i.e. with or without subsidies). It was found that 84.28% of farm households had increased income after the implementation of the GFGP. When the government provided subsidies, the past program support would dominate the willingness to participate in the program. When the government did not provide subsidies, subjective perceptions about the ecological and economic benefits and awareness of landscape pro-tection were further supplemented as the most important factors for household participation. Under the subsi-dized scenario, neighborhood behavior could enhance household participation in the GFGP, while the participation decision was negatively influenced without subsidies. The findings provide guidance for better implementation of the next round GFGPs in China, and also for investigating the correlation between PES and social welfare in other non-developed areas.

AB  - The agri-fresh produce industry confronts problems in minimizing food waste and achieving supply chain sustainability due to its complicated structure and lack of stakeholder participation. Significant food waste at numerous supply chain stages undermines the triple bottom line (Society, economy and environment) and wastes resources. Stakeholder collaboration, research, and information exchange can all help to minimize waste and improve sustainability. This study identifies barriers to implementing collaborative practices through literature analysis and expert insights and categorizes them into seven dimensions: relationship management practice, contractual and economic practice, joint practice, technological and information sharing practice, relationships management practice, and supply chain design practice. Furthermore, the grey-Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (grey-DEMATEL) and Analytic Network Process (ANP) were employed to develop an integrated framework that identifies interrelationships and prioritizes dimensions and attributes. The influence relationship diagraph helps decision-makers make policy recommendations by understanding the cause-effect interrelationships among the dimensions and their corresponding barriers. Finally, sensitivity analysis was performed to ensure that the results are robust and reduce decision-making biases.

AB  - This study adopts a multidimensional approach to examining sustainability reporting practices among notebook manufacturers, integrating traditional corporate sustainability reports with social media data from platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and Reddit. Using advanced machine learning techniques, including multi-label classification and BERT-based sentiment analysis, the research highlights the key environmental, social, and economic dimensions that consumers prioritize. The findings reveal a significant misalignment between consumer concerns, reflected in social media discourse, and the focus of corporate sustainability reports. While companies emphasize environmental impacts and supply chain management, consumers prioritize product reliability, community obligations, and educational initiatives. This gap indicates a need for companies to realign their sustainability strategies to better meet consumer expectations, emphasizing trust-building, community engagement, and educational efforts. Despite these differences, the study also identifies shared concerns between consumers and producers, such as environmental impacts, supply chain sustainability, and transparency in sustainability claims. Based on these insights, the study recommends fostering transparent communication, engaging in inclusive dialogue, and committing to accountable actions across all sustainability dimensions. By aligning corporate reporting with consumer expectations, this research provides guidance to help companies advance towards a circular economy and enhance Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) in the electronics industry, ultimately benefiting both companies and consumers in the pursuit of a more sustainable future.

AB  - Purpose
   The purpose of this paper is to integrate impostor syndrome and leadership research to identify antecedents of impostor syndrome, their impact on sustainable leader behaviors. The paper also postulates the moderating effect of mindfulness and leader member exchange on impostor syndrome and sustainable leader behaviors, respectively.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The paper relies on an integrative approach of literature review on impostor syndrome and leadership. After identifying gaps in impostor syndrome research and its intersectionality with the constructs of contextual leadership theory, an integrative conceptual framework was formulated incorporating antecedents, consequences and moderators of impostor syndrome.
   Findings
   Three antecedents of impostor syndrome were identified from the literature, namely, gender, family/social role expectation and personality traits. Additionally, this paper also unearths contextual factors as yet another antecedent to impostor syndrome. Negative impact of impostor syndrome on leader behaviors such as managerial decision-making, innovative work behavior (IWB) and organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) were established by connecting those to the three primary characteristics of impostor syndrome, namely, low self-efficacy, fear of failure and perceived fraudulence, respectively. Finally, the paper also posits the moderating role of leader member exchange and mindfulness and proposes mindfulness training as an effective intervention for impostor syndrome.
   Research limitations/implications
   This being a conceptual paper will benefit from empirical studies that corroborate theoretical posits. The scope of studying the effect of impostor syndrome on sustainable leader behavior was limited to three major variables, namely, managerial decision-making, IWB and OCB. Thus, it calls for a more elaborate model of impostor syndrome including other relevant leader behaviors.
   Practical implications
   The model when applied in organizational context addresses the need for mindfulness training to reduce the effect of impostor syndrome among leaders. Leaders will exhibit sustainable behaviors when provided with the right kind of training.
   Originality/value
   The study attempts to integrate the two independent constructs, impostor syndrome and leadership to establish a novel and meaningful connection and throws light to the unaddressed antecedents, consequences and moderators of its impact on sustainable leader behaviors. From learning and development practitioners' perspective, it also signifies the effectiveness of mindfulness training among employees' personal and professional development.

AB  - The extant literature does not provide consolidated knowledge on the use of Industry 4.0 in supply chains of emerging markets. This systematic literature review investigated the benefits, use, challenges, and mitigation measures related to Industry 4.0 technologies in supply chain management within thirteen "major emerging markets". Industry 4.0 integrates technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), big data analytics, and cloud computing, and it offers tangible benefits for manufacturing and supply chains. However, its adoption faces significant obstacles, particularly in emerging economies. This study used the PSALSAR framework and PRISMA methodology to systematically review 87 peer-reviewed research articles on Industry 4.0 in the supply chain context of thirteen major emerging economies. Findings revealed that while IoT, big data, and artificial intelligence are frequently applied, other technologies such as cloud computing and robotics are underutilized. Key challenges identified include data integration, cyber-security, high upfront investment, weak policy, and business risks. Mitigation strategies proposed include the development of supportive policies, management backing, training, and improved data security. Tangible benefits such as sustainably using resources, reducing power use, enabling collaboration among supply chain partners, incorporating asset traceability, and minimizing meat contamination were evident. This research provides useful insights into the current status of Industry 4.0 adoption in emerging markets, helping stakeholders to navigate towards a more digitized, efficient future.

AB  - Promoting pesticide reduction is a critical component of achieving sustainable agriculture. However, the challenges involved in coordinating diverse stakeholder demands pose difficulties in promoting pesticide reduction behavior. To reveal the evolutionary paths of the decision-making processes of each player under various influencing factors and optimize pesticide reduction policies, this paper proposes a three-way evolutionary game model that considers the interests of the local governments, farmers, and consumers. The study reveals six stable equilibrium strategies in the evolutionary game system of pesticide reduction for sustainable agriculture (SA). Under polycentric governance, ideal states allow local governments to regulate farmers' pesticide reduction and consumers' purchases of green agricultural products. Regulatory measures such as providing technical and in-kind subsidies for pesticide reduction, imposing penalties for the overuse of pesticides, and promoting public awareness influence farmers' and consumers' decisions when it comes to reducing pesticides and purchasing green produce. Moreover, the total benefits of pesticide reduction for farmers and the utility of green produce consumption for consumers are primary factors that influence the evolutionary game system's eventual evolution toward different stable equilibrium strategies. These factors primarily affect the supply and demand of green products, which in turn impacts pesticide reduction. This study enhances the policy analysis of pesticide reduction and provides valuable insights into constructing a pesticide reduction policy system based on polycentric governance.

AB  - Sustainable agriculture in arid and semi-arid regions faces unique challenges that require targeted assessment and intervention. Addressing the knowledge gap in this context, the current study evaluates the sustainability performance of 50 rainfed farms in the Za & euml;r Region of northwestern Morocco using farming systems sustainability), which encompasses agro-ecological, social and economic criteria to assess the three pillars of sustainability. Customized assessment criteria and a tailored scoring system, specific to the region's context, are employed, resulting in a comprehensive grid with 18 indicators across nine components. Data analysis and visualization were facilitated using statistical methods and an Excel macro. The findings reveal limitations in the sustainability of the surveyed farms. Socio-territorial factors, including issues with product quality, insufficient farmer training, limited workforce mobilization and low social involvement, contribute to the overall sustainability challenges. Agroecologically, low crop diversification, inadequate space management, and excessive reliance on chemical inputs are identified as areas of concern. On the economic scale, low specialization levels hinder economic viability despite some financial autonomy. The study emphasizes the need for interventions to enhance sustainability in rainfed agrosystems. Recommendations are provided to address socio-territorial constraints, improve agricultural practices, and promote economic viability. The findings have implications for policymakers, farmers and stakeholders, offering valuable insights for prioritizing strategies and actions to achieve sustainable agriculture in arid and semi-arid regions.

Conventional synthetic nanoparticles, though promising for enhancing crop yields and mitigating environmental stressors, pose risks of phytotoxicity, cytotoxicity, and genotoxicity manifested through stunted plant growth, impaired germination, and root defects. This highlights the necessity of strategic nanoparticle concentration management and mitigation strategy development. Green nanopriming has emerged as an eco-conscious panacea, harnessing the intrinsic reducing capabilities of plant extracts to synthesize nanoparticles through green chemistry principles aligned with biocompatibility. Green nanopriming epitomizes the synergistic integration of cutting-edge nanotechnology with nature's wisdom, transcending applications in crop enhancement to encompass green nanopesticides, nutrient solubilization, and quality optimization. This holistic approach catalyzes sustainable agricultural transformation to address food security while preserving ecological integrity. Continuous interdisciplinary research amalgamating nanotechnology, plant biology, and environmental sciences is crucial for elucidating mechanisms, assessing risks and ensuring responsible deployment of this innovative technology. The advent of green nanopriming heralds an environmentally- conscious paradigm shift where advanced technology coexists symbiotically with nature, paving the path towards resilient, sustainable agricultural landscapes that meet growing global food demands while safeguarding planetary resources.

AB  - Recently, manufacturing companies aspire to implement reverse logistics in response to stakeholders' requirements to reduce negative environmental consequences, improve organizational sustainable performance and ultimately increase competitive advantage. However, implementing reverse logistics can be impeded by a criteria framework, and necessitates the careful analysis of how such criteria interact with each other in the presence of uncertainty. Thus, in this study, we propose an integrated multi- criteria decision-making (MCDM) methodology that leverages the Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) under Intuitionistic Fuzzy (IF) environment and Evaluation Based on Distance to Average Solution (EDAS). Within the proposed methodology, firstly, the IF-DEMATEL is applied to obtain the interrelationships between the criteria/barriers and then, the EDAS method is applied to prioritize the criteria based on the appraisal scores evaluation. An application case within the Nigerian manufacturing sector was utilized to illustrate the viability of the proposed methodology. The study results indicate that the highly prioritized barriers to implementing reverse logistics within the Nigerian manufacturing sector include low product quality, risk of storing hazardous materials and low technical expertise. Consequently, this study makes a profound contribution to the theory and practice of reverse logistics by presenting an integrated MCDM methodology that can effectively address the criticality of barriers in the way of reverse logistics progression in a complex and uncertain scenario.

AB  - Education for Environmental Citizenship plays an important role in social change toward sustainable development, achieving economic, social, and environmental balance through informed, cooperative, and participative citizens. There are several pedagogical models with the potential to involve students in environmental activities, but no specific model suitable for primary education is found. This article describes the preliminary investigation phase of a Design-Based Research that resulted in the development of the first prototype of a Pedagogical Model of Education for Environmental Citizenship in Primary Education (students aged 6 to 10 years), in Portugal. This preliminary investigation phase was based on a systematic analysis and literature review on the topic (thesis, articles, projects, and curricular guidelines for primary education), seeking to answer the following research questions: (1) According to the current world characteristics, which learning outcomes should an environmental citizen achieve, and which of them can be promoted in primary education? (2) What are the most appropriate teaching methodologies and strategies for promoting environmental citizen learning outcomes in primary education? The methodology used is presented, and the proposed prototype is described, along with the desired learning outcomes that are considered necessary for the formation of an Environmental Citizen and the most appropriate methodologies and educational activities to promote them.

AB  - This study investigates the sustainability and social equity impacts of the ongoing transition toward a low carbon society in Japan to assess the merits of top-down and bottom-up approaches.
   The research uses mixed methods, incorporating householder and energy expert surveys, scenario design utilizing the Japanese MARKAL/TIMES framework, and sustainability and social equity evaluation. Surveys identify householder energy system and participation preferences, alongside energy expert input on social equity and policy design. Scenario building is undertaken to compare energy system outcomes between the strategic Japanese policy approach and a user driven approach to energy transition, both cognizant of 2050 environmental goals. Both scenarios are comparatively assessed using a holistic sustainability evaluation process.
   Conclusions identify the impact of liberalization and subsequent householder participation in the energy system in Japan, when compared to a strategic, policy driven approach. Both approaches have positive ramifications on social equity and policy burden distribution outcomes. However, the household participation scenario delivers a more equitable outcome, distributing energy policy burdens in a fairer manner through the realization of an energy system which is safe, stable and affordable.
   The findings have practical applications in participatory policy design, and the development of energy policy which can achieve transition goals while being sensitive to householder preferences and social equity concerns. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The study aimed to provide organisations with evidence-based insights and recommendations that can help them to create more effective and sustainable partnerships and to leverage collaborative learning to drive innovation and growth. The examination is performed using game theory as a mathematical framework to analyse the interaction of the decision-makers, where one alliance's decision is contingent on the decision made by others in the partnership. There are 20 possible games out of 120 outcomes that can be grouped into four different types; each type has been divided into several categories. Design/methodology/approach - The research methodology included secondary and primary data collection using empirical data, the Delphi technique for obtaining qualitative data, a research questionnaire for collecting quantitative data and computer simulation (1,000 cases, network resources and cooperative game theory). The key variables collected and measured when analysing a strategic alliance were identified, grouped and mapped into the developed model. Findings - Most respondents ranked reputation and mutual benefits in Type 1 games relatively high, averaging 4.1 and 3.85 of a possible 5. That is significantly higher than net transfer benefits, ranked at 0.61. The a priori model demonstrate that Type 1 games are the most used in cooperative games and in-game distribution, 40% of all four types of games. This is also confirmed by the random landscape model, approximately 50%. The results of the empirical data in a combination of payoff characteristics for Type 1 games show that joint and reputation benefits are critical for the success of cooperation. Practical implications - Research on cross-border learning alliances has several implications. Managerial implications can help managers to understand the challenges and benefits of engaging in these activities. They can use this knowledge to develop strategies to improve the effectiveness of their cross-border learning alliances. Practical implications, the development of game theory and cross-border models can be applied in effective decision-making in a variety of complex contexts. Learning alliances have important policy implications, particularly in trade, investment and innovation. Policymakers must consider the potential benefits and risks of these collaborations and develop policies that encourage and support them while mitigating potential negative impacts. Originality/value - International learning alliances have become a popular strategy for firms seeking to gain access to new knowledge, capabilities and markets in foreign countries. The originality of this research lies in its ability to contribute to the understanding of the dynamics and outcomes of these complex relationships in a novel and meaningful way.

AB  - Natural resources have an interest for local communities as sources for satisfying their basic needs and of additional activity. However, socio-economic and environmental changes have produced a destabilization of traditional systems, accompanied by a change in power relations between actors and dynamics of often increased resource degradation. Therefore, the concerted management of resources in the framework of development and local governance is becoming increasingly more necessary, under political and legal aspects, to ensure long-term preservation, restoration and integrated management. More widely, citizen participation and successful decentralization, therefore, are necessary conditions for endogenous and sustainable development, conditions that could be catalysed by well-targeted assistance programs. It is essential to understand the interests and limitations of participatory management for the conservation of resources. On the one hand, this type of management presents a conceptual, methodological and operational interest, facilitating institutional emergence and openness to broader development and democratization processes. On the other hand, we must not overlook serious limitations resulting from the disintegration of social organizations, delays of decentralization policies, inadequate intervention strategies, intrinsic deficits of projects, lack of consideration of the temporal and spatial framework, inadequate legal framework, inadequacy of accompanying measures, etc. These limitations can be partially corrected using procedures such as "Project Cycle Management'', procedures which allow prospective management of programs and projects and the highlighting of relevant doubts, useful for improving the likelihood of successful experiences in development.

AB  - Facing unprecedented levels of junior medical officer (JMO) vacancies, absenteeism, and burnout, the Sir Charles Gairdner Osborne Park Health Care Group (SCGOPHCG) collaborated with JMOs to create and implement the JMO Manifesto in January of 2023. With the aim of improving the organisation's attraction, recruitment, and retention of JMOs, this initiative consisted of five strategic imperatives that addressed key workplace issues affecting JMOs: (1) part-time work opportunities, (2) access to leave and (3) overtime pay, (4) limited support for workplace issues (particularly after-hours), and (5) poor workplace culture and bullying. Led by the Clinical Services team, the JMO Manifesto was an investment in building JMO wellbeing, trust, and engagement with simple but innovative strategies. The effectiveness of these strategies was evaluated by comparing pre- and post-JMO Manifesto results from routinely collected organisational data (e.g. vacancy rates) and JMO feedback through the annual Hospital Health Check survey by the Australian Medical Association. Within 6 months, the SCGOPHCG was fully recruited, had created 35 new part-time positions and new processes for managing leave, overtime claims, and support for JMOs. Eighteen months in, we remain the top-ranking public health service provider for access to leave, claiming of un-rostered overtime, workplace culture and morale, and wellbeing support for JMOs in Western Australia. The JMO Manifesto highlights the importance of healthcare organisations investing in the engagement and wellbeing of their junior doctors to achieve a sustainable medical workforce.

AB  - Purpose - Nowadays, several higher education institutions around the world are integrating sustainability topics into their daily operations, functionality and education systems. This paper presents a case study from a pilot project implemented by the Ernst-Moritz-Arndt-Universitat Greifswald (hereafter, Greifswald University), Germany on its way towards a "carbon-neutral university". The purpose of this paper is to share an institutional process targeting a gradual transformation towards achieving carbon neutrality. This might be relevant to other higher education institutions striving for a systematic and progressive change from a traditional system to a low emission or carbon-neutral pathway.
   Design/methodology/approach - To achieve carbon neutrality, three major transformative strategies were adopted: carbon reduction, carbon offsetting and mainstreaming sustainable actions via teaching and research.
   Findings - A locally adaptable institutional framework on sustainability was successfully developed to: promote changes in daily operations, implement interdisciplinary research, incorporate sustainability into teaching and education and enhance outreach programs. Strong commitment from all stakeholders resulted in reduction of the university's carbon footprint from 8,985 to 4,167 tCO(2e) year(-1). Further, the unavoidable emissions could be locally offset through enhanced carbon sequestration on the university-owned forests.
   Originality/value - Based on the experiences of Greifswald University, this paper presents major challenges and success lessons learned during the process of gradual institutional transformation to achieve the target of carbon neutrality.

AB  - Hydrological models are often linked with other models in cognate sciences to understand the interactions among climate, earth, water, ecosystem, and human society. This paper presents the development and implementation of a decision support system (DSS) that links the outputs of hydrological models with real-time decision making on social-economic assessments and land use management. Discharge and glacier geometry changes were simulated with hydrological model, water availability in semiarid environments. Irrigation and ecological water were simulated by a new commercial software MIKE HYDRO. Groundwater was simulated by MODFLOW. All the outputs of theses hydrological models were taken as inputs into the DSS in three types of links: regression equations, stationary data inputs, or dynamic data inputs as the models running parallel in the simulation periods. The DSS integrates the hydrological data, geographic data, social and economic statistical data, and establishes the relationships with equations, conditional statements and fuzzy logics. The programming is realized in C++. The DSS has four remarkable features: (1) editable land use maps to assist decision-making; (2) conjunctive use of surface and groundwater resources; (3) interactions among water, earth, ecosystem, and humans; and (4) links with hydrological models. The overall goal of the DSS is to combine the outputs of scientific models, knowledge of experts, and perspectives of stakeholders, into a computer-based system, which allows sustainability impact assessment within regional planning; and to understand ecosystem services and integrate them into land and water management.

AB  - Sustainability policies are needed to promote sustainability reporting and actions in companies, including smalland-medium-enterprises (SMEs). The purpose of this study is to provide a platform to define key actors in the development of sustainability reporting policies especially for SMEs. This study uses a qualitative approach, conducting a comprehensive internet-based literature study with the search terms "Sustainability in SMEs," "Indonesian SMEs," "CSR in SMEs," "Policies for SMEs," and "Regulations for SMEs." To leverage the research results, we conducted semi-structured interviews with the Financial Services Authority (OJK), good corporate governance forums, reporters from the Ministry of Finance, representatives from the Ministry of Cooperatives and SMEs, the Ministry of Industry, and SMEs which are the suppliers of large companies. Currently, there is no policy that actively encourages and supports SME in developing sustainability reports in Indonesia. The two most relevant regulations are 29/POJK.04/2016 and 51/POJK.03/2017, which most apply to large companies and publicly listed companies. Large companies are obliged to promote the submission of sustainability reports, unlike the SMEs. This study highlights the crucial role of sustainability reporting in promoting sustainable practices among SMEs and emphasizes the importance of enforcing laws and regulations to promote corporate social responsibility (CSR) in SMEs to achieve sustainable development goals. The findings are expected to assist relevant stakeholders in developing policies to promote sustainability reporting and practices among SMEs, not only in Indonesia but also in other countries to support stronger economic sustainability.

AB  - Background Researchers have shown an increased interest in involving professionals from outside academia in research projects. Professionals are often involved in research on ageing and health when the purpose is to address the gap between research and practice. However, there is a need to acquire more knowledge about what the involvement might lead to by exploring researchers' experiences of involving professionals in research on ageing and health and developing conceptual areas. Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify conceptual areas of professionals' involvement in research on ageing and health, from the perspective of researchers themselves. Methods Group concept mapping, a participatory and mixed method, was used to conceptualize areas. Researchers with experience of involving professionals in research projects on ageing and health participated in qualitative data collection through brainstorming sessions (n = 26), and by sorting statements (n = 27). They then took part in quantitative data collection, where they rated statements according to how much a statement strengthened research (n = 26) and strengthened practice (n = 24). Data were analysed using multidimensional scaling analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis. In addition, a qualitative analysis of the latent meaning of the cluster map was conducted. Results Analysis of the sorting stage generated five clusters illustrating conceptual areas of professionals' involvement in research projects on ageing and health. The five clusters are as follows: complex collaboration throughout the research process; adaptation of research to different stakeholders, mutual learning through partnership; applicable and sustainable knowledge; legitimate research on ageing and health. The qualitative latent meaning of the cluster map showed two themes: the process of involvement and the outcome of involvement. A positive strong correlation (0.87) was found between the rating of strengthened research and practice. Conclusions This study reveals conceptual areas on a comprehensive and illustrative map which contributes to the understanding of professionals' involvement in research on ageing and health. A conceptual basis for further studies is offered, where the aim is to investigate the processes and outcomes entailed in involving professionals in research on ageing and health. The study also contributes to the development of instruments and theories for optimizing the involvement of professionals in research.

AB  - Considering the cooperative relationship between owners and contractors in sustainable construction projects, as well as the synergistic effects created by cooperative behaviors, a cooperative incentive model was developed using game theory. The model was formulated and analyzed under both non-moral hazard and moral hazard situations. Then, a numerical simulation and example were proposed to verify the conclusions derived from the model. The results showed that the synergistic effect increases the input intensity of one party's resource transfer into the increase of marginal utility of the other party, thus the owner and contractor are willing to enhance their levels of effort. One party's optimal benefit allocation coefficient is positively affected by its own output efficiency, and negatively affected by the other party's output efficiency. The effort level and expected benefits of the owner and contractor can be improved by enhancing the cooperative relationship between the two parties, as well as enhancing the net benefits of a sustainable construction project. The synergistic effect cannot lower the negative effect of moral hazard behaviors during the implementation of sustainable construction projects. Conversely, the higher levels of the cooperative relationship, the wider the gaps amongst the optimal values under both non-moral hazard and moral hazard situations for the levels of effort, expected benefits and net project benefits. Since few studies to date have emphasized the effects of cooperative relationship on sustainable construction projects, this study constructed a game-based incentive model to bridge the gaps. This study contributes significant theoretical and practical insights into the management of cooperation amongst stakeholders, and into the enhancement of the overall benefits of sustainable construction projects.

AB  - The construction industry in China is trying very hard to achieve sustainable development. Meanwhile, it is important to balance the pursuit of stakeholders and addresses the obstacles encountered by these stakeholders. There are few studies that have comprehensively discussed how to combine co-benefits with stakeholder theory to tackle conflicts of interests and achieve co-benefits in Chinese construction industry. This study adopts grey theory to collect and integrate professional suggestions from different experts into indexes that can be compared and analyzed. Then, Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution is used to rank the stakeholders as well as criteria for selecting the optimum alternative, and uses the crawler technology to gain each criterion's weight for each stakeholder. Our research results show that the stakeholders of suppliers, firms, and the sustainable community are deemed to have priority to achieve co-benefits. The main criteria to consider in achieving co-benefits are transferring technology developments, respecting cultural habitats and traditions, and environment pollution controls. The main contributions are as follows: (1) theoretically, the basis for stakeholders to estimate the co-benefits was obtained (2) the corresponding mixed method to conduct the assessment was developed in Chinse construction industry.

AB  - As a characteristic new means for China to curb the excessive and disordered expansion of construction land, Construction Land Reduction (CLR) plays a significant role in achieving the sustainable use of land resources in economic, ecological and social terms. However, frequent value conflicts inevitably arise over diverse value appeals of various stakeholders throughout all phases of CLR projects, which has greatly impeded the effective implementation of CLR projects in China. To systematically recognize and strategically coordinate stakeholder value conflicts regarding multidimensional dynamic values under limited management resources and insufficient project experience, this study proposes an integrated SA (stakeholder analysis) SNA (social network analysis) TRIZ (theory of inventive problem solving) approach built on a systematic framework for stakeholder value conflict management. An empirical study on Shanghai's CLR projects is conducted to demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of the proposed approach. A total of 280 pairs of value conflicts over 53 value appeals of 11 stakeholders are identified during the four phases of CLR projects in the SA-based conflict identification process, with 4 key value appeals and 21 key value conflicts prioritized in the SNA-based criticality evaluation process. Through the TRIZ-based strategy proposal process, 31 targeted coordination strategies are proposed, from which six major managerial and policy implications for CLR can be distilled. Methodologically, this study contributes to conflict management research by providing an integrated SA-SNA-TRIZ approach with a novel systematic methodological framework. Practically, the research outcomes provide policy makers and practitioners with useful new insights into managing stakeholder value conflicts, thereby driving successful project implementation and facilitating sustainability practices.

AB  - Over the last decade, various governments and supranational bodies have promoted the development of a circular bioeconomy (CBE) as a response to sustainability challenges. The transition towards a CBE requires the collaboration of different actors in the innovation (eco)system. With this conceptual paper, we apply a circular business model lens to address the research question: "What are the archetypical roles of consumers in business model innovations for a sustainable CBE?" We use a combination of complementary theories from the circular economy and bioeconomy literature, evolutionary innovation economics, sustainability transitions research, the business model literature, and the work on active consumers. Considering consumers' agency as a continuum between the manufacturer-active paradigm and the consumer-active paradigm, we propose: (i) consumers in the manufacturer-active paradigm can actively influence circular business models with their purchase decision; (ii) consumers can act as lobbyists and influencers for circular business model innovation; (iii) in their different roles as customer, user, repairer, and reseller, consumers can incentivize organizations to adapt their business models to their needs; (iv) consumers can become key partners in the process of defining the normative orientation of the innovation paradigm for a CBE; (v) consumers can actively co-create value by means of co-ownership (e.g., through platform cooperatives).

AB  - Geotourism focuses on an areas' geodiversity and cultural landscape to provide visitor engagement, learning, and enjoyment. Geotourism is pivotal in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), as recognised by the United Nations. This study examines the development of the Australian Geotourism Discovery Portal (AGDP) and its role in promoting sustainable geotourism, aligned with Australia's National Geotourism Strategy strategic goals, and in providing a framework for the development of digital platforms for geotourism. The AGDP's development was guided by a deductive development approach to examine the link between Geographical Information Technologies (GITs) and SDGs and subsequently applying findings to a stakeholder-led design process aligned with the needs of identified putative user groups. With a focus on two key user groups, the 'Grey Nomads' and 'Students & Educators', we used our deductive approach to iteratively test and refine the platform's development based on the key attributes and preferences of these user groups for different accessibility, educational, and experiential needs. The AGDP employed ESRI ArcGIS Hub Web-GIS technology to promote geosites, geotrails, mining sites, indigenous cultural heritage sites, and GeoRegions in Australia. The implementation of the AGDP highlighted the potential to enhance public understanding of Australia's natural and cultural heritage and the significant opportunity to leverage emerging GITs in maintaining the sustainable development initiatives of the geotourism sector. The framework established provides a replicable model that can be adapted and applied to other regions around the world, offering a tool and process development that can be used in a range of stakeholder- and community-led sustainable development initiatives.

AB  - Due to the world wide degradation of river catchments and their related aquatic resources the development of integrated management strategies has become an important issue. Tools and processes are required that support the integration of science, the needs of stakeholders and the local population, within existing political frameworks to achieve a sustainable catchment development. In this paper the potential of qualitative reasoning (QR) models for sustainable catchment management is evaluated by students and domain experts. This evaluation yields promising results. The evaluated QR models were found to represent complex knowledge in an understandable manner. Most people 'largely or fully agreed' that the presented QR models may significantly contribute to the understanding of students and stakeholders, concerning which entities and processes drive a sustainable development of a riverine landscape, and therefore enhances their decision-making capabilities. Due to its potential to integrate quantitative and qualitative knowledge, to build causal models, and to run dynamic simulations, the presented QR approach has great potential to become an important contribution to integrated catchment management at multiple levels of the implementation process thereof (such as education, decision-making, social learning, integration of different scientific disciplines, and communication).

AB  - There is a growing interest in how entrepreneurship animates deliberate sustainability transformations across societal levels. Few studies, however, have provided an empirically grounded account of practices employed by sustainability-driven entrepreneurial organizations for sustainability transformations. We address this gap by applying the critical Human Resource Development (CHRD) framework to identify practices for developing organizational and community capacity conducive to sustainability transformations in two cases of sustainability-driven entrepreneurship in the UNESCO World Heritage Site Serra da Capivara National Park, Brazil. We used case study methodology to identify five practices by conducting a reflexive thematic analysis with qualitative data from key informant interviews, documents, and secondary sources. Our results show that each practice was strongly oriented by relational values of care and social-ecological systems thinking. Both humans and nonhumans were taken as stakeholders who participate in and benefit from practices. Caring for the local place, place-based learning, and regenerative organizing appeared to be relevant for learning and development interventions that imparted significant changes in the local social-ecological context. We updated the CHRD framework to incorporate a nonhuman dimension and highlight caring, place-based learning, and regenerative organizing as essential areas of engagement in which HRD practices in support of place-based sustainability transformations occur.

AB  - An enduring challenge for environmental governance is how to coordinate multiple actors to achieve more collaborative and holistic management of complex socio-ecological systems. Catchment partnerships are often thought able to achieve this, so here we ask: do such partnerships actually help navigate complexity, or merely add to it? We answer this question by analysing the experiences of four voluntary UK catchment partnerships. Our data combined a structured desk-based analysis of partnership documents, with semi-structured interviews with partnership coordinators, chairs and partner representatives. These data were analysed using a qualitative thematic approach informed by the literatures on catchment management and collaborative governance of complexity. We found that partnerships both add to and help navigate the complexity of holistic and inclusive environmental management. Maintaining partnerships entails costs for partners, and partnerships connect messily and multitudinously to other initiatives. However, the partnerships were all judged as worthwhile, and made progress towards goals for water quality, biodiversity and river restoration. They were especially valued for envisioning and initiating complex activities such as Natural Flood Management. Communication and networking by partnership coordinators and partners underpinned these achievements. Aspects of pre-existing governance systems both enabled and constrained the partnerships: in particular, statutory agencies responsible for policy delivery were always important partners, and delivering partnership plans often depended on public-sector grants. This draws attention to the pervasive effect of governmentality in collaborative governance. More attention to analysing-and supporting-such partnerships is worthwhile, complemented by reflection on the limits to environmental governance in the face of complexity.

AB  - Coastal marine environments provide livelihoods as billions of people around the world depend greatly on sustainability efforts in the Blue Economy. In this study, we investigated how stakeholders from important Blue Economy sectors along the German North Sea coast perceive the impacts of climate change on their daily work life and the growth of the Blue Economy. In a two-stage approach we first conducted two stakeholder workshops with representatives from the regional sea food sector, science, NGOs and local authorities, in order to identify important issues linked to climate change affecting environment, society, economy and policy. In the second stage, we conducted semi-structured interviews with key knowledge holders from the Blue Economy, to evaluate and validate the most important issues identified during the first stage, and the impacts on the respective sectors. The workshop participants identified perceptible effects of climate change on their marine environment. Early career scientists showed that they possess a clear focus on measures for climate change adaptation, transdisciplinary approaches and knowledge transfer. The interviews revealed that the climate change effects could be perceived as both negative and positive, depending on the sector. Other issues, especially political decisions and developments are perceived to have a greater immediate impact on the Blue Economy than the slow progress of climate change effects. Additionally, increased human activities, in the form of new or intensified uses like marine renewable energy generation, have a greater influence and lead to conflicts between the Blue Economy sectors. Our study showed that economic and societal stakeholders in Germanys North Sea region are aware of climate change and already perceive its effects on their businesses. Synergies and conflicts between the sectors and political decisions might influence sustainable growth of the Blue Economy in highly contested regions, such as the North Sea basin, much stronger than the effects of climate change. This calls for a more flexible and adaptive approach to policymaking, taking into account the changing environmental, social and economic realities.

AB  - Sustainable agriculture is crucial for meeting the growing global food demand. With the pressure of climate change, resource depletion, and the need for increased agricultural productivity, innovative approaches are essential. Nanotechnology is an emerging technology in achieving sustainable development goals (SDGs). Despite its promising benefits, the safe implementation of nanotechnology in agriculture requires careful consideration of potential health and environmental risks. However, there is a lack of comprehensive documentation on the application, potential and limitations of nanotechnology in the field of agriculture. To address this gap, a desk research approach was used by utilizing peer-reviewed electronic databases like PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and Science Direct for relevant articles. Out of 157 initially identified articles, 85 were deemed pertinent, focusing primarily on potential nanotechnology in smart agricultural systems. Taking into account research findings worldwide, we found significant improvements with nanotechnology over traditional methods which underscores the practical benefits of nanotechnology, including increased crop yields, efficient resource use, and reduced environmental footprint. The objective of this systematic review is to explore the nexus between nanotechnology and agricultural systems, highlighting its potential to enhance productivity, sustainability, and resilience and to inform researchers, practitioners, and policymakers about the transformative impact of nanotechnology on sustainable agriculture and underscores the need for further research to address safety concerns and maximize its potential for agricultural advancement.
   A thorough study of nanotechnology's new method to lessen fertilizer and pesticide harmful impacts and their responsibilities. Developing an integrated approach for smart farming systems. A guide for future nanotechnology studies in agriculture suggests breakthroughs in biotic and abiotic remediation using nano-particles for a safe climate change scenario.

AB  - Solar PV technology holds significant potential for addressing energy access issues in rural Zambia. However, adoption rates remain low despite numerous interventions. This study explores the impact of community-based interventions, leveraging local networks, individual benefits, and peer consultation, on accelerating PV adoption and willingness to pay. The primary aim is to understand how social and individual benefits influence PV adoption intention and examine the relationship between visual exposure to solar technology and adoption intention. The research seeks to inform policies and interventions that promote sustainable energy access and socio-economic development in rural Zambia and similar contexts. Over 6 months, a qualitative study was conducted involving 58 interviews, 7 focus group discussions, pictorial evidence, and observational techniques. The study engaged 120 rural subsistence farmers and 16 commercial farmers across three regions of Zambia, using five local languages. The research employed the Rural Development Stakeholder Hybrid Adoption Model (RUDSHAM) that was developed for this research, which combines the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), and Diffusion of Innovations (DOI) theory. Findings reveal that shifting individual and community mindsets is crucial for project sustainability. Emphasizing individual benefits leads to broader community advantages as participation increases. Additionally, PV adoption and willingness to pay can be catalysed through systematic knowledge dissemination and leveraging peer and social influence. The study highlights the need for donors to deepen their understanding of poverty to make effective interventions. These insights provide a foundation for developing targeted strategies to enhance PV adoption in rural settings.

AB  - Purpose - Colleges and universities increasingly have the mandate and motivation to integrate sustainability into their curricula. The purpose of this paper is to share the strategy used at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn) and provide an evaluation of its success and guidance to others creating similar programs.
   Design/methodology/approach - This article summarizes Penn's Integrating Sustainability Across the Curriculum (ISAC) program. ISAC pairs Penn undergraduate research assistants with instructors in a collaborative effort to incorporate sustainability into courses.
   Findings - In concert with other Penn initiatives (a course inventory, faculty discussion groups and a research network), ISAC increases Penn's sustainability-related courses and creates dialogue regarding how various disciplines contribute to sustainability.
   Practical implications - The program described in this article is replicable at other institutions. The authors demonstrate that the logistics of recruiting students and establishing the program are straightforward. Undergraduate students are on campus; their pay requirements are modest; and they are desirous of such research experiences.
   Social implications - The ISAC program inculcates a cultural and behavioral shift as students and faculty approach sustainability issues collaboratively, and it facilitates the development of a shared language of environmental sustainability. Such social implications are difficult to quantify, but are nonetheless valuable outcomes.
   Originality/value - The faculty-student partnership used to facilitate the integration of sustainability into courses at Penn is original. The ISAC program provides a framework for engaging students and faculty in curriculum development around sustainability in a manner that benefits the student research assistants, the participating faculty and future students.

AB  - The way we see ourselves and understand the world we live in guides and determines the types of solutions we are designing and implementing to deal with our global change problems. System thinking is helping us to recognize humanity as complex, self-organized, multi-level, and highly integrated socio-bio-physical entities that we refer to as socioecosystems. This new ontological paradigm requires new epistemological tools, and transdisciplinary research is inducing changes in different aspects of our scientific endeavor, including: the philosophical approach we use to observe our world; the level of commitment we put in our scientific work; the extent and scope we envision in our research goals; the geographical scale and context in which we focus our case-studies; the type of collaboration we engage in with other scientists; and the institutional arrangements we construct to accomplish our research efforts. The International Long Term Ecological Research Network (ILTER) includes national-level networks of scientists engaged and committed to conducting long-term and site-based ecological and socio-economic research and monitoring, with a strong interest in capacity building. ILTER members have expertise in the collection, management, and analysis of long-term environmental data and, together, they are responsible for creating and maintaining a large number of unique long-term datasets. ILTER has been a natural partner for global initiatives dealing with environmental issues, and many members of its community have been participating in these international programs. We should not underestimate the urgency, nor the level of commitment, required to foster worldwide socioecosystem research with a transdisciplinary approach, which are essential for the success of the sustainable Earth Stewardship initiative.

AB  - (1) Background: There is a global trend to stimulate sustainable urbanization by updating the hardware of the built environment with green technologies. However, simply greening the city hardware does not ensure a sustainable urban system. In reality, urban communities, as cells of the city, play a crucial role in the sustainable development of the entire city. (2) Methods: This paper conducts a case study by investigating a community in Taipei with semi-structured interviews and other first-hand data. It examines how self-organization, voluntary groups, and the public participation of community members has successfully institutionalized a governing system for the sustainable development of communities; (3) Results: This paper identifies the major actors and mechanisms underpinning the sustainable development of urban communities with a case study in Taipei. The establishment of this more cost-effective form of community governance will possibly provide more benefits to community members; (4) Conclusions: This case study will shed light on the sustainable development of urban community in many other cities, offering possible pathways and epitome for self-organization of urban community in the coming era. Its cost-effective institutional design contributes greatly to sustainable community development, partly solving the current failure to promote urban sustainability.

KW  - Environmental sustainability
AB  - This study provides a sociological investigation into the interconnected dynamics of green human resource management practices (GHRM), green transformational leadership (GTL), employees' pro-environmental behaviors (EPB), green culture (GC), and environmental sustainability (ES) within the context of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Lahore and Faisalabad, Pakistan. Utilizing a sample of 357 participants, comprising HR managers, leaders, and employees within SMEs, data were collected through self-report measures, and analysis was conducted using Smart PLS 4.0 software. The results underscore the positive impact of GHRM on EPB and ES through serial mediation of EPB and GC within SMEs, emphasizing the role of GHRM in cultivating pro-environmental attitudes among employees and enhancing overall environmental sustainability. However, the correlation between GHRM and the development of GC was found to be insignificant, suggesting the need to explore additional variables for fostering a green culture within organizations. Furthermore, the study reveals that EPB serves as a partial mediator between GHRM and both ES and GC. Notably, green transformational leadership (GTL) did not exhibit a significant moderating effect on the relationship between GHRM and EPB. This research provides valuable insights for organizations seeking to enhance environmental sustainability by promoting pro-environmental behaviors among employees and emphasizes the importance of cultivating a pervasive green culture to fully leverage the potential of GHRM practices. Despite acknowledging limitations such as a singular country focus and reliance on self-reported data, this study contributes to a deeper understanding of these phenomena within the sociocultural context of SMEs, thus augmenting the existing literature. Practical Implications: This study provides practical guidance for HR professionals and organizational leaders in the SME sector looking to implement strategic Green HRM interventions. By recognizing the positive impact of Green HRM practices on pro-environmental behavior and environmental sustainability, organizations can develop specific initiatives to encourage environmentally responsible behavior among their employees. Moreover, the research underscores the importance of cultivating a green organizational culture through the promotion of pro-environmental behavior and green initiatives. Organizations can use these insights to design awareness campaigns, training programs, and workshops that instill a sense of environmental responsibility, ultimately fostering a culture of sustainability. A significant practical implication of this study is the emphasis on employee engagement and empowerment in driving sustainability initiatives. By involving employees in decision-making processes and providing opportunities for them to participate in green projects, organizations can tap into their enthusiasm and commitment toward environmental sustainability. Additionally, the research explores Green Transformational Leadership as a moderator, opening avenues for leadership development programs that highlight environmentally conscious leadership practices. This approach allows organizations to nurture leaders who actively support and advocate for sustainability, positively influencing employees' proenvironmental behavior. Furthermore, the study encourages SMEs to adopt and integrate environmentally sustainable practices into their business operations.
   Implementing eco-friendly processes, resource conservation measures and waste reduction initiatives can help align their business goals with environmental sustainability objectives. This not only benefits the environment but also leads to cost savings, increased efficiency, and enhanced organizational resilience. The practical implications extend to policymakers and regulatory bodies as well, emphasizing the importance of formulating environmentally friendly policies and regulations that incentivize and support Green HRM practices in the SME sector. This approach encourages organizations to voluntarily adopt sustainable practices, aligning them with national and global environmental targets. Another significant benefit highlighted in the research is that embracing sustainability practices can enhance an organization's reputation as a socially responsible entity. Demonstrating commitment to environmental sustainability can attract environmentally conscious customers, investors, and partners, creating a positive impact on the organization's brand image and market competitiveness. Moreover, the study fosters collaboration and knowledge sharing among organizations within the SME sector. This sharing of best practices, challenges, and successes in implementing Green HRM strategies promotes a collective effort towards sustainability. Lastly, the study underscores the importance of engaging various stakeholders, including employees, customers, suppliers, and local communities, in sustainability initiatives. Organizations can collaborate with these stakeholders to collectively address environmental challenges and develop innovative solutions. In a nutshell, by adopting Green HRM practices and fostering a culture of environmental responsibility, SMEs can achieve long-term sustainable growth. These practical implications equip organizations with actionable strategies to promote environmental sustainability, making a meaningful contribution towards a greener and more sustainable future for the SME sector and beyond.

AB  - Scenario development has been recognized as a potential method to explore future change and stimulate a reflective process that can contribute to more informed decision-making. The assessment process under IPBES (the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services) has however shown that the current predominantly biophysical and economic models and scenario processes for exploring the future of biodiversity, ecosystem services and their contributions to human wellbeing are insufficient to capture the complexity and context-specific nature of the problems facing these sectors. Several important challenges have been identified that require a more in-depth analysis of where more imaginative scenario efforts can be undertaken to address this gap. In this paper, we identify six key characteristics necessary for scenario processes: adaptability across diverse contexts, inclusion of diverse knowledge and value systems, legitimate stakeholder engagement that foregrounds the role of power and politics, an ability to grapple with uncertainty, individual and collective thinking mechanisms and relevance to policy making. We compared four cases of imaginative, arts-based scenario processes that each offer aspects of meeting these criteria. These approaches emphasise the importance of engaging the imagination of those involved in a process and harnessing it as a tool for identifying and conceptualising more transformative future trajectories. Drawing on the existing literature, we argue that there is value in fostering more inclusive and creative participatory processes that acknowledge the importance of understanding multiple value systems and relationships in order to reimagine a more inclusive and just future. Based on this, we reflect on future research to understand the transformative role that imagination can play in altering and enhancing knowledge-making for global assessments, including IPBES. We conclude that creative scenario co-development processes that promote imagination and create an opening for more empathetic responses should be considered as complementary tools within the suite of methodologies used for future IPBES scenario development.

AB  - The need to develop successful collaborative strategies is an enduring problem in sustainable resource management. Our goal is to evaluate the relationship between information networks and conflict in the context of collaborative groundwater management in the rapidly growing central highland region of Arizona. In this region, water-management conflicts have emerged because of stakeholders' differing geographic perspectives and competing scientific claims. Using social network analyses, we explored the extent to which the Verde River Basin Partnership (VRBP), which was charged with developing and sharing scientific information, has contributed to collaboration in the region. To accomplish this, we examined the role that this stakeholder partnership plays in reinforcing or overcoming the geographic, ideological, expert, and power conflicts among its members. Focusing on information sharing, we tested the extent to which several theoretically important elements of successful collaboration were evidenced by data from the VRBP. The structure of information sharing provides insight into ways in which barriers between diverse perspectives might be retained and elucidates weaknesses in the partnership. To characterize information sharing, we examined interaction ties among individuals with different geographic concerns, hierarchical scales of interest, belief systems (about science, the environment, and the role of the partnership), and self-identified expertise types. Results showed that the partnership's information-sharing network spans most of these boundaries. Based on current theories of collaboration, we would expect the partnership network to be conducive to collaboration. We found that information exchanges are limited by differences in connection patterns across actor expertise and environmental-belief systems. Actors who view scientists as advocates are significantly more likely to occupy boundary-spanning positions, that appear to impede the success of the partnership. This analysis challenges widely held assumptions about the properties that separate successful collaborations from those that are less successful. It has implications for our understanding of the factors that constrain information processing, knowledge production, and collective-action capability in institutions.

AB  - Core characteristics of Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) procedures along with the quality of implementation vary from country to country and sometimes from project to project. However, several issues obstructing EIA's proper implementation are common, such as: national or regional EIA specific regulations, low quality of assessment reports, insufficient equipment and trained staff, inadequate institutional framework, lack of public participation, and low levels of cooperation between policymakers, researchers, and stakeholders. The gap between EIA research and practice is often highlighted in the scientific literature and technical reports; however, data is often limited to particular cases. This paper explores researchers' perspectives on the main strengths and weaknesses of EIA so we may advance recommendations to improve the quality and effectiveness of EIA procedures for more sustainable outcomes. We applied an online survey on EIA strengths and weaknesses to researchers that published at least one paper related to EIA in the last ten years. We use different statistical analyses, network analysis and co-occurrence analysis to investigate the 103 responses received from researchers in the field. Our findings capture researchers' perspectives and could help to change our current traditional approaches. Our results could also help us rethink the EIA collaborative process leading it toward more sustainable holistic planning by learning from past experiences, best practices, and expert opinion.

AB  - Food losses and waste (FLW) have multidimensional environmental, social, and economic impacts, and avoidance efforts may yield better environmental gains than recovery. Horticulture has the highest FLW (approximate to 50% of production loss), representing 38% of total global FLW. The primary data were collected from 343 grape farmers and middlemen in Egypt, and the life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology and the Category Method (C-Method) have been employed to estimate the percentage of Postharvest Losses (PHL) and its socio-economic and environmental effects across the supply chain (SC). Empirical findings show average PHL percentages of 10.06%, 5.82%, 6.53%, and 7.06% for growers, rural traders, wholesalers, and retailers. The total arable land, water, and energy consumed to grow this lost food are estimated at around 23 thousand hectares, 158 million m3, and 3.16 billion MJ of fossil energy (96.9 million liters of petrol), besides other agricultural inputs. This costs the economy of Egypt about $203.5 million yearly and emits 145 million tons of CO2eq. These findings highlight the significant role of cooperative marketing, shorter supply chains, and access to cold shipping, handling, and storage services to sustain product quality. Furthermore, agricultural education and extension are necessary to disseminate the best postharvest practices to increase stakeholders' knowledge and sustainably enhance SC actors' skills for using limited resources. These interventions require intensive public-private investment to incentivize small stakeholders to mitigate PHLs, accelerate food system transformation, and achieve sustainable production and consumption patterns.

AB  - Different types of spatial knowledge (expert, sectoral, tacit and community) are strategic resources in urban planning and management. Participatory spatial knowledge management is a major method for eliciting various types of knowledge, providing a platform for knowledge integration and informing local action and public policy. Knowledge types linked to a specific geographical locality can be integrated through geographical information systems. Recent developments in geographical information and communication technology (geoICT) have extended the opportunities for participatory spatial knowledge production, use and exchange. However, data reliability of user-generated content, social exclusion due to dependence on technology and the interpretation and implications of digital maps are major concerns. The challenge is how to integrate and utilize multiple knowledge sources for improving urban management and governance. This paper integrates the literature on knowledge types and knowledge production processes with available geoICT tools for the production, use and exchange of knowledge sources and applies it to examples from Asia, Africa and Latin America. From this review, we provide a heuristic framework for assessing the extent to which participatory spatial knowledge management tools can be instrumental on several fronts. We argue that technological developments of knowledge production have not fully addressed important issues related to accountability, empowerment, control and use of knowledge. Moreover, these developments may foster social exclusion, which could detract from the benefits of participatory spatial knowledge management in the context of urban sustainability.

AB  - Purpose - This study aims to review the zeal exhibited by universities in South Africa towards aligning institutional mandates of teaching, learning, research and community engagement to the sustainable development (SD) agenda. The implementation of the SD agenda across higher education institutions (HEIs) continues to draw attention from the wider society. This is because HEIs are increasingly being looked up to for leadership in this regard. However, although several studies are quick to identify various factors which have driven the adoption of sustainable practices in HEIs, the paucity of studies seeking to identify the drivers for SD implementation remains glaring. This is particularly so in developing countries like South Africa.
   Design/methodology/approach - To confirm the exploratory data from desktop study on public university engagement with sustainability in South Africa, a single case study was conducted in the Central University of Technology (CUT). The single case study design adopted semi-structured interviews and document reviews as data collection techniques. Purposive snowballing sampling technique was strictly adhered to in the selection of interviewees. Interviewees were selected on the basis of their roles in the implementation of the CUT's sustainability agenda.
   Findings - Data emanating from these interviews were analysed thematically using qualitative content analysis. Although a plethora of drivers were identified, there appeared to be a consensus between most of the interviewees that the quest for cost reduction remained the most significant driver for the viable implementation of the sustainability agenda at CUT.
   Research limitations/implications - It is expected that findings from this study would provide a platform for the development of effective implementation strategies in South African HEIs. Also, the findings contribute to filing the extant gap observed concerning implementation and drivers for engendering SD implementation in HEIs in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) region.
   Practical implications - By highlighting the drivers for SD implementation, this study contributes to the development of a more receptive social ontology among various stakeholders in an HEI towards the agenda, particularly within the SSA context where there is low level of awareness and buy-in by these stakeholders.
   Originality/value - This study makes an original contribution to the research base of SD in HEIs and implementation.

AB  - This article presents the background to and rationale for a practice-focused model of educational change and improvement. In contrast to autocratic top-down models, this democratic and pragmatic approach begins with the educational concerns of teachers. In this model, responsibility and accountability for educational improvement is shared between policy professionals, the university team and sector practitioners. Contributions from the literature explore the question of the nature and purpose of educational practice; how concepts of educational practice influence curriculum design and content in programmes for the initial and continuing professional development for teachers of vocational education; and how these can enhance or inhibit the improvement of educational practice. Drawing upon case study examples from a national programme of university-supported practitioner research in England, results illustrate how this model offers insights into ways of increasing research capacity and achieving sustainable improvements in educational practice. It concludes that programmes of university-supported practitioner research, which encourage and enable teachers to engage in the systematic investigation of educational practice, can realize educational improvements which other approaches to educational evaluation and improvement (including external inspection regimes) struggle to do. It invites politicians and policy professionals to consider potential applications of this approach in other national systems of vocational education.

AB  - While governments around the world are embarking on the path to recovery from the COVID-19 crisis, sustainable tourism planning is crucial, in particular in the hospitality sector, which enhances the resilience of destinations. However, many destination management models overlook the role of urban zoning. Little is known about the impacts of land-use zoning on the hospitality and property industries, especially with the current disruption of short-term peer-to-peer accommodation like Airbnb. Euclidean zoning, also known as effects-based planning, has long been criticised in destination management for its exclusionary nature and lack of flexibility. With exclusionary zoning, property owners may only be able to use their land sub-optimally, and cities will be less efficient in responding to market changes in short-term and long-term accommodation demands, but planning intentions can be better controlled, and the property supply can be more stable. Taking Hong Kong as a noteworthy case, this study puts forward a conceptual framework that enables comparison of a novel zoning approach with the traditional zoning approach. This novel zoning approach encompasses both the short- and long-term rental sectors as a continuum of accommodation, ranging from hotels and serviced apartments to Airbnb and rental housing units under a unified regulatory and planning regime to enhance the switching options value. This novel zoning system can gear up the tourism sector with the rapid growth of the sharing economy and aligns with sustainable tourism to ensure long-term socioeconomic benefits to related stakeholders. We extract the data of Airbnb listings to construct the first Airbnb ADR Index (ADRI) by Repeat-sales method, and the results support our Switching Option Hypothesis.

AB  - The University of Guayaquil, which shares the same name as the city where it is located, faces the challenge of its image transformation for the 21st century. It was deemed necessary to identify details about the urban evolution of the city over time, in relation to the changes produced by the project's site and its direct area of influence. The goal is to integrate the main university campus within a framework which guarantees sustainability and allows innovation in the living lab. To achieve this, the action research method was applied, focused on the community participation and the logic framework. The proposal, the management model, and the integrated working groups were organized with internal users such as professors, students, and university authorities, and external actors such as residents, local business communities, Guayaquil city council, and its local mayor and governor. As result of the diagnosis, six different analysis dimensions were established which correspond to the new urban agenda for the future campus: compactness, inclusiveness, resilience, sustainability, safety, and participation. As a proposal, the urban design integrates the analysis of the dimensions whose financial support and execution are given by the municipality authorities that integrates the campus with its network of community police headquarters.

AB  - Local energy communities (LECs), as locally and collectively organized mull-energy systems, are expected to play an important role in energy transition, since they enable deployment of sustainable energy technologies and consumer engagement, bringing various benefits to the community users and contributing to the overall energy and climate objectives. An LEC may consist of multiple distributed energy systems (DESs), which, interconnected through local grid and heating network, can share power and thermal energy with no costs for community's users. This paper focuses on stochastic daily operation optimization of multiple DESs with renewables in an LEC. The problem is to find the optimized operation strategies of energy devices in each DES, and decide the amount of electrical and thermal energy to be shared among DESs with the objective to minimize the total expected net energy and CO2 emission cost of the LEC, while meeting given day-ahead demand of community's users. The problem is challenging because of the intermittent and uncertain nature of renewable generation and the coupling of energy devices and energy processes intra and inter DESs. To address these issues, a stochastic mixedinteger linear programming model is established with uncertain renewable generation modeled by a Markovian process to avoid the difficulties and drawbacks associated with scenario-based methods. The problem is solved by using branch-and-cut. Numerical testing results show that the total expected cost of the LEC is reduced by the integrated management of the DESs as compared to the costs attained under other operation modes where there are no interconnections among DESs, demonstrating the potential benefits that can be achieved with LECs through the optimized management of local energy resources aiming to foster efficient use of the available energy. Results also highlight the benefits of the stochastic approach as compared with the deterministic one.

AB  - Extending last-mile delivery services to individuals-crowdshippers who pick up or deliver a shipment as part of their daily activities-has sustainable benefits, but also risks (damaged parcels, late deliveries, increased emissions) for various stakeholders. So far, developed crowdshipping models have only addressed one or two risks at a time. No model promotes environmental goals separately or together with other goals. This study proposes a crowdshipping model that consists of three stakeholders (the owner of a crowdshipping platform, crowdshippers and parcel providers) and with various incentives aims to maximise the profitability of the platform and the compensation of crowdshippers, the quality of delivery, and to minimise environmental externalities. A two-level leader-follower game and the concept of Shapley value, from cooperative flow games at the follower level, are used to define the optimal strategy that provides sustainable delivery with a good balance between costs and profits. The game behaviour was explained on a crowdshipping platform provider (leader) and two coalitions: individual crowdshippers and parcel logistics providers. The aim of the example is to explain the strategy of promoting environmentally friendly parcel delivery. The results show satisfactory economic, social and environmental performance.

KW  - DISTRICT
AB  - Background
   The resistance to insecticides among malaria vectors poses a global challenge in the efforts towards malaria elimination. This calls for an addition of larval control methods such as biolarviciding. However, the implementation of biolarviciding in Tanzania has been very low. Therefore, this study explored factors affecting the implementation of biolarviciding in the councils of Southern Tanzania.
   Methods
   A mixed method descriptive qualitative, cross-sectional study design was used to collect data from 32 community leaders through key informant interviews and 12 Vectors Control Coordinators through in-depth interviews and questionnaire interviews and document review of implementation reports in 12 councils. Data were analysed using ATLAS.ti version 8, where content analysis was performed and SPSS for the quantitative data.
   Results
   The study found low implementation of biolarviciding intervention in 9 out of 12 (75%) surveyed councils. All Vector Control Coordinators reported a shortage of at least one type of resources: funds, trained personnel, transport, supply of biolarvicide, and equipment; low community involvement (50%) and low level of community participation 83.3% (10/12).
   Conclusion
   This study highlights resource inadequacy and low community participation as main barriers to the implementation of biolarviciding. Availing adequate resources and strengthening community participation through involvement in all stages of implementation is crucial for successful and sustainable implementation.

AB  - Background: As an interdisciplinary research area at the interface of management theory, psychology, sociology, social anthropology, and cultural studies, organizational behavior (OB) still lacks a clear definition, whereas its status and scope have not been precisely determined. Some experts believe that the knowledge of all possible instances of OB and its constant improvement is the key to the proper calibration of management techniques, organizational dynamics, and more active staff. Others stress that OB has lost its significance and authority as an academic discipline. Purpose: The goal of the research is to develop an approach that complements and further develops concepts comprising OB theory as regards the identification of micro-, meso-, and macro-organizational behavior actors - individuals, groups, teams, the organization itself, and its external stakeholders. Study design/methodology/approach: The authors provide a solid framework for the principle of methodological isomorphism and its application to the indicators of OB - measures of organizational actions. Further, a possibility for the methodological integration of tools for managing the OB of all categories of actors is demonstrated. Findings/conclusions: An original definition of OB management is offered and justified. The focus is on the strategic context of efforts to improve OB. A strategy map used in OB management is provided as an illustration. It is concluded that the sustainable success of an organization heavily depends on how stakeholders (actors) perceive the efforts of the management to enhance working conditions and the organizational culture of the work environment, as well as to strengthen the market leadership of the organization. Limitations/future research: The research limitations lie in the scope of methodological challenges which need to be solved. New approaches to monitoring, analyzing, and evaluating the measurement results are going to be proposed and researched. The methodology and relevant calculations for perception indicators computation are going to be explored.

AB  - The oceans face a range of complex challenges for which the impacts on society are highly uncertain but mostly negative. Tackling these challenges is testing society's capacity to mobilise transformative action, engendering a sense of powerlessness. Envisaging positive but realistic visions of the future, and considering how current knowledge, resources, and technology could be used to achieve these futures, may lead to greater action to achieve sustainable transformations. Future Seas (www.FutureSeas2030.org) brought together researchers across career stages, Indigenous Peoples and environmental managers to develop scenarios for 12 challenges facing the oceans, leveraging interdisciplinary knowledge to improve society's capacity to purposefully shape the direction of marine socialecological systems over the UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development (2021- 2030). We describe and reflect on Future Seas, providing guidance for co-developing scenarios in interdisciplinary teams tasked with exploring ocean futures. We detail the narrative development for two futures: our current trajectory based on published evidence, and a more sustainable future, consistent with the UN's Sustainable Development Goals, which is technically achievable using existing and emerging knowledge. Presentation of Business-as-usual and More Sustainable futures-together-allows communication of both trajectories, whilst also highlighting achievable, sustainable versions of the future. The advantages of the interdisciplinary approach taken include: (1) integrating different perspectives on solutions, (2) capacity to explore interactions between Life Under Water (Goal 14) and other SDGs, and (3) cross-disciplinary learning. This approach allowed participants to conceptualise shared visions of the future and codesign transformative pathways to achieving those futures.

AB  - Sister city cooperation based on common historical and cultural ties between Tanjungpinang, Indonesia and Johor Bahru, Malaysia provides a strategic opportunity to enhance socio-cultural interaction and encourage tourism. This research aims to find opportunities for sister city collaboration and the types of activities that are included in the scope of cooperation between the two cities. The method used in this research is descriptive with a qualitative approach by collecting various data, including official government documents, local demographic statistics, sociocultural characteristics, economic situation, development plans, and public and government views regarding social and development activities. To analyze the phenomena that occur, the theory of liberalism is used which states that a country can achieve political and economic goals through cooperation and promoting individual freedom and social justice. The results of this study indicate that the collaboration can be an effective platform for the exchange of knowledge, practices and resources between the two cities, and can also expand the network of partners involved in inclusive education. The study concluded that there are still several challenges such as limited resources, lack of public awareness and understanding, and structural barriers that can affect the effectiveness of implementing this collaborative effort. Thus, an active and collaborative role is needed from state and non-state actors to achieve sustainable economic and tourism goals.

AB  - The motivation of the study is to assess the role of education, technological innovation, financial innovation, and clean energy consumption trade openness on environmental sustainability in Vietnam. The study implemented symmetric and asymmetric frameworks to document explanatory variables' coefficients on ES. Study findings suggest that education, innovation, and clean energy prompt environmental sustainability by lowering the carbon emission and ecological imbalance in the long and short run. Regarding the asymmetric assessment, the standard Wald test confirmed the asymmetric association in the long run and short run. For directional causality, the study implemented the TY-Fourier causality test. It revealed bidirectional causality between technological innovation and environmental sustainability. In contrast, unidirectional causality ran from education to ES and FDI to ES. Policy recommendations have been derived from the empirical findings of both symmetric and asymmetric investigations. These recommendations highlight the importance of prioritizing investments in education and technological innovation to enhance environmental sustainability. Moreover, promoting clean energy technologies and encouraging financial innovations can serve as additional catalysts for advancing sustainable practices. The implications of the policy as mentioned above offers valuable insights for policymakers and stakeholders in their endeavor to develop strategies to achieve environmental sustainability in Vietnam. While the findings contribute to our understanding of the determinants of ES in Vietnam, it is important to note that the study's scope is limited to the examined determinants. Other factors not included in the study may also have a significant role.

AB  - Collaborative consumption proposes fruitful avenues to achieve profitability and ensure environmental sustainability, becoming a paramount global concern. In the current study, the purpose is to investigate and pick up the constructs of mindful consumption, ego-involvement, and social norms and determine the primary motivations for Chinese consumers to act sustainably. To investigate the moderating role of platform trust and the mediating role of impulsive buying tendency among the relationships of mindful consumption, ego-involvement, and social norms regarding buying second-hand clothing consumption intentions. PLS-SEM statistical approach has been used to investigate the model relationships by incorporating a two-step approach through the SmartPLS3 statistical package. Online survey methodology was adopted to collect data from Chinese buyers of second-hand clothing of Xian Yu and Zhuan Zhuan online platforms. The study has proved the significant impact of mindful consumption, ego-involvement, and social norms on buying intentions of second-hand clothing. Furthermore, the study also supported the moderating role of platform trust and mediating role of impulsive buying tendency. Although the moderating and mediating impact remain insignificant on mindful consumption, as perceived. Theoretical and practical implications are given in accordance with the study.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to describe the student learning outcomes (SLOs) for a sustainability major, evaluate faculty incorporation of the SLOs into the courses in the sustainability major curriculum and measure student performance on the SLOs from entry into the major to the senior capstone course.
   Design/methodology/approach Through an iterative approach with a faculty advisory committee, SLOs were developed for the sustainability major. Curriculum mapping followed by evaluation of course syllabi were used to determine the extent to which each course addressed the SLOs. Student performance on most SLOs was measured through student assessment in an introductory and capstone course to evaluate the change in performance over time.
   Findings The core courses of the sustainability major were more likely to address the SLOs of the major than that of the elective courses. Where measured, student performance on the SLOs increased from the introductory course to the capstone course. Sustainability majors participated in an average of almost ten experiential learning opportunities focused on sustainability.
   Originality/value This research provides a longitudinal assessment of student learning in an undergraduate sustainability major. Because undergraduate sustainability degrees are generally new, this research can serve as a base upon which to continue to improve sustainability curriculum design.

AB  - The transformation for sustainability requires a paradigm shift towards systems thinking and interdisciplinary collaboration, which entails, above all, a process of cultural change affecting individual mindsets, organizations and society as a whole. Sustainability in higher education institutions (HEIs) has been a recurrent research field in the past decades. However, little attention has been paid to the processes of internal and cultural change and, in particular, to the first steps to prepare academic communities for change. Understanding "readiness for change" as a core organizational competency to overcome continuous environmental changes and considering the diluted hierarchy at HEIs, this article proposes the adoption of dialogical and developmental approaches in a single action case, the SDGs Seminars at the Universidad Politecnica de Madrid. This methodology was used to diagnose organizational and individual readiness for change considering cognitive, affective and behavioural components, and to identify consequences in organizational structures and culture. Our findings reveal that reframing dialogical spaces in HEIs to experience a collaborative and sustainability culture can unlock change, breaking down organizational silos, reducing resistances and engaging academic communities in the cocreation of institutional strategies. Furthermore, the case suggests that acting at the group level has impacts both on the individual and institutional levels.

AB  - This paper examines the influence of sustainability as a dimension of country image on behavioral intentions (so-called conations) of stakeholders toward Brazil. In addition, sustainable consumption, a moderating variable of the country-of-origin effect (not been identified in other studies), and consumers' gender and familiarity with the country are investigated as moderating variables. The empirical research is of a descriptive nature, and in terms of data collection, a survey method has been used on a sample of undergraduate students from foreign institutions. In total, 427 questionnaires have been considered in the analysis. The results of a multiple regression analyses show that the dimensions of country image (affective, political, technical and sustainability) are reliable factors that have a positive influence on conations toward Brazil, with the affective dimension exerting the strongest influence. Further comparisons show that the sustainability dimension is more important in shaping the conations of female respondents and those with low familiarity with Brazil, whereas the political dimension is more relevant in shaping the conations of male respondents and those with high familiarity with Brazil. Finally, the sustainability dimension has a minor influence on individuals with higher levels of sustainable consumption. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this study is to explore the learning outcomes of the project-based learning in a Master Class programme on sustainability carried out in collaboration by the University of Helsinki and a private company operating in global mining technology. The following two questions were addressed: Q1. What kind of sustainability competences do participants acquire in the Master Class? Q2. What is the role of PBL in the learning outcomes? Design/methodology/approach The study is based on an ex ante open-ended survey and post-ante interviews addressed to the participants. The data were analysed using the qualitative content analysis. Findings The findings show that the Master Class contributed to most of the competences under study. However, unlike in previous studies, systemic thinking is highlighted as a fundamental rather than a parallel core competence. Furthermore, the results also emphasise the role of emotions, which is insufficiently acknowledged and accounted for in sustainability education. Research limitations/implications - The study focussed only on the learning outcomes of the participants (students) and not the other parties (such as company and researchers). Practical implications - Future research should focus on affective dimension as a stepping stone to the transformational learning. In addition, the role of the systemic understanding in sustainability education should be highlighted as a core competence. Social implications - The study revealed the overall positive impacts of the co-creation in university business collaboration to the participants' sustainability competences. Originality/value The study presents an empirical case study where the various competence frameworks were applied with a result of confirming the validity of the existing key competences, in particular the systemic understanding and showing the role of the affective dimension in the transactional learning.

AB  - The study objectives are twofold: (i) combining the life cycle sustainability assessment (LCSA) framework and the multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) methodology for sustainability assessment and (ii) determining the most sustainable scenario for bioethanol production in China according to the preferences of the decision-makers/stakeholders.
   Life cycle assessment (LCA), life cycle costing (LCC), and social life cycle assessment (SLCA) are combined to collect the corresponding criteria data on environmental, economic, and social aspects, respectively. The study develops a novel SLCA method for quantifying the social criteria. The decision-makers/stakeholders can use linguistic terms to assess these criteria, and fuzzy theory is used to transform the linguistic variables into real numbers. Once the sustainability assessment criteria are determined, the study develops an MCDM method that combines the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and the VIKOR method to prioritize the alternatives. The AHP is used to determine the criteria weights that are a prerequisite when using VIKOR; the VIKOR method is then used to determine the sustainability sequence of the scenarios.
   The study's proposed method investigates an illustrative case about three alternative bioethanol production scenarios (wheat-based, corn-based, and cassava-based): The prior sequence (based on the sustainability performances) in descending order is cassava-based, corn-based, and wheat-based. The proposed methodology results allow Chinese decision-makers/stakeholders to select the most sustainable scenario among many alternatives. The proposed methodology is generic, meaning that further alternatives can be studied and the most sustainable option can be ultimately determined.
   The main study contribution is to test the combination of an MCDM methodology and LCSA for sustainability decision-making by studying three alternative pathways for bioethanol production in China. The proposed method feasibly enables the decision-makers/stakeholders to find the most sustainable scenario to achieve their objectives among various alternatives.

AB  - The Chilean government has introduced a policy that gives formal property rights over defined areas of seabed to organized groups of artisanal fishers with the goal of achieving sustainable exploitation of natural resources. We assessed differences in the attitudes of participating artisanal fishers toward this form of management to understand their importance in the design and implementation of fisheries management. We used questionnaires and participatory rural appraisal techniques to survey members of six fishing management committees. Fishers' attitudes varied significantly among syndicates in three main domains: attitudes toward the environment, unresolved aspects behind the management area policy and perceived benefits derived from adoption of the policy. These differences indicated the existence of distinct world views that structure fishers' behavior toward the marine environment and its management. In addition, the responses made by fishers correlated best with the degree of off-sector pluriactivity and their dependence on diving as a source of income. This suggested that a livelihood approach to the development of Chilean artisanal fisheries that considers the multiple economic niches of the fishers will be most effective in the implementation of dual conservation/management measures.

AB  - Threats of climate change and future energy price uncertainty have led to a global debate on energy efficiency, particularly the energy efficiency of housing projects. This serious global problem calls for improvement in energy efficiency from all sectors, especially the building sector which is considered a major energy consumer. Adoption of energy efficiency design practices in the housing sector has been perceived to have a significant potential to contribute greatly to the sustainable building process. Additionally, most studies indicate that the understanding and integration of stakeholder requirements has an enormous potential towards increasing the sustainability perspectives that relate to social, environmental, economic and technical issues of buildings. However, there is enough evidence from several studies suggesting a lack of common perspective on stakeholder requirements towards building energy efficiency (BEE) in housing development. Hence it is argued that stakeholders' alignment for energy efficiency improvement is crucial and a fundamental challenge that needs to be addressed if the goal of energy use reduction in buildings is to be achieved. The aim of this paper is to identify the important building energy requirements among stakeholders of mass housing projects and their impact on technical characteristics of mass housing projects. Through a survey of building industry stakeholders and using the House of Quality model for analysis of the data obtained, the study identified five (5) most rated BEE stakeholders' requirements in respect of housing development. The study gives a new insight into the considerations of building stakeholders regarding energy efficiency. This insight is useful towards achieving sustainable building solutions that meet the sustainability features of housing development in Ghana and other countries with similar energy and housing challenges.

AB  - Investor behavior is worth investigating as industries and institutions are concerned about spelling out environmental and social sustainability issues. The stream of research in environmental and social sustainabilities is from the points of view of institutions and policy. Nonetheless, environmental and social sustainability issues are based on individual levels, especially investors and their value. This study investigates whether moral attentiveness plays a role in financing orientation and investment propensity relationships. This research used an experimental method with a between-subject 2 x 2 factorial design. The financing orientation variable was manipulated into two, i.e., green financing orientation with a marginal interest rate and red financing orientation with a high interest rate. The moral attentiveness variable was classified into two, i.e., high and low levels. The results showed that investors in the emerging country showed a propensity to invest more in a red financing orientation condition with a high interest rate compared to that in a green financing orientation with a marginal interest rate. It was on pace with the interdisciplinary perspective of the hierarchy of needs that in emerging countries, one of the forceful elements underlying investment decisions was the monetary element to cater to primary (physiological) conditions. Meanwhile, from a utilitarian perspective, green financing with a marginal interest rate was more ethical than red financing with a high interest rate. It was because green financing gave more benefits to the environment and society. Moral attentiveness could filter the adverse impacts of financing orientation on investment propensity. This research will help policymakers and stakeholders drive investors' awareness about the industry's benefits to sustainability and promote the green revolution to a competitive market structure.

AB  - The global environment is experiencing increasingly rapid pollution due to the presence of harmful products generated by human activities, the emissions from vehicular traffic, and the release of carbon dioxide from industrial sources. To save this beautiful earth as well as human beings, it is necessary to reduce pollution by producing eco-friendly products and reducing reckless carbon emissions from industry. Furthermore, advertising serves as a very efficacious strategy for promoting sustainable green products and encouraging customer engagement. In response to the current circumstances, a supply chain model including a manufacturer, a retailer, and customers is devised, incorporating investments in green practices and advertising. This study examines the relationship between client demand and three key factors: marketing effort, the product's green level, and the selling price. In addition, a sharing contract policy between the manufacturer and the retailer on green investment costs is applied in this model. The main focus of this study is to find the optimal values of advertisement effort, the product's green level, the manufacturer's wholesale price, the retailer's selling price and the sharing percentage of green investment that maximize the profits of the retailer and manufacturer, as well as the integrated supply chain system of the proposed model. In order to demonstrate the practical significance of the concept, a numerical example is solved and then a comparative analysis is conducted. Moreover, sensitivity studies are performed to assess the impact of different model parameters on decision factors and profitability. In conclusion, this study provides management insights and offers some closing observations, along with suggestions for future research directions. The findings indicate that the implementation of a sharing contract policy yields more earnings to the participants in the supply chain compared to a decentralized situation. The centralized strategy in supply chain management (SCM) results in higher joint earnings for the manufacturer and the retailer compared to the decentralized and sharing contract policies.

AB  - Urban consumption patterns and lifestyles are increasingly important for the sustainability of cities today and in the future. However, considerations of consumption issues, social norms, behaviour and lifestyles within current urban sustainability research and practices are limited. Much untapped potential for the reduction of the environmental footprint of cities exists in combined production and consumption-based approaches, particularly in the "demand" areas of mobility, housing, food, and waste. To change unsustainable consumption and production patterns in cities, research needs to be transdisciplinary, actively involving stakeholders through co-creation processes. This paper builds on the premise that the perspectives and approaches of Sustainable Consumption and Production (SCP) for cities require the involvement of non-traditional stakeholders that are generally not included in urban planning processes such as social change initiatives, citizen groups and informal sector representatives. We present a transdisciplinary research and engagement framework to understand and advance the transition to sustainable SCP patterns and lifestyles in cities. This transdisciplinary approach to SCP transformations in cities combines co-creation, participatory visioning processes and back-casting methods, participatory urban governance and institutional change, and higher-order learning from small-scale community initiatives. We illustrate our conceptual framework through three empirical case studies in cities which take an integrative approach to lowering ecological footprints and carbon emissions.

AB  - Rapidly increasing knowledge on environmental problems and their potential solutions is underused by policy and practice. This mismatch constitutes a knowledge-action gap. To bridge the gap, the concept of actionable knowledge has been proposed, which is often understood as outputs, data, policy briefs, or other types of products. We instead propose to understand actionable knowledge as a process that has (1) cumulative and stepwise, (2) iterative and cyclical, and (3) coevolutionary characteristics. These characteristics are often considered in isolation or even to be in contradiction with each other. We integrate these three characteristics in an analysis of transdisciplinary project developing a catchment-scale land use roadmap and catchment coordination in the Kiiminkijoki river catchment, northern Finland. Our analysis is based on four general phases in a knowledge co-production process (making sense together, knowledge validation, usable outputs, boundary spanning), which are concretized through nine practical steps. We find that collection, analysis, and usage of the knowledge has been even more important for action than the final output (i.e., the roadmap). Furthermore, the process of actionable knowledge does not end with the project but continues with negotiations to establish a catchment coordinator position. Our major finding is that there is no single point in time during a transdisciplinary project to bridge the knowledge-action gap but multiple planned and surprising opportunities emerge during the process. Overall, our approach contributes to advance sustainability transformations in catchment management and governance by understanding how transdisciplinary projects can initiate and are a part of evolving knowledge-action processes.

AB  - This paper shares analytical insights on the position, challenges and potential for promoting Open Educational Resources (OER) in African Open Distance and eLearning (ODeL) institutions. The researchers sought to use a participatory research approach as described by Krishnaswamy (2004), in convening a sequence of two workshops at the Open University of Tanzania (OUT) as a strategy for collecting data to obtain the aforementioned insight. The principal workshop objectives were to analyse the existing status of OER at the OUT and subsequently to share lessons learned in OER creation and production, integration and use, and hosting and dissemination. Other objectives were to discuss the rationale for an institutional OER policy and identify a suitable work-flow process for developing OER at the OUT. The workshop participants were purposively selected for their experience in co-developing OER materials with various outside organisations. The study included 28 representatives of the OUT academic units, and one facilitator from OER Africa. Research techniques used to collect data included a questionnaire, focused group discussions, presentations, and panel discussions. Results indicated that OUT staff were willing to engage with OER but had limited awareness, skills and competencies in the creation, integration and use of OER. The outcome of the study was the development of nine draft OER resolutions expressing needs that include the development of a comprehensive institutional OER policy related to existing institutional policies in order to guide, support and promote research and sustainable OER practice via holistic participation. Enabling strategies included capacity building, increased internal and external collaboration, and enhanced access to and visibility of OER via the institutional repository.

AB  - Even though many small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) realize the importance of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for their sustainable business development, they face difficulties when individually pursuing this target. This paper aims to provide cluster-based SMEs with a framework to facilitate the uptake of the SDGs through a cluster network model. By focusing on the case study of a furniture production Cluster Management Organization (CMO Habic a network-based approach to sustainability management is analyzed in order to integrate the SDGs framework into SMEs' everyday language and day-to-day operations. Through a cluster model approach, industry-specific sustainability material issues are tackled jointly and with the aim of applying a common solution to a similar challenge, Lehi-ODS, an online sustainability management tool for SME self-evaluation, has been developed wherein the participating SMEs can gain an overarching knowledge about the UN 2030 Agenda, assess their own alignment with the SDGs and with respect to that of their peers, and prioritize initiatives to correctly deliver them. The main conclusion derived from the paper is that a CMO is deemed to be a valuable driver in identifying common sector-specific challenges of corporate sustainability and in addressing collectively the question of contributing to the SDGs.

AB  - The objective of making an organization 'sustainable' needs development on the economic, environmental, and social fronts. Indian Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises are facing the competition posed by rising technological advances in the market. Thus, Industry 4.0 intervention shall be highly useful in this context. This study assesses the barriers involved in implementing Industry 4.0 for sustainable production, and it attempts to find causality among the barriers using the 'Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory' method. The study considers eight barriers to implement Industry 4.0 for sustainable production. These barriers are inter-related and have causal relationships among them. This causality is represented graphically. The applied method delineates barriers under consideration for causality into two groups, namely; 'influencer' and 'influenced.' It also illustrates the strength of the influence of one barrier over the other through numerical values. The prime contribution of this study is to not only find the influencing barriers but also to mitigate them by allocating scarce organizational resources. Mitigating the influencing barriers would help in managing the influenced challenges. 'Technological upgradation', 'lack of policy frameworks' are the top two barriers that find its place in the hierarchy of importance established by this study. These barriers are also classified into the 'cause' group. Also, this study establishes that 'difficulty in access to credit' and 'non-readiness of the workforce' in adopting Industry 4.0 are 'influenced' barriers. This study shall be of importance to the small business practitioners and government analysts in evaluating barriers in implementing sustainable production initiatives using Industry 4.0. With this, Indian Micro, Small & Medium Enterprise needs to upgrade by upskilling young working population for the forthcoming technological revolution of Industry 4.0. Finally, we suggest several important implications for managers and policymakers. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction Onion is a significant vegetable crop in Ethiopia, serving as a source of income for smallholder farmers. However, various challenges in the production and post-harvest handling processes impede a consistent supply and marketing of the crop. This study focused on a comprehensive analysis of the onion supply chain, ranging from production to post-harvest handling, to address the existing production and marketing processes. The research initiative was undertaken to map the onion supply chain from farmers to consumers, intending to establish an improved marketing system in northwest Ethiopia.Methods The study area covered three onion-producing districts of the Amhara Region. Data collection involved interviews, observations, and market assessments using a structured questionnaire. Sampling followed a multistage technique. The analysis included descriptive statistics and food system analysis to map the supply chain and estimate marketing margins.Results and Discussion Post-harvest loss in onion production presents a major obstacle in the farming sector, impacting its growth. The study identified six alternative channels for onion marketing where different actors are involved throughout the supply chain. Key stakeholders include farmers, local collectors, brokers, transporters, wholesalers, retailers, and consumers. Packaging and sorting activities are implemented at different supply chain stages to minimize post-harvest losses. Farm-level activities, including curing, sorting, grading, and ventilating, are crucial for reducing losses. The perishable nature of onion bulbs and the existing production and handling challenges exacerbate post-harvest losses. Efforts to address this challenge demand a comprehensive approach, integrating interventions across the value chain, from improved cultivars and storage infrastructure to enhanced market access strategies. Hence, stakeholders and governmental organizations are urged to promote onion value-addition technologies, including the establishment of processing industries. Such endeavors promote collaborative efforts across the onion supply chain, ensuring sustainable benefits for producers and traders.

AB  - Discussions about the opening of science to society have led to the emergence of new fields such as sustainability science and transformative science. At the same time, the megatrend of stakeholder participation reached the academic world and thus scientific research processes. This challenges the way science is conducted and the tools, methods and theories perceived appropriate. Although researchers involve stakeholders, the scientific community still lacks comprehensive theoretical analysis of the practical processes behind their integration - for example what kind of perceptions scientists have about their roles, their objectives, the knowledge to gather, their understanding of science or the science-policy interface. Our paper addresses this research gap by developing four ideal types of stakeholder involvement in science - the technocratic, the functionalist, the neoliberal-rational and the democratic type. In applying the typology, which is based on literature review, interviews and practical experiences, we identify and discuss three major criticisms raised towards stakeholder involvement in science: the legitimacy of stakeholder claims, the question whether bargaining or deliberation are part of the stakeholder involvement process and the question of the autonomy of science. Thus, the typology helps scientists to better understand the major critical questions that stakeholder involvement raises and enables them to position themselves when conducting their research.

AB  - Industrial waste generation is proportional to the demand and the consumption of goods and services because industries need to increase the raw material to satisfy this demand, increasing their waste. The production process generates waste as undesirable output; sometimes, this waste is very significant, as in the case of the food service providers industry. In this context, this work aims to propose a methodological framework to transform this waste into co-products and generate business opportunities considering the sustainable development goals proposed in the UN 2030 agenda. The methodology merges reverse logistics and system dynamics principles to propose a seven-stage procedure: (i) distribution process analysis, (ii) description of variables and parameters, (iii) causal loop diagram construction, (iv) Forrester diagram creation, (v) simulation, (vi) scenario construction through sensitivity analysis and (vii) GUI. Graphical User Interface development. The case study addressed is a food service provider company located in Sonora, Mexico. The results show that the waste can be used as raw material and generate business opportunities with a considerable profit margin, e.g., if waste reuse rate is 35%, it means that these wastes can be used in manufacture of biofuel (11 k/month-$35 k), compost (7.5 ton/month-$13.1 k) and soap (1.96 k/month-$69.6 k). Systems dynamics can provide technological solutions for the application of reverse logistics within an organization, considering environmental policies (waste management).

AB  - Many higher education institutions have assumed the role of diffusing knowledge, values, attitudes and behaviours that favour sustainability. A key objective in such work is training university teachers to apply sustainability criteria to their respective disciplines. While university teachers' active participation is essential to achieving this goal, their ideas about and predispositions towards introducing sustainability into curricula are not always understood or appreciated. In this paper, we report on a questionnaire survey at the University of Valencia, Spain, on the current baseline situation for introducing sustainability across the university's curricula. We also report on a measure to periodically review the situation, including progress of and/or decline in introducing sustainability into diverse subject areas, focusing on a series of indicators grouped under the common name ' Indicator'. Key findings from the survey include the widespread support for introducing sustainability across the university's curricula; however, as might be expected, significant differences occur in how questions are addressed by staff from various disciplines, including how they relate to departmental perceptions, interpretations and performance of sustainability-related teaching.

AB  - Today, just like in every field, the importance of sustainability is also increasing in urban logistics. In this sense, the urban logistics performance of a city should also be based on economic, social and environmental factors, which are the basic components of sustainability. In this sense, the determination of urban logistics performance criteria is an important basis for an economic, social and environmental coordinated development. In this study, a Sustainable Urban Logistics Performance Index (SULPI) is developed. In the study, the criteria required for SULPI were determined and classified in accordance with the sustainability components. Subsequently, these criteria were evaluated by 4 different experts representing different stakeholders of urban logistics using the AHS Method and the weight of each SULPI criterion was calculated. The proposed model contributes to the literature by using an approach with the criteria representing sustainability. It is also based on real and easily accessible data for the relevant city for which the SULPI is calculated. SULPI will help the authorities to compare the logistics performance of the cities according to the determined criteria, make and/or revise plans to improve the urban logistics practices in terms of sustainability.

AB  - This research investigates Bainem Forest in Algiers, Algeria, as a critical urban asset for public health and well-being, focusing on its potential for "forest therapy." Employing a mixed-methods approach integrating Space Syntax analysis with field observations, the study evaluates the forest's spatial accessibility, connectivity, and the equitable distribution of amenities. Findings highlight significant spatial disparities, with poor connectivity in the southern and western regions and a concentration of amenities- such as benches, picnic areas, and restrooms- near primary entrances. These inequalities hinderexploration and limit access, particularly for marginalized groups. The trail network further reflects uneven accessibility, with some areas facilitating easy movement and others remaining poorly connected. Inspired by successful urban forest models in Curitiba (Brazil), Portland (USA), and Singapore, this study proposes a comprehensive management strategy for Bainem Forest. Recommendations include improving connectivity through expanded and well-integrated trail systems, ensuring equitable distribution of amenities, enhancing waste management practices, and fostering community participation in forest stewardship. These measures aim to transform Bainem Forest into a sustainable, inclusive urban space, serving as a model for integrating ecological health, urban design, and social equity in Algiers.

AB  - Trust is an essential element in the sharing economy. However, most existing sharing economy trust research has largely focused on buyers' trust perspective, overlooking the perceived trustworthiness of sellers as an important factor in the mutual selection process. Drawing on trust in the sharing economy theory, this study advances the consumer-to-consumer (C2C) trust framework by considering trust in peers from both the buyer and seller perspectives, and introducing trust in the product within the online second-hand trading context. It also extends the third party recognition target from the platform to the buyer, seller, and product, examining the scenario in which second-hand trading platforms apply third party recognition to display trust information. The partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) approach is employed in this study to analyze the data collected from Mercari users in Japan. We conclude that third party recognition positively influences trust in the buyer, seller, platform, and product. Platform trust produces a positive effect on sellers' intention to supply. The results imply that second-hand buyers are primarily focused on the commodity being traded, and their purchase intention is not significantly affected by trust in the seller or trust in the platform. Furthermore, the findings reveal the establishment of a virtuous cycle - third party recognition improves trust in the platform and products, which in turn promotes increased consuming and supplying activities. In conclusion, this study contributes to the understanding of trust dynamics on second-hand platforms, with important implications for platform design and user engagement strategies to support the achievement of platform long-term sustainability.

AB  - Mining activity in developing countries is frequently associated with the most severe and disastrous environmental impacts, posing a threat to the survival and livelihoods of local communities where agriculture is the primary sustenance. Therefore, this article explores the effects of mining operations on the farmers' livelihood assets, corporate social responsibility, and mining acceptance in the mining communities. Kenema district in Sierra Leone was purposively selected because of predominant rice farming amidst active mining activities. Questionnaires were provided to a random sample of 358 farmers in the district. To extract meaningful information from the questionnaire data, a Partial Least Square Structural Equation Model (PLS-SEM) using SmartPLS4 software was employed as it focuses on testing a theoretical framework from a predictive perspective. This facilitated the development of a higher component model with a reflective-reflective structure to estimate the sustainable livelihoods model. The findings show that mining operations have a negative impact on farmers' sustainable livelihood assets, except for positive financial assets. Likewise, mineral exploitation had adverse and significant effects on mining acceptance and corporate social responsibility for the communities. Corporate social responsibilities can significantly mediate the relationship between mining industries and mining acceptance in the mining areas. The paper highlights the importance of balancing environmental sustainability with socioeconomic development in mining policy. To achieve this, stakeholders and the government should enforce strict regulations on the reclamation and restoration of mined fields and ensure mining industries adhere to their corporate social responsibilities in the areas they operate.

AB  - Scientific conferences foster career development and collaborations while nurturing scientific communities that are especially critical to transdisciplinary research and mentorship. Recent transitions to virtual conference formats mitigate financial and logistical barriers to attending but the social and intellectual implications are less well understood. In this mixed-methods study, we examine participation by gender and country income level in the second virtual year of a well-established agriculture, nutrition, and health conference in 2021. These data are interlinked with qualitative insights into the challenges and benefits of virtual participation. We find that virtual conferences facilitate access for women and participants in low- and middle-income countries by removing visa requirements and travel costs and enabling attendance alongside care obligations. Virtual interactions can disrupt power dynamics and increase the efficiency of knowledge exchange, but the loss of rich in-person human connections, compounded by inequitable internet access is not conducive to nurturing scientific communities. We need an intentional shift in how and why we organise and participate in conferences in order to maximise the benefits to inclusion, equity, and sustainability; and minimize trade-offs to intellectual and social connections online.

AB  - The social-ecological system framework (SESF) can be useful for applied research and management practice beyond its traditional academic applications. In this article we transform the SESF into an image-based practical tool to facilitate knowledge exchange and deliberation processes within community-based natural resource comanagement settings. We develop a transdisciplinary methodology to transform the SESF into simple and context relevant images that are understandable by nonspecialists, yet the image-based framework still conveys its core tenets of systems thinking, a checklist for system complexity and conceptualizing social-ecological interactions. We then demonstrate a mixed-method approach for testing the usefulness of the image-based framework for enhancing communication, knowledge exchange, and deliberation processes. We show how the academic uses of the SESF, its core tenets, can serve the same purpose for nonacademic actors. When transformed, the image-based SESF has potential to be a tool that can enhance communication and knowledge exchange between actors in governance settings. We demonstrate our methodology with small-scale fishers involved with comanagement in the Gulf of Nicoya, Costa Rica. In the example, we show how scientists must learn from fishers, to understand how they view their system, in order to make the image-based tool useful in context. We then test its usefulness by exploring the hypothesis that the image-based framework can help fishers discuss with more depth and complexity because it provides a simple conceptual base for systems thinking and a core set of variables to consider as interacting. Furthermore, we explore how using the framework during deliberation may be able to alter the social-psychological outcomes of participants using field experimental methods. We discuss our combined methodology, for transforming the framework and measuring deliberation impacts, while reflecting on new ways of thinking about how the SESF can be useful for applied research and practice.

AB  - CONTEXT: The transition to sustainable fruit production is vital for global sustainability and agricultural development. However, implementing these insights into practice faces significant challenges. OBJECTIVES: Pomelo (Citrus maxima), a prominent citrus species in tropical and subtropical regions, has been cultivated to enhance farmer profitability but increasing yields often comes at the cost of environmental degradation. This study uses pomelo as a case study to assess key factors influencing pomelo production and establish optimal practices that meet consumption-based food while co-benefits for environmental and economic sustainability. METHODS: A comprehensive study was conducted by combining 1155 farm surveys (from 2010, 2018, and 2022) with 31 field experiments. Life cycle assessment (LCA), classification and regression tree (CART) analysis, and scenario analysis were employed to develop pathways for sustainable pomelo production in Pinghe County, Fujian Province, China. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Results show no significant differences in pomelo yield across the three years; however, pomelo production in 2022 demonstrated a 60 %-67 % lower in environmental footprints and a 64 %-76 % higher benefit-cost ratio (BCR) compared to 2010 and 2018. Tree age was identified as a critical factor influencing pomelo yield, with optimal yields observed in trees older than 12.5 years. The rate of phosphorus fertilizer application was a key determinant of the phosphorus footprint (PF), which was positively correlated with phosphorus fertilizer rates. Similarly, nitrogen fertilizer application significantly impacted both carbon and nitrogen footprints (CF and NF) as well as the BCR. CF and NF increased with higher nitrogen fertilizer rates, while BCR exhibited a negative correlation with nitrogen fertilizer application. Implementing Science and Technology Backyards (STB) followed by farmer training of slightly more than pomelo nutrient requirements practice (SNRP) or coordinate management by farmers and researchers of matching pomelo nutrients requirement practice (MNRP) had 50 %-91 % lower environmental footprints per ton of pomelo produced and 15 %-44 % higher BCR compared to current farming practices (FP) via reducing 46 %-77 % N, 49 %-92 % P2O5, and 42 %-73 % K2O per hectare. Moreover, adopting 100 % MNRP in pomelo production, along with sustainable fertilizer practices and the implementation of innovative fertilizers, could reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (0.76 Tg), reactive nitrogen (Nr) emissions (8.76 Gg), phosphorus (P) losses (0.84 Gg), and augment net ecosystem economic benefits (NEEB) (0.94 billion CNY) at the county scale. SIGNIFICANCE: Our study provides evidence-based strategies for achieving sustainable pomelo production through multi-stakeholder collaboration of STB, government, enterprises, and smallholders.

AB  - Biomass-derived biochar has gained significant attention due to its unique properties and potential applications in various fields, including asphalt pavement engineering. However, there has been no comprehensive review to date that systematically examines the state-of-the-art research on biochar utilization in asphalt pavements, identifies the key knowledge gaps, and provides recommendations for future research directions. This review aims to fill this gap by providing a novel and critical analysis of the sources and production methods of biochar, the techniques for modifying and characterizing its properties, and its recent applications as an asphalt binder modifier, asphalt mixture additive, and stormwater filter material. The review employs a systematic literature search and analysis methodology, using scientific databases such as Web of Science and Scopus, and keywords related to biochar, asphalt, pavement, and environmental and economic aspects. The selected studies are reviewed and synthesized to identify research gaps, challenges, and future directions, with a focus on the technical, environmental, and economic feasibility of biochar utilization in asphalt pavements. The review also examines the life cycle assessment, carbon sequestration potential, and cost-benefit analysis of biochar utilization. The novelty of this review lies in its holistic approach to assessing state-of-the-art knowledge and its identification of key research needs and opportunities for advancing this emerging field. The review aims to provide valuable insights and recommendations for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers interested in leveraging the benefits of biochar for sustainable and high-performance asphalt pavements.

AB  - The social responsibility of corporate mining has been challenged by a significant socio-political risk from local communities. These issues reduce shareholder value by increasing costs and decreasing the market perception of corporate social responsibility. Community engagement is the process of understanding the behavior and interests of a group of targeted mining communities through surveys and data analysis, with the purpose of incorporating mining community acceptance into the mining sustainability. While mining organizations have discussed community engagement to varying degrees, there are three main shortcomings in current studies, as concluded in the authors' previous research. This paper presents a framework to apply discrete choice theory to improve mining community engagement and corporate mining social responsibility. In addition, this paper establishes the main technical challenges to implement the developed framework, and presents methods to overcome the challenges for future research with a case study. The contribution of this research will transform mine sustainability in a fundamental way by facilitating the incorporation of effective community engagement. This will lead to more sustainable mines that local communities support.

AB  - While the myriad benefits of palm oil as a food, makeup, and cleaning product additive drive its demand, globally, the palm oil industry remains largely unsustainable and unregulated. The negative externalities of palm oil production are diverse and devastating to tropical ecosystem integrity and human livelihoods in palm oil nations. Given the current trend in increasing sustainability and transparency in global supply chains, we suggest that sustainability policy reforms are feasible and have the potential to promote 21st century U.S. and international sustainability standards. Polycentric governance may improve the attainment of sustainable global palm oil standards with a set of rules that interact across linear and nonlinear hierarchies and structures, thereby improving collaboration efforts, and increasing connectivity and learning across scales and cultures. Transformations towards sustainability in international palm oil governance has the potential to make valuable contributions to global sustainable development and improve the prosperity of poor rural communities in the tropics by providing a framework for achieving palm oil trade transparency and aligning the sustainability goals across a range of actors.

AB  - The objective of the paper is to evaluate the quality of systemic change management (CHM) and readiness for change in five Central European countries. The secondary goal is to identify trends and upcoming changes in the field of digital innovations in healthcare. The results show that all compared countries (regardless of their historical context) deal with similar CHM challenges with a rather similar degree of success. A questionnaire distributed to hospitals clearly showed that there is still considerable room for improvement in terms of the use of specific CHM tools. A review focused on digital innovations based on the PRISMA statement showed that there are five main directions, namely, data collection and integration, telemedicine, artificial intelligence, electronic medical records, and M-Health. In the hospital environment, there are considerable reservations in applying change management principles, as well as the absence of a systemic approach. The main factors that must be monitored for a successful and sustainable CHM include a clearly defined and widely communicated vision, early engagement of all stakeholders, precisely set rules, adaptation to the local context and culture, provision of a technical base, and a step-by-step implementation with strong feedback.

AB  - Sustainability describes how a system remains diverse and productive; this is the potential for long-term maintenance of well-being having ecological, economic, political, and cultural dimensions. Education for sustainable development (ESD) emphasizes on including the key sustainable development issues into teaching and learning, that is, climate change, disaster risk reduction, biodiversity, poverty reduction, and sustainable consumption. This effort requires effective pedagogy to ensure a participatory teaching and learning method that will motivate and empower future leaders to ensure sustainability in their social systems. Malaysia has incorporated the principles of Agenda 21 as one of the important sustainable development documents into its national planning process. However, the effectiveness of these teaching-learning programs, and their effective pedagogical approaches and endpoints are not satisfactorily ensured. Therefore, at first, this article reviews the existing various programs and research activities of public and private higher educational institutions in Malaysia that address sustainability. It then discusses the pedagogical approaches of these programs and how they are related to the key concept of the ESD. Finally, some conclusions and recommendations have been suggested to improve the initiatives to develop a scientifically sound and effective pedagogy for the ESD programs in higher education systems in Malaysia.

AB  - Multi-criteria analysis and detailed impact analysis were carried out to assess the sustainability of four remedial alternatives for metal-contaminated soil/sediment at former timber treatment sites and harbour sediment with different scales. The sustainability was evaluated in the aspects of human health and safety, environment, stakeholder concern, and land use, under four different scenarios with varying weighting factors. The Monte Carlo simulation was performed to reveal the likelihood of accomplishing sustainable remediation with different treatment options at different sites. The results showed that in situ remedial technologies were more sustainable than ex-situ ones, where in-situ containment demonstrated both the most sustainable result and the highest probability to achieve sustainability amongst the four remedial alternatives in this study, reflecting the lesser extent of off-site and on-site impacts. Concerns associated with ex-situ options were adverse impacts tied to all four aspects and caused by excavation, extraction, and off-site disposal. The results of this study suggested the importance of considering the uncertainties resulting from the remedial options (i.e., stochastic analysis) in addition to the overall sustainability scores (i.e., deterministic analysis).

AB  - Biobanking has paved the way for significant biomedical advancements which could be very advantageous for a developing nation like the Philippines. Current challenges faced by the existing biobank in the country suggest the need for satellite biobanks. The main objective of this manuscript was to summarize various important factors to consider in the establishment of a regional biobank in a developing country. The paper also identified the various challenges to the sustainability of the biobank and highlighted potential solutions and opportunities that could address these concerns. Western Visayas, Philippines is a viable site for a regional biobank due to its location, health situation, availability of human resources, and existing research infrastructures. The main obstacles to the establishment of this biobank are the participation of the public, the involvement of physicians and academic scientists, operational issues, and stable financial support. The success and sustainability of the regional biobank depend on multisectoral collaboration. Western Visayas institutions must increase their research collaborations and must form public-private partnerships to advance science, and maximize the benefits of a regional biobank. In general, a successful regional biobank should consider a framework focused on financial, operational, and social dimensions. Public interest summary: Health research in developing countries may benefit from the establishment of human biobanks. Although biobanking studies in these developing nations have grown significantly over the last decade, challenges still exist that impede progress toward edifying it. Important factors like resources, acceptability, demand, implementation, and practicality should be considered in the establishment of a regional biobank in a developing country. Although implementation and practicality aspects appear to be viable, serious challenges encompassing human and capital resources, as well as social, legal, and ethical issues must be taken into consideration.

AB  - Livelihood encompasses the resources and capabilities that individuals and households utilize to ensure their survival and to enhance their well-being. This study examined the impact of the Bole Lemi Industry Park on livelihood systems in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. It focused on how the establishment of the industrial park affected the livelihoods of displaced communities. A survey was conducted on 379 household heads who were displaced by the industrial park, ensuring representation across various factors such as gender, marital status, education level, ethnic group, and religion. Descriptive statistics, including frequency counts, mean values, standard deviations, and percentages, were used to analyze the data. Multiple linear regression models were employed to investigate how socioeconomic variables predicted the household heads' annual income before and after the establishment of the park. The findings revealed that 84% of the household heads said that the BLIP has hurt their livelihoods. The majority of respondents (69%) became jobless as a result of the BLIP. Another 16% transitioned to urban lifestyles, while 7.3% shifted to semi-agrarian and 5.6% to trade and services. This study identified the balance gap between industrial development and the interests of local farming communities, and how it failed to ensure sustainable livelihoods. It is recommended that development projects in Addis Ababa prioritize the affected communities by offering compensation, support for resettlement, and opportunities for livelihood diversification. Taking a comprehensive and participatory approach to industrial park development is crucial for achieving sustainable and equitable economic growth while safeguarding the well-being of local communities.

AB  - Purpose - This study aims at understanding how higher education institutions (HEIs) can contribute to sustainable development, by designing their programmes for bringing about a transformative impact on communities and students, and also to examine what alternative pedagogical approaches could be used for that. In the past decades, HEIs have increasingly created social innovation (SI) programmes, as a way to achieve United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. These community-oriented and field-based programmes are difficult to ally with conventional classroom education. This study explores how these programmes could integrate the participatory approach and what would be the benefits. It also investigates the effectiveness of the experiential learning approach for teaching sustainability. Design/methodology/approach A case study method is used to document SI projects initiated by an HEI programme in rural India. Findings - It was found that the participatory approach contributes to empowering communities and also benefits the students in terms of academic, professional and personal growth. Empirical findings show that experiential learning is an efficient method to teach sustainability. Ultimately, both pedagogical approaches are found to be mutually beneficial. Originality/value - This study fills a gap in the literature, by providing empirical evidence on how HEI can implement innovative educational strategies such as participatory approach and experiential learning in their programmes towards teaching sustainability. A conceptual model for HEI interested in developing similar programmes is also proposed. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this study is one of the first studies focusing on the context of Indian HEI.

KW  - MANAGEMENT
AB  - A total of 17 fishery systems covering gillnets, traps and seines targeting fish and crustaceans as well as hand-collected mussels in the state of Pernambuco (Brazil) were compared and analyzed in the present study using the RAPFISH method and 57 attributes to qualify five evaluation dimensions: economic, social, ecological, technological and management. The aim was to determine the sustainability of each field from the fishery (i.e. stocks) and social standpoint (i.e. fishermen). With regard to sustainability, it was generally apparent that the fisheries analyzed are far from any ideal that would permit long-term exploitation, but are nonetheless also distant from the extremes of non-sustainability in the environments investigated. The low degree of organization demonstrated in most fisheries of Pernambuco and the low level of schooling among the fishermen contribute toward maintaining the status quo, with an increase in situations of conflict and a lack of valorization regarding the activities. The shrimp system is the least sustainable, mainly due to its environmental impact; however, this is compensated by the relatively higher quality of living provided stakeholders through its exploitation. The evaluation dimensions showed the most sustainable system in Pernambuco to be the stationary 'uncovered pound net', followed by the line system. Alternative procedures for integrated fishery management, such as an increase in statistical data, coastal zoning to limit shrimp farms and establishing protected areas are proposed and discussed. Such procedures may contribute toward the formulation of public policies for the fishery industry of the state, which is essentially made up of artisanal fisheries with low yields and exercised by the 11 926 fishermen affiliated with coastal fishing colonies.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) symbolizes numerous devices which are connected globally through the internet technology and are able to collect and share relevant data. The IoT has thus achieved a significant advancement in the field of sensors, networks, and communication technologies, such as long-term evolution (LTE) technology, fifth generation (5G) technology, wireless sensor networks (WSN), and others. Apart from technological advancements, the ability of IoT to run fully embedded (with or without an operating system), gather real-time data, estimate physical parameters, facilitate decision making based on the data gathered, use of various networks (e.g., local area networks (LAN), low-power wide-area network (LPWAN), cellular LPWAN) has provided enormous opportunities for its applications in the railway industry and other domains. The current study performs a comprehensive holistic survey of various IoT technologies that can be used in railway operations, management, maintenance, video surveillance, and safety at level crossings. This study also discusses current trends in the IoT, emerging IoT technologies, green IoT applications, and various research studies that have been conducted in the areas related to railway applications. Furthermore, various challenges that are associated with the IoT applications are discussed along with potential efforts that can be made to overcome these challenges. The outcomes of this work are expected to offer important insights regarding the applicability of IoT technologies for sustainable railway transportation, their future potential, operational benefits to relevant stakeholders and authorities, as well as critical future research needs that have to be addressed in the following years.

AB  - Previous research has shown that female and Hispanic students who are underrepresented in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) face more educational barriers than their non-Hispanic, male peers. However, little research has been conducted on the effects of intersectional identities in the STEM space. In an effort to bridge the gap in underrepresented students' experience, the PSEG Institute for Sustainability Studies organizes a paid, interdisciplinary, team-based, experiential learning and internship program called the Green Teams that occurs during 10 weeks of the summer. The Green Teams Program strives to provide undergraduate students from all backgrounds-academically, economically, and demographically-an opportunity to develop their abilities in STEM fields and prepare them to enter the professional world. Based upon a survey given post-internship, self-reported learning gains for all students were analyzed to determine if the program had a significantly greater impact on students who are from groups traditionally underrepresented in STEM in their STEM-related learning gains and their confidence in STEM disciplines. Through t-tests, a Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and a 2-way factorial Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), Hispanic and female participants were found to report significantly higher learning gains than their counterparts in multiple STEM areas from increased tolerance for obstacles to gains in self confidence. The results of the study suggest Hispanic and female students benefit from paid work experiences in STEM with diverse peers and intentional, supportive mentoring. This research on the Green Teams Program provides insight into how this approach positively impacts STEM education of individuals from traditionally underrepresented groups in STEM. The findings may help to further guide the development of the Green Teams Program and the adoption of paid, interdisciplinary, team-based, experiential learning and internship experiences in additional academic STEM settings.

AB  - Introduction: In the Netherlands multiple single, cross sector and cross governance level policy reforms were introduced to improve health and social care and decrease fragmentation. In addition to legislative and funding measures, the governmental strategy was to set up long-lasting improvement programs and supported by applied research.
   Description: Five national improvement programs on chronic disease management, maternity care, youth care, care for older people and dementia care were analysed. The Laws of integration of Leutz were used as an analytical framework. The programs demonstrated a mixture of employing policy, quality and financial measures to stimulate coherence and integration.
   Discussion: The Laws that Leutz formulated are to a large extent applicable in the Dutch context. However, the characteristics of the system of governance being corporatist in its structure and its culture imply that it is hard to distinguish single actors being in the lead. Integration is a more complex process and requires more dynamics, than the law 'keep it simple, stupid' suggests.
   Conclusions: In the Dutch context integration implies a permanent pursuit of aligning mechanisms for integration. Sustainable integration requires long-standing efforts of all relevant stakeholders and cannot be achieved quickly. It may take a decade of consistently applying a mix of policy instruments.

AB  - Although considerable research has been conducted on improving sustainability performance, many important questions remain. Drawing on Social Learning Theory (SLT) and Stakeholder Theory (ST), our model suggests a mechanism, Environmental Organizational Citizenship Behavior (EOCB), through which Environmental Transformational Leadership (ETL) influences Organizational Sustainability Performance (SP). In addition, employees' Work Passion (WP) will moderate the relationship between ETL and EOCB. A total of 240 full-time employees in Saudi Arabia's petrochemical industries submitted responses via survey questionnaires, and the proposed hypotheses were tested using hierarchical regression analysis. Results were consistent with the hypothesized conceptual scheme in that ETL indirectly impacts SP through EOCB. In the meantime, the WP of employees plays a moderating role in the relationship between ETL and EOCB as well as in the indirect effect of ETL on SP via EOCB. As a way to improve their sustainability performance, organizations must hire and nominate ETLs who can influence their employees to become aware of environmental protection and instill these values. Furthermore, employees' passion for their work encourages them to engage in voluntary environmental behaviors. A discussion of the findings, implications, limitations, and future research avenues is included.

AB  - This article presents a research investigation focusing on the effects of ChatGPT utilization on sustainable education and development. The study employed five machine learning (XGBoost, RF, SVM, GBDT, and ANN) models for predicting the impacts of ChatGPT usage in education, aiming at identifying the potential benefits of ChatGPT usage on learners, tutors, and possible future implications using the data collected via social networking sites. A total of 2,936 datasets concerning the impacts of ChatGPT utilization on sustainable education were analyzed. Four of the research AI-predictive models predicted the impacts of ChatGPT usage on sustainable education and development with greater accuracy with R-2 values of >.96. However, the XGBoost and RF models outperformed the other models with R-2 values >.98. The results indicate that the XGBoost model achieved the highest accuracy with R-2 > .98, training time(s) 8.4157, and testing time 0.0618 respectively. Furthermore, findings of the study revealed that utilization of ChatGPT increases students' interest in learning, self-confidence, and ability to study independently. Also, the results of the study will provide valuable insights for education stakeholders in understanding the potential benefits, and future implications of ChatGPT usage on sustainable education, and provide direction for upcoming studies.

AB  - Nuclear sites around the world are being decommissioned and remedial actions are being undertaken to enable the sites or parts of the sites to be reused. Although this is relatively straightforward for most sites, experience has suggested that preventative action is needed to minimise the impact of remediation activities on the environment and the potential burden to future generations. Removing all contamination in order to make a site suitable for any use generates waste and has associated environmental, social and economic detriments and benefits that should be taken into account. Recent experience of OECD Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA) member countries in the remediation of contaminated land, predominantly contaminated soil and groundwater, on nuclear sites during decommissioning has been assessed by an NEA task group. The experience was used to identify strategic considerations for nuclear site remediation, to consider the application of sustainability principles to nuclear site remediation, to describe good practice, and to make recommendations for further research and development The key aspects that were identified were that 1) site remediation should be sustainable by resulting in an overall net benefit; and 2) an adaptive approach is essential in order to take into account the inherent uncertainty associated with the decommissioning and site remediation timescales. A report describing the findings was published by OECD/NEA in 2016. The conclusions provide insights to decision makers, regulators, implementers and stakeholders involved in nuclear site decommissioning so that they can achieve sustainable remediation of nuclear sites, now and in the future.

AB  - Purpose - Academic sustainability programs aim to develop key competencies in sustainability, including problem-solving skills and the ability to collaborate successfully with experts and stakeholders. These key competencies may be most fully developed in new teaching and learning situations. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the kind of, and extent to which, these key competencies can be acquired in real-world learning opportunities.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper summarizes key competencies in sustainability, identifies criteria for real-world learning opportunities in sustainability programs, and draws on dominant real-world learning models including project- and problem-based learning, service learning, and internships in communities, businesses, and governments. These components are integrated into a framework to design real-world learning opportunities.
   Findings - A "functional and progressive" model of real-world learning opportunities seems most conducive to introduce students (as well as faculty and community partners) to collaborative research between academic researchers and practitioners. The stepwise process combined with additional principles allows building competencies such as problem solving, linking knowledge to action, and collaborative work, while applying Concepts and methods from the field of sustainability.
   Practical implications - The paper offers examples of real-world learning opportunities at the School of Sustainability at Arizona State University, discusses general challenges of implementation and organizational learning, and draws attention to critical success factors such as collaborative design, coordination, and integration in general introductory courses for undergraduate students.
   Originality/value - The paper contributes to sustainability education by clarifying how real-world learning opportunities contribute to the acquisition of key competencies in sustainability. It proposes a functional and progressive model to be integrated into the (undergraduate) curriculum and suggests strategies for its implementation.

AB  - Multidisciplinary approaches to managing seascapes are increasingly being recognized as best practice and therefore prioritized by conservation agencies. For most coastal areas the strengthening of customary marine tenure, rules and regulations should yield even greater biodiversity and livelihood benefits. Here, we present the conservation planning results from a locally-managed marine area programme initiated by the Government of Aceh, Indonesia, which aimed to empower coastal communities to sustainably and equitably manage marine resources with local government. In 2008 the government established a Marine and Fisheries Task Force to identify priority areas for marine biodiversity (through systematic conservation planning) and coastal communities (through participatory planning). In addition to the existing 264,788 ha of marine management units, systematic planning identified another 53,372 ha. However, the subsequent stakeholder participation phase, involving intensive local consultations, further expanded the locally-managed marine area network by 6,725 ha and to a total of 23 locally-managed marine areas. This combined approach had additional benefits because it generated a strong sense of local ownership. For communities it initiated a process for recognizing their customary claimed areas and resolved overlapping boundaries between neighbouring communities, thereby reducing the likelihood of future conflicts over natural resource use. For government, it provided the basis of a robust governance system, with 34 new or revised decrees being completed and an additional USD 1.6 million being allocated for implementation of locally-managed marine areas. This participatory approach should considerably increase the successful delivery of a sustainable and equitable locally-managed marine area network for Aceh, which has wide application for the South-east Asian region and beyond.

AB  - Public participation is increasingly viewed as a means to initiate social learning among stakeholders, resource managers, and policy makers rather than to ensure democratic representation. This growing understanding of participatory activities as learning platforms can be seen as a direct response to shifts in how natural resources management is framed, namely as uncertain, non-linear, and interlinked with the human dimensions. Social learning as it is discussed within the natural resources management (NRM) context features a process of collective and communicative learning that is thought to enable stakeholders to arrive at a shared understanding of a specific environmental situation and to develop new solutions as well as ways of acting together in pursuit of a shared ambition. Yet, although case-study research on social-learning processes provides multiple accounts of positive experiences, there are also reports of mistaken learning, the intensification of tensions or conflict, and failure to reach agreement or verifiable consensus. Based on results of a postal survey of stakeholder experiences in two involvement initiatives, we can draw two main conclusions: First, social learning is a multidimensional and dynamic process and, as such, evolves in stages and to various degrees. Second, stakeholder processes are shaped and affected by a multitude of factors that constrain the occurrence of learning processes and eventually limit the extent to which these can contribute to sustainable NRM. Foremost, the fact that the intensity of stakeholder learning differed in the two investigated initiatives reinforces the role organizational arrangements play in encouraging the type of communicative process necessary for stakeholder learning.

AB  - Reintroductions and other conservation translocations are an important but often controversial form of wildlife management. Some authors have suggested the low success rates may reflect poor planning and decision-making. In this study, we used examples of herpetofaunal reintroductions, published in four volumes of the IUCN's Reintroduction Specialist Group Global Perspectives in Reintroduction Biology, to identify the objectives set by reintroduction practitioners, the indicators of success they choose and the types of difficulties they encounter. We found objectives focused on target species, but also on broader ecological objectives, such as ecosystem restoration, and social and economic aims. Practitioners reported high success rates: however, these referred to a mixture of general objectives, reflecting the fundamental aims of programmes, and technical aspects, such as developing husbandry protocols, that are important only as stepping stones for broader objectives. In some cases, important objectives were not assigned relevant indicators, thus making assessment impossible. Non-biological aspects such as funding dynamics were the most important source of difficulties; however, they were not always openly recognized by assigning relevant objectives and indicators. We argue that the adoption of a more structured approach to decision-making could help in addressing all these issues. In particular, we recommend that where possible, managers should clearly state all relevant objectives and constraints, and distinguish their respective relevance and importance. If such elements are not clearly defined a priori, planning and assessing reintroductions can become difficult or even impossible, increasing the risk of inefficient use of resources.

AB  - The Arctic is a remote region that has become increasingly globalized, yet it remains extremely vulnerable to many risks. The COVID-19 pandemic presented new challenges to the region. Using the search, appraisal, synthesis and analysis (SALSA) approach to conduct a meta-synthesis of the academic and grey literature on the impacts of the pandemic, an assessment is conducted of the types of risks that have been presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, the scales, and the national response strategies for mitigating the risks. Two case studies are explored: Iceland and Greenland, island nations that exemplify the extremes of the Arctic and reliance on tourism, a sector that was nearly entirely suspended by the pandemic. An evaluative matrix is employed which combines five different scales of risk-nano, micro, meso, macro and cosmic-with a sustainability categorization of impacts. The risks of the pandemic cut across the respective scale and categories, with the potential for macro-scale events (systemic risk) to unfold linked to economic spillover effects driven by the curtailment of tourism and various supply chain delays. Both Iceland and Greenland have exemplified risk mitigation strategies that prioritize health over wealth, very strictly in the case of the latter. Strict border controls and domestic restrictions have enabled Iceland and Greenland to have much lower case and death numbers than most nations. In addition, Iceland has led the way, globally, in terms of testing and accumulating scientific knowledge through genetic sequencing of the virus. The academic contribution of the paper concerns its broadening of understanding concerning systemic risk, which extends beyond financial implications to includes sustainability dimensions. For policymakers and practitioners, the paper highlights successful risk mitigation and science-based measures that will be useful for any nation tackling a future pandemic, regardless of whether they are island states, Arctic nations or another country.

AB  - Urban mobility systems are facing far-reaching structural transformations: There is the challenge of managing the growing volume of traffic and the associated environmental and social problems. On the one hand, novel micro-mobility services such as light electric vehicles (LEVs) show high potential for reducing emissions, e.g., through increased energy efficiency. On the other hand, they require change of urban mobility systems, e.g., through increasing shared concepts. The mixed methods approach is considered a good methodology for exploring the transformation of urban mobility systems since it can help to answer both technical and societal questions. Two transdisciplinary projects using the mixed method design were evaluated to improve the research for future mobility. To provide a critical reflection of the projects, a catalog of quality criteria was used to evaluate the research. This catalog was evaluated using structured interviews with project participants from research, practice and civil society. The results show that the combination of applied methods enables a comprehensive multi-perspective sustainability evaluation of urban micro-mobility concepts. The need for an early participatory research design was also evaluated. The result is an exemplary research design and a methodological guideline for the successful application of mixed methods for transformation research in the field of urban mobility systems.

AB  - Purpose - This chapter introduces this book's topics, purpose, and key themes. It summarizes the main objective of this book which is to examine the trends in corporate social responsibility (CSR) and sustainability in developing and emerging economies.
   Methodology/approach - This chapter reviews the extant literature and chapters and offers conceptual development. Findings Discussion on CSR and sustainability concepts is growing in developing countries, and many stakeholders including businesses, governments, and universities are working toward achieving sustainability. In addition, it is well documented that multinational enterprises (MNEs) operating in developing economies contribute significantly to job creation, growth and development, and poverty alleviation. However, when compared to developed countries there is a general perception that companies, in particular MNEs, do not pay much attention to CSR and sustainability issues. The lack of sophisticated institutional developments and capability in many developing economies compound the situation. Thus, business CSR and sustainability practices play a major role in improving stakeholder relationships. Practical and social implications This chapter suggests that in order for developing and emerging economies to move forward and achieve the gains from globalization; businesses, governments, and other stakeholders should work together to benefit from the various initiatives on CSR and sustainability jointly put together for the betterment of the citizens and a prosperous economy.
   Originality/value - This chapter contributes to the debate on trends in CSR and sustainability in developing/emerging economies by critically examines what the notions really mean in developing and emerging economies. It emphasizes that CSR and sustainability mean contributing to the well-being of citizens and respond positively to various stakeholder demands by improving the host countries and communities through participation in economic progress, social well-being, improvement in environmental practices, and involvement in citizens' empowerment and institutional building.

AB  - Extant project management literature suggests that project benefits management (PBM) can facilitate social sustainability (SS) through benefits formulation for a wider set of project stakeholders. However, empirical evidence regarding the actual extent of SS considerations in benefits formulation is lacking, especially from large developing economies like India. To fill this gap, a SS-centric analysis of PBM plans of 80 construction projects has been conducted using content analysis to identify the benefits targeted at the internal and external stakeholders, viz., workers and project-affected community. The analysis reveals much higher occurrences of benefits for the affected community compared to those relating to the workers. The project proponents have highlighted the social relevance of projects mostly through 'trickle down benefits' - that may possibly accrue to the affected communities due to project investment - as compared to 'co-created benefits' - that empower the affected communities but require a deeper understanding of their needs and aspirations. 'Local employment' and 'local business and economic growth' are the most common benefits across projects. Three areas of improvement have been suggested in the benefits formulation process from a SS perspective - mandating worker-specific benefits, more focus on co-created benefits and specifying numeric measures of benefits along with timelines, to facilitate assessment of actual benefits realization during project implementation and operation phases. This study contributes to research literature on sustainable project management. Its findings offer useful implications for researchers, policymakers and project proponent organizations.

AB  - Supply chains are critical driving forces behind business competitive advantages, hence their sustain ability measurement and management is vital. Determining the sustainability performance of supply chains is challenging. It requires appropriate tools for capturing and analyzing data for every supply chain activity and for each sustainability aspect. This study analyzes measurement approaches that are used to assess sustainability performance of supply chains. Using Content, Context and Process framework, we have studied 104 peer-reviewed articles, published in the literature on sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) and green supply chain management (GSCM). The results show that various measurement approaches are used to assess sustainability in different sectors and supply chain echelons. The application of multi-criteria decision-making methods is increasing and several promising measurement frameworks have been proposed. The most used approaches include Life Cycle Assessment, Analytical Hierarchy Process, Fuzzy set approach, Balance Scorecard, and Data envelopment analysis. Additionally, this study proposes a novel conceptual framework and provides a concise guideline for assessing sustainability of supply chains. Key challenges that need to be solved by future measurement approaches include sustainability data collection and sharing, metrics standardization, and collaboration among supply chain members per se and stakeholders. This study creates better comprehension of how existing approaches evaluate sustainability of supply chains and provides new insights into sustainability performance measurement approaches, supply chain configuration, and metrics selection.

AB  - Societies aiming for a sustainable future need more effective and legitimate planning and decision making practices, in which various actors together find pathways towards a sustainable transition. In this paper, we approach sustainability and environmental justice as epistemological (and ontological) challenges for land-use planning, and empirically analyse how action research could support planners' social learning and planning towards fair and sustainable development. We analysed qualitatively the evolution of the researcher-planner dialogue while co-designing and developing better methods, means and practices to improve environmental justice in regional scale planning in Kymenlaakso Region, South-East Finland. We found that researcher-planner dialogue developed during cooperation. While in the beginning, social learning related to approaching environmental justice as a fair distribution of power evolved incrementally, later, when dialogue became more focused, communicative and reflective as an outcome of mutual frames and trust, learning occurred in a more transformative way. Such transformative learning concerned recognising youth as a silent group in the planning process and the means to involve their perceptions in planning. In order to support sustainability transformation in the future, we conclude that it is essential to create opportunities for such incremental and transformative social learning through innovative modes of interaction in various contexts.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to investigate the influence of environmental disclosure and corporate governance on the financial performance of Islamic banks in Saudi Arabia. This study highlights that sustainable practices are transparent with financial objectives using the religious framework of Islamic finance. This research is based on Worldwide Vision 2030, which covers sustainable development and promotes environmental, social, and governance (ESG) principles, as well as corporate governance factors, such as board composition and Shariah Supervisory Boards (SSBs). We use a hybrid approach for our findings, with a dataset spanning 2011-2023 for the quantitative analysis and 20 semi-structured analyses conducted for a qualitative approach that aligns with objectives. We found that environmental disclosure boosts profits and stakeholder trust. Corporate governance structures, such as environmental boards and sustainability committees, improve the environmental disclosure of financial performance in Islamic banks. In this positive interaction, specialized governance drives Sharia-compliant sustainability initiatives. SSBs help Islamic banks integrate sustainability and meet religious and ESG environmental standards. Board diversity and dedication in the sustainability committee both play important roles in enhancing environmental disclosure practices; in return, these improved financial performances. The interaction of environmental disclosure and board environmental expertise has a positive impact on the overall performance, which indicates that governance structure supports sustainability-related decision-making, aligning with transparency. This study suggests that Islamic banks standardize ESG frameworks, improve board environmental expertise, and invest in real-time sustainability reporting digital solutions. Saudi Islamic banks can lead regional and global sustainable banking by adopting these strategies to align with global sustainability trends, improve financial performance, and meet ethical finance expectations.

AB  - Ensuring sustainable consumption and production (SCP) patterns is an important task for achieving Sustainable Development Goal 12 by 2030. To facilitate international and domestic collaboration toward regional SCP, we developed a collaborative workshop method to generate and structure ideas about consumption and production (CP) patterns and employed the procedures for emerging Southeast Asian countries at workshops in Japan and Thailand. The main focus was on Bangkok, and the goal was to identify the implications of SCP policies. The structuring of seventeen SCP patterns chosen from 525 CP patterns generated at the workshops helped to identify the important influential factors, policy interventions, and features of probable SCP patterns. The main conclusions were the following: (1) The viewpoints of consumers and providers are important for idea generation. The products and services, as well as the systems of CP patterns, should be targeted; (2) Transition, improvement of the quality of life, and digitalization are also key directions of SCP patterns in Bangkok; (3) Culture, infrastructure, and industry are major considerations for regional SCP policy; and (4) SCP policy instruments are broader than conventional environmental policy instruments, and expanding the scope of SCP policy should be discussed more widely, especially in Asian countries.

AB  - The importance of collaborative approaches to governing social-ecological systems (SES) towards more transformative outcomes is now widely acknowledged. Theoretical and meth- odological frameworks to enable such collaborations are being developed across a range of disciplines. Transdisciplinary approaches are emerging as a key enabler of potentially trans- formative collaborations in SES, particularly where these are characterized by 'multiple multi- ples' (e.g. multiple scales, knowledge systems, etc.). A typical approach to studying complex collaborative initiatives across a range of contexts is comparative case study research, often relying on researchers embedded in cases. In this approach, qualitative case studies are coded using predetermined variables (based on ecological, social, and social-ecological features of cases) to enable comparison and cross-case analysis. In our experience, the process of coding qualitative cases into a quantitative analysis framework can be hampered by what we term 'sticky variables', i.e. variables which are difficult to code for reasons related to aspects of the intrinsic complexity of social-ecological systems. Based on cases from a range of geographic locations across the Global North and South, we identify sticky variables, and elucidate the reasons for their 'stickiness'. We propose several ways of working with and learning from sticky variables, and we reflect on theoretical, methodological and reflexive aspects of transdisciplinary research on collaborations. Moreover, we suggest that sticky variables might be 'flags' for interesting underlying factors that influence collaboration. We conclude by drawing out recommendations for researchers and practitioners confronted with the complexities and nuances of collaborations in social-ecological systems around the world.

AB  - The transformations required to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals across the African continent demand new ways of mobilising, weaving together, and applying knowledge. Research, policymaking, planning, and action must be effectively inter-linked to address complex sustainability challenges and the different needs and interests of societal actors. Transdisciplinarity (TD) - the co-production of knowledge across disciplines and with non-academic actors - offers a promising, holistic approach to foster such transformations. Yet, despite increased application of TD over the past two decades, disciplinary and sectoral silos persist. TD is not well embedded in African academic institutions and, consequently, much SDG-related research is too narrowly framed and divorced from the action space to be effective. There is an urgent need to work collectively across disciplines and society for transformation towards more sustainable and equitable development pathways. Capacities to undertake collaborative, impactful research must be strengthened, and changes in research culture are needed to support relationship building. We explore these issues by drawing on two recent online social learning processes with researchers and practitioners working on sustainability issues and TD. In each process, we built on actors' own experiences of TD by investigating institutional, practical, and theoretical challenges and enablers of TD. Here, we synthesise our learnings, alongside key literature, and explore avenues to better: a) promote and support TD within academic institutions across Africa; b) resource TD for sustainable partnerships, and c) strengthen TD practices and impacts to support transformation to sustainability across diverse places and contexts.

AB  - There is evidence that sustainability and efficiency are challenges for mobile learning adoption methods. The objective of this study is to identify, categorize and evaluate the critical factors that shape the adoption and sustainable use of mobile learning.. The study will investigate the factors that affect mobile learning adoption, how they can be categorized and what is the prioritization of these categories in the context of Catalonia. The research in this study was designed according to a mixed methods paradigm applying a mixed research approach weighted toward quantitative data, including a literature review, a systematic review, and an expert judgement. A total of 361 factors were identified by reviewing 74 studies; twenty-six studies were included in the systematic review; and seven Catalan experts participated in the expert trial, including three school leaders, two university experts and two education inspectors. This study provides a taxonomy to categorize and orchestrate the factors affecting the adoption of mobile learning providing a holistic and coherent vision.. This categorization contributes to improving sustainability in the adoption of mobile learning. Overall, participants prioritize the five categories from the most challenging to the lowest impact as follows: leadership; personal character, attitudes, and ethics; digital literacy; pedagogical; and technological resources. The major limitation of this study is the lack of contextualization of the proposed categorization. Future research should offer different perspectives in order to generalize the results. Findings may vary with technological advances. The findings are expected to be useful both in academia and for school stakeholders as insights for further research and efficient and sustainable mobile learning adoptions.

AB  - The Western Wildlife Corridor (WWC) in Ghana's Northern Savannah ecological zone is a contested landscape where efforts to reverse widespread environmental degradation often conflict with local livelihood concerns and broader development objectives. Despite policy measures to devolve natural resource decision-making authority, poor environmental management, persistent socioeconomic challenges, and increasingly limited livelihood opportunities for people living within the corridor prevail. This study investigates environmental degradation in the WWC and natural resource governance using information on stakeholder perceptions from stakeholder workshops, focus group discussions, and key informant interviews. We also explore how natural resource management might be strengthened to better deliver social, economic, and environmental goals. We found that despite a history of contestation, stakeholders were able to agree upon specific issues of common concern and generate a collaborative vision for the WWC landscape. Transitioning toward such a vision requires significant investment in strengthening current governance structures and building natural resource management capacity within the corridor and beyond. Furthermore, persistent challenges of conflicting stakeholder objectives and issues related to coordination, corruption, and non-inclusion in decision-making about natural resources must be addressed to advance progress. Stakeholders were able to formulate specific recommendations and a participatory theory of change to inform the development of a sustainable landscape management plan and future evidence-based policy that could steer the WWC toward a more resilient and multifunctional system that equitably supports livelihoods, biodiversity, and wider economic development. The methods for inclusive engagement in environmental decision-making are extrapolatable to other contexts facing similar social-environmental challenges.

AB  - This study explores how rural community travel can be an eco-innovation approach to enhance education for sustainable development (ESD) for 2030. The goal of ESD is to enable all-age learners to meet the Sustainable Development Goal 4 (SDG 4); therefore, effective education related to sustainability with respect to the local cultural context has become an urgent issue. Sustainability is not a specific problem, but concerns all living stakeholders, what they think, and how they work for sustainable community development. However, the intrinsic mechanism regarding the psychological process of outside responsible behavior change is still ignored. Therefore, we conducted a case study, wherein we selected a local cocoa cultural industry festival in southern Taiwan to understand the role of sustainability learning to explain this mechanism. The findings revealed that, in general, sustainability learning is a complex and reflexive process interlinked with different learners (stakeholders); it combines individual psychology and behavior, e.g., in positive psychology, learners care about the low-carbon services provided to tourists, and in negative psychology, they care more about finances. Notably, positive psychology affects responsible behavior, thus, promoting the preservation of the living environment. Additionally, we deduced that ESD can be enhanced by involving human senses and positive psychology.

AB  - Background
   Community participation in water and sanitation is one of the prominent global indicators used to assess the achievement of water-related sustainable developmental goals. The participation by the community mostly depends on the way the community perceives their water source quality.
   Objective
   To measure the community perception regarding the quality of water concerning both drinking and domestic use and testing these perceptions with biochemical confirmation in a rural area of South India.
   Methods
   An exploratory sequential mixed-methods study design, comprising an initial cross-sectional quantitative study followed by qualitative field observations and in-depth interviews, was conducted to assess the community perceptions on the quality of water for drinking water and domestic use. Water samples were collected from 16 different sites and assessed for various biochemical parameters using standard guidelines. Quantitative data were reported using proportions and qualitative data was reported using categories and verbatim quotes.
   Results
   A total of 82 households were included in the survey. Among these households, 67% of the households used 'open dug well' as the source of their drinking water. None of the households was practising any purification method for drinking water. The community perceived the water quality to be good with no complaints but the perception of drinking water quality was based on sensorial factors like 'smell and colour' for drinking water and 'patches', and 'good lather and no stains' for domestic water use and not based on health or microbial quality of water. Biochemical analysis showed that biological oxygen demand and chemical oxygen demand were not within the prescribed standards in all the samples indicating considerable pollution. The deviation was more in 'stored samples' compared to 'source samples in all the water sources.
   Conclusion
   The study showed that community perception on water quality matched in a few aspects with biochemical confirmation but not all characteristics or beliefs were concurrent with biochemical analysis. There is a need to increase awareness regarding water, sanitation, and hygiene practices especially among women in the community, who are the primary stakeholders.

AB  - Purpose This study intends to test the relationship between banks' board diversity, detected with age and gender characteristics, and banks' social performance. The resource dependence theory posits that board diversity is a strategic tool able to enrich the board of directors by expanding skills and the number of links with stakeholders, which have a strategic role in achieving a competitive advantage and sustainable goals, especially in the banking sector. Design/methodology/approach The research hypotheses are tested using a sample of 46 European banks observed from 2009 to 2017. The gender and age diversity data of bank board members are hand-collected from banks' social reports. Findings The empirical results show that bank social performance is positively influenced by board gender and age diversity. Thus, the human capital determined by a higher bank's board diversity constitutes an essential resource for adopting more sustainable business models. Originality/value This paper analyses the association between board diversity and social performance, providing empirical evidence for the European banking sector in the period after the 2008 global financial crisis. The banking literature provides scarce evidence on the topic; however, the empirical results claim the strategic importance of the appointment of directors to the banks' boards to balance corporate strategy with social and environmental issues generating a positive impact on sustainable growth.

AB  - Purpose The paper aims to examine the current status and development of sustainable development in Finnish engineering education. Design/methodology/approach The study consists of interviews with key stakeholders supplemented with the analysis of documented material. Development is discussed in relation to the findings of collaborative strategy process in the year 2009. Findings The paper observes that the Finnish universities providing engineering education are committed to sustainable development in their strategies. However, a lot of work remains to be done before the strategies are implemented and sustainable development is integrated to all degree programs. Explicit knowledge and individual learning in clearly defined disciplinary boundaries have been the main focus of engineering education. Practical implications The paper suggests that engineers need to be provided with mental tools to cope with uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity. Key competencies include holistic understanding, communication and collaboration skills, ability and willingness for critical and reflective thinking, creativity, innovativeness and entrepreneurship. Thus, collaborative learning, open dialogue and innovation are at the heart of education for sustainable development. Originality/value This paper has a relatively wide approach as it analyses sustainable development in the context of Finnish engineering education both on institutional and societal levels and is based on a national project.

AB  - Applying artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and big data to natural resource management (NRM) is revolutionizing how natural resources are managed. To gain more insights into the domain, we use 394 Scopus-indexed documents to explore the thematic evolution and explore future research directions. We found that the topics related to AI, ML, and big data for natural resource management have increased significantly since 2012. While "Remote Sensing" is the most productive journal, S. Alqadhi and J. Mallick are the most contributing authors, and the United States has been the most contributing country. While the keywords "sustainable development" and "remote sensing" have been growing steadily since 1975, "natural resource modeling" and "machine learning" have been more popular during the last few years. The thematic analysis reveals that the existing literature is concentrated around four clusters, and the content analysis of the clusters uncovers 15 future research agendas. These research agendas include the development of efficient strategies for NRM, understanding the role of AI and ML in natural resource management, leveraging data-driven methods for decision making, and developing models for interdisciplinary and cross-sectoral approaches. The study provides important implications of using technology in NRM. These technologies help policymakers create effective policies, improves assessment and decision-making, and optimizes resource use. These advancements benefit society by increasing access to essential resources in a fair manner, and they have positive impacts on both the public and private sectors, enabling evidence-based policymaking and responsible resource extraction. Collaboration and investment in these technologies are crucial for achieving sustainable development and preserving natural resources for future generations.

AB  - With the ever-increasing climate change, actions to reduce its negative impact while improving food and nutrition security are critical. This review is a retrospective analysis of climate adaptation strategies and implications for food and nutrition security among small-scale farmers in South Africa. The review used bibliometric analysis and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis to track research on implications of adaptation on food and nutrition security, identify adaptation strategies with implications on food and nutrition security and discuss the implications. The analysis shows a steady growth in the research field; however, whether the pace will accelerate the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 2 by 2030 is unknown. Institutional research collaboration is notable, although weak. The co-occurrence of keywords reflects Climate-Smart Agriculture and food and nutrition linkages, emphasizes the importance of farmers' perceptions on adopting measures to enhance food and nutrition security and illustrates the risk-vulnerability-resilience nexus. Adaptation measures with implications on food and nutrition security are varied, ranging from individual efforts to government-led initiatives. We recommend strengthening institutional research collaboration to accelerate the pace towards achieving zero hunger, food security and nutrition by 2030. It is also important to have an inclusive policy framework that addresses farmers' adaptation needs.

AB  - Sustainability transition projects (STPs) employ specialist knowledge and learning to lever changes for the communities with which they engage. Research into these forms of organizations often focuses on engagement practices and their relative success or failure to facilitate local transitions toward sustainability. What has attracted comparatively less attention, however, is how STPs develop their own sense of expertise in this role as a broker of Mode-2 knowledge or their own understanding about what it is that they are doing in facilitating community-scale changes. Privileging an emphasis on language-in-use research in organizational theory, this study analyzed the transcriptions of facilitated action research (AR) meetings of a case study STP by applying text mining methods in conjunction with a thematic analysis, the latter exploring insights gained across themes of governance, delivery, networks, challenges, and learning. The findings from these analyses are discussed with reference to how the case study STP staff group construes their work in the domain of sustainability and the generation and acquisition of relevant knowledge and learning in this specialized subsector of community development.

AB  - IntroductionIn childhood intervention, parent-therapist collaboration is central to the family-centred approach. Despite long-standing discussion in occupational therapy literature, the field faces challenges, including inconsistent terminology and difficulties in translating theory into practice. This paper represents the first part of a comprehensive scoping review study aimed at developing foundational concepts for collaborative practices with parents in occupational therapy for children. Therefore, this paper focusses on mapping existing practices, types, and approaches articulated in the literature.MethodsWe searched English-language sources published worldwide from 1998 to 2022 discussing collaborative practices with parents in occupational therapy for children aged 0-10 with any diagnosis, including multidisciplinary practices. Seven databases were searched. Data from peer-reviewed indexed literature, theses and dissertations, and book chapters were extracted and analysed through basic numerical and descriptive analyses before being synthesised into similar categories. The Joanna Briggs Institute Manual and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis-extension for Scoping Reviews were used.ResultsThe scoping review yielded 299 papers. Parent-therapist collaboration was prominent in clinics, family homes, schools, and hospitals, particularly during therapy implementation, goal setting, and planning. Most reported practice types included 'interventions with parent engagement', 'parent-directed interventions', and 'parent education'. 'Family-centred', 'occupational-focussed', and 'client-therapist collaborative' approaches were frequently mentioned. There were inconsistencies in the terms used to describe collaborative practice characteristics.ConclusionOver the past 24 years, the collaborative practice literature has expanded and evolved, with parent-therapist collaboration observed across various occupational therapy settings. Inconsistencies in this collaboration across different therapeutic stages were revealed, which could impact intervention success and sustainability. Further research is needed to explore parent-therapist collaboration mechanisms within and across stages. This scoping review also underscores the need for a common framework to guide practice and research.PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARYThis literature review explores how occupational therapists and parents work together in childhood intervention. Collaboration is essential for understanding and meeting children's needs within their family and community settings. However, occupational therapists and parents face challenges in applying family-centred practices and using a common language to bridge theory with practice. To address these challenges, we examined 299 papers published between 1998 and 2022 to understand how collaborative practices with parents have been described in the literature. Our review revealed that therapists and parents collaborate across various settings, such as clinics, schools, homes, and hospitals, mainly during therapy sessions, goal setting, and planning interventions. Collaborative practices take different forms. For instance, therapists often encourage parents to actively engage and take the lead in therapy, requiring therapists to recognise and respect parents' priorities and learning preferences. They often develop strategies together to support the child within family routines.
   While we found several studies on therapist-parent collaboration, the review outlined inconsistencies in how this practice was described and applied, which could affect its success. Therefore, more research is needed to understand the best ways in which collaboration can occur at each stage of therapy. The need for a core guideline for collaborative practice with parents in occupational therapy was also observed. While therapist-parent collaboration is used in occupational therapy for children, there is a clear need to minimise inconsistencies and gaps found in the literature, as well as to ensure a common language to promote intervention quality and success.

AB  - Background. Whether concepts and principles of Occupational Therapy (OT) can successfully be applied to non-Western and cross-cultural settings is being intensively discussed. Aims/Objectives. We explored the changing perspectives of local occupational therapists (OTs) eight years after the implementation of an OT service in a Himalayan cross-cultural setting in terms of (1) treatment applied, (2) professional identity, and (3) cross-cultural interactions. Material and Methods. A qualitative study design was chosen, and semistructured interviews were conducted in all employed practitioners (a) during implementation and (b) eight years later n=7. Questions were carefully formulated in order to narrow down the intended issues but respecting crosscultural differences. The framework method was implemented for data analysis. Findings. Long-term empowering local OTs resulted in the successful development of a sustainable OT department in a unique Himalayan cross-cultural setting. Practitioners became aware of their therapeutic potentials, a clear sense of professional identity was developed, and it was recognised that sensitive cross-cultural practice is only achieved by an ongoing and intentional cultural learning process. Conclusions and Significance. Our findings suggest that OT can be applied to non-Western cross-cultural settings.

AB  - Non-technical summary The design of food systems is a common theme that requires stakeholders to prioritize long-term perspectives and balance between benefits for the present and future generations. Building on this theme, this study aims to demonstrate an intervention in individuals' policy preferences by helping them voluntarily adopt values for long-term policies and assessing its effectiveness through online deliberation experiments involving randomly selected consumers. The findings indicate that interventions incorporating the concept of imaginary future generations significantly influence individuals' food preferences and values.Technical summary Food systems are indispensable for the survival of the present generation and simultaneously have various effects on future generations. Therefore, the design of food systems is a typical theme requiring stakeholders to find value in a long-term perspective that achieves an appropriate balance between the benefits for the present and future generations. In this context, this study aims to demonstrate an intervention in individuals' policy preferences by assisting them in voluntarily acquiring values for long-term policies and verifying their effectiveness through online deliberation experiments with randomly selected food consumers (n = 153). The intervention used the future design method and the core concept of imaginary future people. The topic of this experimental study is policies on rice production and consumption in Japan. The findings suggest that interventions that incorporate the concept of imaginary future generations significantly influence individuals' food preferences and values, encouraging a shift toward a sustainable system through fundamental transformation rather than maintaining the current status quo. Based on these results, the authors discuss a pathway toward achieving a sustainable food system, in which collaborative efforts that transcend the individual positions of stakeholders are driven by forming a group identity among individuals willing to adopt the viewpoint of future generations.Social media summary The design of food systems is a common theme that requires stakeholders to prioritize long-term perspectives and balance between benefits for the present and future generations.

AB  - In the community of San Ignacio in the Ecuadorian Andes, an intervention project was carried out with the aim of improving their socioeconomic capacities through different actions designed with the inhabitants in a participative manner. In order to analyze the effect of the actions undertaken, the impact on sustainability before and after the intervention was evaluated using the framework for the evaluation of natural resource management systems (MESMIS). Twelve indicators were selected to measure the project's areas of influence on the performance of the 22 production units and the capacities of their managers. Of the 12 indicators, the perception of empowerment indicator is proposed for the first time within the framework of the MESMIS program as a strategic indicator to explore in depth the factors that influence gender equality. Based on the differences found in these indicators, it could be seen that the intervention had a positive effect on the sustainability of the system, significantly improving the indices referring to functional biodiversity, mainly due to women's activity, and access to technological innovations. Although the actions did not appear to significantly influence gender equality, the new proposed strategic indicator leads to a greater understanding of gender perspective, which meant that factors such as dread, independence and satisfaction improved after the intervention process. Lastly, a medium- and long-term evaluation is recommended in order to confirm the effects of the intervention project within a suitable timeframe.

AB  - Social involvement of enterprises, i.e., sharing wealth with those in need, can be spoken of only in the case of owner-managed family firms (FB). These companies account for two-thirds of all enterprises in the global economy; they contribute to the stability, development, and continuity of the existence of the economies of many countries. However, the sustainability of the existence of individual FBs is often threatened. Social engagement of owners and preparation of successors are the appropriate retort as they affect the transgenerational sustainability of these enterprises. The purpose of this study is to identify the causes, scope, forms, and beneficiaries of social engagement of Polish FBs. The study uses the Delphi method implemented in three stages: (1) selection of experts; (2) collection of information; and (3) development and interpretation of research results in the context of adopted research questions, research objective, and research hypothesis. The results of the study confirm that FBs make an important contribution to sustainable social development at the micro level. The social engagement of FBs brings benefits to both beneficiaries and donors, responds to genuinely existing needs, and supports the cross-generational sustainability of companies.

AB  - Purpose - Curricula is developing from a pure knowledge-based outcome to a more skill-based outcome, with the objective of creating and advancing competencies that meet employer expectations. While the new Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) demand organisations to change practices and adapt to sustainable goals, there is a lack of understanding in how competencies can enhance these goals. The purpose of this paper is twofold: Study 1 explores competencies related to sustainability required in a work force and examines employer perceptions on the existing literature for competencies. Study 2 empirically tests the influence of sustainability scholarship on non-technical competencies in the work force.
   Design/methodology/approach - A mixed method approach was undertaken. A sample of managers from 39 large Australian organisations participated in the scoping study. This was followed by further interviewing executives from 12 multinational corporations in China to assess the validity of competencies and provide deeper understanding of the issues at hand. The quantitative study analysed a sample of executive responses from 229 multinationals in China using factor and regression analysis to test for the effects of mediation.
   Findings - The research highlights that the underlying competencies regarding sustainability influences the bigger picture within firms for attaining sustainability. The affective and cognitive growth of sustainability scholarship is governed mainly by a firm's sustainable values. Core organisational values facilitate the development of non-technical competencies. These relationships and their cumulative effect on competencies provide a theoretical framework for acquiring sustainability within organisations. Employees need sustainability scholarship for enhancing sustainability. Sustainability scholarship reflects high-level learning obtained through universities or training. The research found that non-technical competencies such as professional ethical responsibility mediate between core business competencies and sustainability scholarship.
   Originality/value - By exploring employer's perception of competencies, the study first makes an important contribution in addressing the need to support SDGs by bridging organisational-level competencies and sustainability literacy, which hold significant benefits for practitioners, academia and organisations at large. Second, the theoretical findings strengthen the need for embedding competencies in the curriculum. It conveys the need for sustainability literacy/scholarship to align with organisational training and learning pedagogies, in order to effectively meet industry needs. Third, it provides useful insights on employers' estimation about workplace competencies and broadens our understanding on the contribution that competencies within organisations make to this end.

AB  - Climate change and sustainability science have become more international in scope and transdisciplinary in nature, in response to growing expectations that scientific knowledge directly informs collective action and transformation. In this article, we move past idealized models of the science-policy interface to examine the social processes and geopolitical dynamics of knowledge mobilization. We argue that sociotechnical imaginaries of transdisciplinary research, deployed in parallel to universal regimes of evidence-based decision-making from the global North, conceal how international collaborations of scientists and societal actors actually experience knowledge mobilization, its systemic barriers, and its paths to policy action. Through ethnographic study of a transdisciplinary research program in the Americas, coupled with in-depth analysis of Colombia, we reveal divergences in how participants envision and experience knowledge mobilization and identify persistent disparities that diminish the capacity of researchers to influence decision-making and fit climate knowledge within broader neoliberal development paradigms. Results of the study point to a plurality of science-policy interface(s), each shaped by national sociotechnical imaginaries, development priorities, and local social orders. We conclude that a geopolitical approach to transdisciplinary science is necessary to understand how climate and sustainability knowledge circulates unevenly in a world marked by persistent inequality and dominance.

AB  - Over the last several decades, the European Union (EU) has championed recycling and sustainable waste management through Directives 2008/98/EC and 2018/851, shaping practices across its member states. Currently, 30% of the EU's municipal waste is recycled, 19% composted, 23% incinerated, and 23% landfilled. However, regional variations exist within the EU, with Greece and other Mediterranean/Balkan nations favoring landfilling, while Germany and other Western/Central EU nations prioritize recycling and composting, and Nordic countries lean toward incineration. To address these differences, a new sustainability point system was created in order to evaluate and compare all different municipal waste management strategies of EU members. Notably, countries like Germany, the Netherlands, and Sweden score the highest due to low municipal waste generation, high recycling rates (>35%), minimal landfilling (<1%), and significant incineration. In contrast, Cyprus, Malta, and Greece score lower due to landfill reliance and lower recycling rates. Therefore, this study introduces a novel sustainability point system to mitigate disparities, highlighting the need for targeted interventions and policy initiatives at the national and EU levels. By leveraging these insights, policymakers can allocate resources effectively, foster collaboration, and motivate citizens to achieve common environmental goals as well as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

AB  - Urban green spaces, including parks, plazas, and squares, are essential components of healthy and sustainable cities. These areas play a central role in enhancing the wellbeing of citizens, fostering social interactions, and promoting sustainable urban development. This study investigates the multifaceted benefits of integrating green spaces into urban environments, such as improving physical and mental health, facilitating social engagement, and supporting environmental sustainability. Despite these benefits, the development and maintenance of urban green spaces face significant challenges, including limited suitable land, financial constraints, and inadequate access, which can exclude certain populations from enjoying these green havens. The study examines specific case studies, including Linyi People's Park, Lanshan Youth Park, and Yumin Park, to highlight the factors contributing to the success or failure of these spaces. It also draws inspiration from international examples like New York City's High Line and Germany's Emscher Landscape Park, which have successfully transformed neglected areas into vibrant green oases. The findings underscore the importance of adopting principles of spatial justice, resource management, urban policy revision, and access reform to ensure the equitable distribution and accessibility of urban green spaces. The study concludes with key recommendations for urban planning and public health policy, aiming to enhance the wellbeing of citizens and strengthen the harmonious relationship between urban development and the natural environment. This study explores the multifaceted benefits of urban green spaces, including parks and plazas, highlighting their critical roles in enhancing physical and mental health, fostering social interactions, and promoting environmental sustainability. Through in-depth case studies of Linyi People's Park, Lanshan Youth Park, and Yumin Park, the research identifies key factors contributing to the success and challenges of these spaces. Innovations in the study include a holistic analysis of green space benefits, a focus on spatial justice for equitable access, and comparative insights from international examples like New York City's High Line and Germany's Emscher Landscape Park. The research identifies several gaps, including the need for longitudinal studies on health impacts, understanding socioeconomic and cultural variability in green space use, evaluating the effectiveness of policy interventions, exploring technological integration, assessing environmental and economic trade-offs, and developing models for community engagement and ownership. Addressing these gaps will enhance strategies for integrating green spaces into urban environments, ensuring their benefits are accessible to all citizens.

AB  - Saudi Arabia's Ministry of Health (MOH) use corporate performance improvement methodologies to develop and implement performance improvement initiatives designed to continue building on the Ministry's vision of transforming hospital operations and instituting a culture of quality and performance focused on the "patient first" principle. We evaluated the feasibility of setting up a performance improvement unit (PIU) within the MOH to apply the principles of Lean Six Sigma and to change management methodologies. The MOH collaborated with external consultants to implement PIU initiatives in 4 steps: PIU Setup, PIU Capability Building, High-Impact Project Implementation, and Project Sustainability and Knowledge Transfer. PIU units were setup across the 13 provinces over 90 days. The process included the promotion of knowledge sharing to strengthen the skill set of Saudi health care professionals and develop local performance improvement champions within the MOH who could lead, implement, and sustain future projects. Implementation was a challenge; though, early results from the High-Impact Project Implementation phase were encouraging. However, the sustainability of PIU interventions was poor, with performance improvement processes returning to baseline levels within 9 months. This case study shows that PIU implementation is a feasible approach for improving health care delivery in Saudi Arabia. Poor sustainability despite initial success highlights the need to further improve the engagement, incentivization, and training of team leaders and members to achieve long-term success with the program.

AB  - Global environmental challenges are increasingly complex and interdependent and the sentiment that sustainability requires new approaches to integrating science and policy is ubiquitous. This is the domain of sustainability science. Yet, major gaps exist in our understanding of the relationships between researchers from different disciplines and between science, policy, and management. While scientific research is shifting toward greater collaboration and transdisciplinarity, we need to improve our understanding of the processes and structures that lead to successful scientific collaboration and high-impact, innovative science-policy outcomes. 'Networks and networking' offer a powerful strategy for integration in sustainability science, yet empirical research assessing network-based integration is limited. Using social network analysis, we empirically investigate the integration of the Texas Water Research Network (TWRN), which comprises academic and non-academic participants from multiple universities, disciplines and research orientations seeking to address the challenges posed by complex, multilevel water resource issues across the state of Texas. We found that TWRN members were relatively well connected (an average of 3.8 ties per member), but that some research groups (e.g. water science) were way more active and connected than others (e.g. scenario building). Within the different phases of the research process, bringing results to fruition was the most transdisciplinary. Utilizing analytical methods from network science can offer techniques to analyze and evaluate, as well as prescribe interventions and enable action in transdiciplinary research networks.

AB  - This article analyses role of the concept of "public interest" in forest management, governance and conservation in Turkey and seeks to obtain an insight into the "public interest" through exploring the permit process given by the State, and to help better understanding the roots of current issues. An institutional approach will be followed and various formal and informal legislation will be explored in their complex and dynamic interplay, which leads and shapes practices on the ground and resulting outcomes. The purpose of this paper is to bring some new perspectives to the debate about the proper balance between economic development policies and forest protection. It is also hypothesized that the concept of "public interest" could increase and lead deforestation through legislation. It first explains the theoretical framework on resource management, forest policy, and public interest. This general overview is followed by a more in-depth analysis of the role that public interest plays in deforestation via the permit process in the State forests. Turkey has lost irrevocably an area of 654.833 hectares in the State forests via the 94.148 permits granted. This analysis of public interest confirms that it is important to avoid legislation that overreaches. The concept of public interest may exceed implementation capacity (i.e., there may be an imbalance between the activities, procedures and institutional arrangements prescribed by legislation and high court decisions). Re-organization of decision-making mechanisms/process with a more participative approach is an important step toward achieving good governance and sustainability of the forest resources.

AB  - Purpose
   The purpose of this paper is to test possibilities of real participation in FM field in response to the energy sustainable demand by using new technologies for better communication. It is acknowledged that the technological innovation is a necessary condition to make a city sustainable, though the challenge is not primarily on technology but on service transformation and improvement. Improving service quality requires the participatory and synergetic processes that attract an extra attention to the social and management aspects of urban planning.
   Design/methodology/approach
   This is an evidence-based research, which shows how FM can extent its impact on the build environment and society by bringing the socio-physiological aspect and the community in the central of the planning and design process.
   Findings
   An "urban" facility manager, through integration of multiple disciplines in a human-centre approach, can become the enabler and implementer of sustainable urban ecosystem, i.e. balancing social, economic and environmental pillars. This requires central involvement of FM in the planning and decision-making processes; therefore, its role and impact should be enlarged and better communicated. The enlargement of the FM's role initially requires an effective communication with people, whose behavioural change are prerequisite for the sustainability transition. The communication between FM and people should be interactive and iterative, in which they both define problems/needs and co-create the relevant solutions.
   Research limitations/implications
   This paper depicts an evidence-based FM practice, in which the website as an interactive tool is co-designed by the "facility management" students and the citizens to contribute to the real citizen participation in an effective communication process.
   Originality/value
   The high value for both, citizens and facility manager, is co-created information platform for upgrading the sustainability level and well-being in the communities. The tool is seen as an important starting contribution for the Paris climate agreement, and as a step toward human-centric-oriented urban sustainable regenerating project.

AB  - The study of peri-urbanization attracted attention in the final quarter of the 20th century, due to the pace it acquired worldwide and the implication that urbanization and overall settlement patterns have on social sustainability and development. Theoretical and conceptual achievements are remarkable. Multi-country collaboration has produced a growing body of research on sustainability and peri-urban settlements. There is a lack, however, of a review of the practices of peri-urban informal settlements, the predominant mode of urban expansion, mainly in developing and rapidly urbanizing regions of the world. The purpose is, then, to systematize, from recent literature, the knowledge of the context, challenges, and practices, as well as their impacts and potential courses of action, to ensure sustainability in human-natural complex of the territory beyond urban cores, suburbs, or slums. A systematic review approach was adopted, for articles published in reputable journals, with support of previous reviews, books, and reports. A pragmatist combination of content analysis and critical review identified core topics and highlighted contrasting views. An analytical framework is proposed. Four categories-drivers, challenges and practices, impact, and future trends-are proposed as an adequate approach to systematizing the literature. The review finds that the practices focus on service and resource provision, on regulations to approximate informal to formal institutions, and on an economy founded on the resource base and service provision. This review provides insights on future trends and research topics.

AB  - Purpose/objectives: In the absence of a socio-economic transformative business agenda, our purpose is to propose a transformative Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) management model for businesses in South Africa.Design/methodology: A case study design was followed, using document analysis and a questionnaire as data collection methods. Thirty respondents, representing nine businesses from the banking, food and telecommunication sectors, were sampled.Findings: The results suggest that businesses do not follow a systematic, uniform reporting format annually and do not fully comply with Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standards or B-BBEE compliance targets. Furthermore, no clear evidence could be found in the sampled companies' sustainability reports of how much money was contributed annually to socio-economic development, and no progressive CSR trends could be discerned.Practical implications: A practical model with guidelines is presented to assist South African businesses to successfully comply with statutory and regulatory obligations and international CSR reporting requirements.Originality/value: The proposed transformative CSR management model offers a tangible framework for businesses in the absence of such a framework. The main elements of the final model are the oversight and management of CSR and CSR activities, stakeholder management, intervention impact planning, stakeholder engagement, implementation, and sustainable impact reporting. This model can be implemented and used by various stakeholders in the business sector to accelerate tangible and sustainable socio-economic transformation in South Africa.

AB  - As the concept of Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) has evolved, governments and other stakeholders have pursued three important frameworks for defining and pursuing SFM: public land forest policies, Criteria and Indicators and certification. In Canada, these three approaches frequently operate simultaneously as policy frameworks for private firms managing forests on public lands. Harmonization of these three frameworks could create potential benefits by simplifying a complicated array of sometimes conflicting forest management standards. But there are also potential costs of harmonization that could arise out of the diverse conditions that embody SFM. The diversity of social values and ecological conditions associated with forests creates difficulties in designing processes that are representative of stakeholders' interests. Moreover, this variety poses challenges to designing standards that are sufficiently flexible to address local conditions, yet useful in contributing to SFM planning and reporting at regional, provincial and national scales. Within this context, we suggest that the diversity inherent in SFM will continue to be accommodated by multiple management frameworks, unless a single framework arises that shows itself capable of being trusted by stakeholders and of being sufficiently flexible to accommodate various definitions of Sustainable Forest Management.

AB  - Strategic narratives about the transition to sustainable energy systems, including those influenced by the United Nations' sustainable development goals (SDGs), frequently incorporate utopian elements. These ambitious targets encapsulate future-oriented visions and postulate implications of technological advancements; they also often underrepresent or even bypass the multifaceted nature of socioeconomic diversities, planetary constraints, and persistent energy disputes. The genre of utopian science fiction can offer a valuable heuristic to elucidate the heterogeneous and occasionally unsatisfactory projections that emerge from the SDGs. Two seminal novels-Ernest Callenbach's Ecotopia (1975) and Kim Stanley Robinson's The Ministry for the Future (2020)-which we classify as "fictional energy utopias" (FEUs), present incisive critiques of contemporary energy mechanisms and practices and envisage equitable, resilient, and robust renewable energy systems and socio-technical structures. Through an approach that combines narrative and discourse analyses, these literary works are juxtaposed with selected indicators of three SDGs. The ensuing study underscores the primacy of the topic of energy in policy and its concomitant narratives in fostering collective endeavors toward sustainable development. It also amplifies the pivotal interconnections between SDG 7 "Affordable and Clean Energy," SDG 13 "Climate Action," and SDG 16 "Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions." Employing FEUs to evaluate sustainability policies can substantially benefit researchers, policy architects, and public engagement coordinators by highlighting lacunae and limitations within prevailing strategic narratives and proposing potential enhancements to fortify their capacity to motivate collective action.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a novel methodology and design to contribute towards the achievement of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by member states of the United Nations for a better and more sustainable future for all. We particularly focus on achieving SDG 4.7-using education to ensure all learners acquire the knowledge and skills needed to promote sustainable development. We describe the design of a crowdsourced approach to monitor issues at a local level, and then use the insights gained to indicate how learning can be achieved by the entire community. We begin by encouraging local communities to identify issues that they are concerned about, with an assumption that any issue identified will fall within the purview of the 17 SDGs. Each issue is then tagged with a plurality of actions taken to address it. Finally, we tag the positive or negative changes in the issue as perceived by members of the local community. This data is used to broadly indicate quantitative measures of community learning when solving a societal problem, in turn telling us how SDG 4.7 is being achieved. The paper describes the design of a unique, youth-led, technology-based, bottom-up approach, applicable to communities across the globe, which can potentially ensure transgressive learning through participation of and monitoring by the local community leading to sustainable development.

AB  - The rapid urban renewal progress has generated a large amount of construction and demolition (C&D) waste in China. According to the concept of circular economy (CE), producing products with recycled content (PwRC) is an effective solution to achieve sustainable C&D waste management. However, the low market acceptance of PwRC affects stakeholders' purchase intention, which hinders the development of the PwRC industry. In order to clarify the stakeholders' purchase intention and investigate the influencing mechanism of stakeholders' purchase intention, a novel method which combines structural equation modeling (SEM) with a back-propagation neural network (BPNN) is proposed. The method makes full use of the causal analysis ability of SEM and the nonlinear characteristics of BPNN to simulate and to verify the path of product cues, perceived value, and behavioral intention of stakeholders. The results reveal that the brand and materials of PwRC can affect stakeholders' perceived value, and in turn, affect their purchase intention. Focus on the brand and materials of PwRC will help recycled product manufacturers and governments to promote stakeholders' purchase intention and the development of the C&D waste recycled products market.

AB  - Collaborative information sharing in the maritime logistics supply chain is essential for achieving efficiency, sustainability, and resilience. However, numerous barriers hinder effective information sharing among key stakeholders, including port operators, shipping companies, and trucking firms. This study conducts an empirical analysis involving surveys and interviews with logistics industry experts in South Korea, applying the Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (Fuzzy AHP) to identify and prioritize critical collaborative information-sharing barriers in the maritime logistics supply chain. Through a comprehensive literature review, a range of barriers was identified, and their relevance was validated through structured surveys with industry experts. The application of Fuzzy AHP, which incorporates the inherent uncertainty in human judgment, enabled the identification of the most critical barriers that require urgent resolution. Based on these findings, a robust and actionable framework is proposed to address the identified challenges, integrating insights from expert interviews and the literature. The framework encompasses strategies such as data standardization, advanced data security, enhanced service compatibility, policy and institutional improvements, and stakeholder engagement. By addressing these critical barriers, the proposed framework aims to foster seamless information sharing and collaboration, ultimately enhancing the efficiency and sustainability of the maritime logistics supply chain.

AB  - The robotic mobile fulfillment (RMF) system is a parts-to-picker warehousing system and a sustainable technology used in human-robot collaborative order picking. Storage location assignment (SLA) tactically benefits order-picking efficiency. Most studies focus on the retrieval efficiency of robots to solve SLA problems. To further consider the crucial role played by human pickers in RMF systems, especially in the context that the sustainable performance of human workers should be paid attention to in human-robot collaboration, we solve the SLA problem by aiming to improve human-robot collaborative order-picking efficiency. This study specifically makes decisions on assigning multiple items of various products to the slots of pods in the RMF system, in which human behavioral factors are taken into account. To obtain the solution in one mathematical model, we propose the heuristic algorithm under a two-stage optimization method. The results show that assigning correlated products to pods improves the retrieval efficiency of robots compared to class-based assignment. We also find that assigning items of each product to slots of pods, considering behavioral factors, benefits the operation efficiency of human pickers compared to random assignment. Improving human-robot collaborative order-picking efficiency and increasing the capacity usage of pods benefits sustainable warehousing management.

AB  - Creative social enterprises are increasingly emerging in rural regions, motivated by a desire to take social responsibility through creative approaches. These enterprises integrate entrepreneurial activities with creative social attributes and are sometimes set in rural collaborative workspaces (CWSs) facilitating entrepreneurial activities. Under the frame of entrepreneurial ecosystems (EEs), we argue that CWSs can be seen as brokers, who (1) link resources as liaisons, (2) hold and pass resources as gatekeepers, (3) enhance resource flows as coordinators, and (4) reproduce experiences as representatives. Against this backdrop, this paper presents a case study of two creative social enterprises in a CWS with a cooperative structure in rural Upper Austria by analyzing entrepreneurial biographies about the demand and use of entrepreneurial resources. Through a comparison between before and after the emergence of the CWS, the findings suggest that the EE for creative and social entrepreneurship undergoes two different types of transformation, a radical and a gradual one. The brokerage process of the CWS enhances local resource networks' transformation of EE and brings the transformation in terms of translocal resources and integral EE of enterprises in the CWS. Additionally, the CWS generates social impacts on the local community through social enterprises. This paper contributes to ecosystem literature by introducing an actor-centric perspective and giving new insights into social entrepreneurship and the transformative power of CWSs as brokers.

AB  - Medication waste has a high impact on the healthcare budget and detrimental effects on the environment. Therefore, preventing medication from remaining unused through the pharmaceutical chain forms an interesting approach to achieve sustainable supply and use of medication. This scoping review focusses on how stakeholders involved can prevent the waste of potentially viable medication.
   Manufacturers can contribute to sustainable supply and use of medication by extending medications' shelf-life, choosing the most sustainable storage conditions and adjusting package sizes. The role of distributors involves stock management optimisation and loosening shelf-life policies. In turn, prescribers can commit to rational prescribing practices, including consideration of prescription quantities and prescriptions for shorter durations. Pharmacists can contribute via appropriate stock management, enhancing medication preparation processes, optimising dispensing processes, and redispensing unused medication. Patients' awareness of medication waste must be increased to stimulate conscious medication-ordering and to create willingness for participation in waste-minimising interventions. Finally, health authorities can contribute to sustainability by creating awareness and enforcing waste-minimising measures. Due to the multiple causes of medication waste at all levels of the pharmaceutical supply and use chain, no single intervention is sufficient to overcome the problem of medication waste, thus a joint responsibility of all stakeholders is needed.

AB  - Over the past decade, the proliferation of entrepreneurial ventures and small firms with sustainable business models have pushed the sustainability agenda in the fashion industry. Despite prominent success stories, these companies often encounter significant operative challenges that hinder growth or even cause business failure. This paper adopts a qualitative research design and uses data gathered during 18 expert interviews with entrepreneurs and executive managers of 18 firms from 13 countries to identify and explore the dominant challenges that micro- and small-sized sustainable fashion companies struggle with. The results indicate that communicating with consumers is perceived as surprisingly difficult, especially because sustainable brands need to justify higher prices and explain the added benefits of their products. Second, resource constraints lead to operative friction and overburdening of the decision makers and their small management teams. Third, sustainable sourcing and production processes are economically difficult in an industry that continues to occupy a mass and low-cost logic. Against the background of these insights, a range of managerial recommendations are developed and contextualized in the framework of the Business Model Canvas. This novel approach makes the suggestions which are rooted in the resource-based view actionable and supports sustainable businesses to better manage their operations and achieve growth. For example, collaborative approaches with different stakeholders may mitigate constraints across all three identified problem areas.

AB  - This article discusses the concept and the practice of transdisciplinary research, including how it is conceived and implemented through the cooperation of different actors involved. With transdisciplinarity gaining recognition as an approach to addressing sustainable development challenges, the successful integration of various disciplines and actors in the process of knowledge generation becomes essential. Through the Cooperation and Development Center (CODEV), the Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL) has promoted transdisciplinary research by proposing a space where North-South partnerships integrating academic and non-academic actors enable the expansion of appropriate technologies and innovations adapted to local societal contexts. This study examines five collaborative research projects conducted at the EPFL. By using an analytical framework consisting of design principles for ideal transdisciplinary research, we conducted semi-structured interviews with academic and non-academic members of the research projects to assess the degree of transdisciplinarity. This framework proved to be a useful tool for exploring transdisciplinary dynamics and assessing the effectiveness of joint knowledge generation. We found that the transdisciplinary cooperation involving different actors is not a linear process, as it depends on the social context in which the project is carried out and on the internal and the external organizational structure established for its implementation. We provide recommendations on how transdisciplinarity could be expanded through institutional support and its results could be effectively transferred into science and practice and discuss the implications for further studies in the conclusions.

AB  - Globally, society faces significant problems, from climate crisis to persistent poverty. Education for Sustainable Development offers an approach to achieving a sustainable society. The challenge is creating changemakers with the knowledge, mindset, and competencies to innovate. Teaching sustainability tends to be discipline-specific, taught content-heavy via "spoon-feeding" and neglecting student agency changes. To overcome these challenges, we developed a programme to "teach" innovation for sustainability that combines transformative learning and design thinking as the pedagogy. Classes were anchored by solving a real-world sustainability challenge, facilitating experience transformation into new knowledge. Design Thinking is a transdisciplinary methodology that helps different disciplines collaborate on addressing complex problems. However, there is limited empirical evidence to support the effectiveness of this transformative pedagogy in sustainability education. What is the value of combining Design Thinking and Transformative Learning as a pedagogy in sustainability education? Based on the University College Dublin Innovation Academy's Professional Diploma of Innovation for Sustainability, we address this research question by exploring the impacts of the programme design. Data were collected during and after the programme through students' reflections and observation field notes of teaching sections. Findings show that the programme design supported developing a sustainability mindset, sustainability literacy, and creative confidence. All characteristics support becoming a changemaker.

AB  - Collaborative governance is increasingly demanded in multiple sectors and considered promising to address wicked sustainability challenges. Whether it meets these expectations remains uncertain, particularly as such initiatives take place within a broader landscape of public and private policies and projects. We explore how collaborative governance initiative is shaped by its broader landscape to deliver on its goals. To do so, we provide a framework for analysing governance modes and social interactions in collaborative governance. We use an exploratory case study of the German Partnership for Sustainable Textiles (hereafter: Textiles Partnership). The partnership is a multi-stakeholder, collaborative governance initiative that links to a variety of different initiatives, and highlights barriers and transformation potential both within and outside its boundaries. Based on qualitative interviews, analysis of policy documents and a focus group discussion, we show that the complexity of the landscape field is accompanied by capacity constraints for all actors involved. Such complexity raises questions about whether this governance mode influences actual change on the ground, or diverts energies into navigating and proliferating complexity with low levels of meaningful outcomes. There is a growing call from actors within the partnership towards more state-centred regulation, resulting in a Due Diligence Act in 2021, to regulate corporate action across national borders. The evidence we present shows the need to reconsider the balance between state regulation and collaborative governance arrangements.

AB  - With the acceleration of population growth and urbanization, domestic solid waste has emerged as a critical concern for the sustainable development of cities. China is actively exploring collaborative disposal models to achieve synergistic reductions in both pollutants and greenhouse gases. This study comprehensively assesses the environmental impacts of a domestic solid waste collaborative disposal park from a life cycle perspective, identifies key cooperative factors, and evaluates the overall effects of optimizing these factors. Additionally, a synergistic evaluation model for pollution and carbon reduction has been developed to quantify the degree of synergy across different domestic solid waste disposal patterns. The results indicate that the environmental benefits of domestic solid waste collaborative disposal parks primarily originate from the energy system and slag recycling processes. Conversely, the incineration and flue gas purification systems are major contributors to environmental impact and should be prioritized in environmental management and monitoring. Among the cooperative factors, material factors have the most significant influence and are critical for future optimization. This study demonstrates the environmental benefits of promoting collaborative disposal of domestic solid waste in China from a quantitative perspective, providing valuable data to support decision-makers in further optimizing or implementing such practices. Furthermore, it establishes a reference framework for analyzing other disposal models, contributing to a broader understanding of sustainable waste management.

AB  - Stakeholder awareness of social sustainability issues is growing, but few recognize what motivates companies to implement social sustainability in their supply chain management or return on investment in developing countries, where cultural norms might vary widely. We address this question by broadening stakeholder and institutional perspectives to investigate how customers, sustainability culture, management, and external stakeholders influence companies' acceptance of social sustainability in their supply chains. We collected information on 356 apparel and footwear manufacturers from 5 South Asian countries that sell to customers in Western Europe and North America. Our findings highlight the interdependence of organizational and institutional structures and define the boundaries of GVC governance mechanisms within a social sustainability framework. Our research shows that the success of examining social sustainability interventions applied by leading firms or the effects of collaboration-based global value chains depend on the supplier's local institutional framework. Social sustainability organizational practices influence supplier perceptions and responses to key corporate needs in the supplier's country. We demonstrate that GVC governance models are most conducive to suppliers' social sustainability implementation when contextualized with the local institutional needs for social sustainability in the supplier's country.

AB  - Colleges and universities around the world are increasingly using their campuses as living laboratories for sustainability problem-solving and engagement. "Campus-as-lab" (CAL) projects emphasize experiential learning and campus sustainability through the integration of research and campus operations. By engaging students in CAL work, campuses make themselves more sustainable while contributing to knowledge and research needed to make an impact beyond their borders. The Sustainability Tracking, Assessment, and Rating System (STARS) is an important tool to track work in this rapidly evolving CAL arena. Here, we use data from STARS 2.0 to assess the self-reporting and concentration of CAL efforts in 14 operational and administrative areas across institutions of higher education in North America. We analyzed self-reported STARS reports in 2016 and 2018 and found that there was a 203% increase in institutions self-reporting CAL efforts (2016: n = 171; 2018: n = 347). Most efforts tend to be concentrated in the operational categories linked to the built environment. Socially explicit categories such as Diversity and Affordability, however, show increases in self-reporting. We identify nascent CAL priority areas, including the arts and biodiversity and conservation, as well as significant mis- or over-reporting of CAL efforts. To optimize the utility of STARS as a metric for capturing sustainability problem-solving efforts through CAL activities, process revisions are needed to ensure that institutions of higher education are accurately interpreting and self-reporting CAL work and that the STARS tool adequately captures the changing role that sustainability plays on university campuses in North America and beyond.

AB  - An efficient waste treatment strategy should be cost-effective and, minimize potential impacts on various stakeholders and the environment. This study proposes a decision framework that can model the stakeholder's conflicting priorities over the sustainability criteria, when selecting a municipal solid waste treatment option. The proposed framework compares life cycle sustainability impacts of selected options and develops a weighing scheme for combining impacts based on stakeholders' preferences. It then uses game theory to help the stakeholders fairly share the costs and benefits, and guides the stakeholders to reach an agreement on a mutually sustainable and pragmatic solution. In this study, the application of the framework to select a waste-to-energy technology for Vancouver, Canada is demonstrated. The case study discusses the prospect of producing refuse-derived fuel by cement industry and the municipality. Results show that the cement industry and the municipality may mutually benefit from the refuse derived fuel, if the industry pays a tipping fee of $0.077-0.96 per kg waste to access the required amount of solid waste from the municipality. The outcome of the framework can help in the approval and application of an overall sustainable option by both stakeholders and in making the negotiation more efficient and timely.

AB  - This conceptual paper discusses 'unseen observation' as an alternative model of classroom observation to support teachers' professional learning. The paper starts with a critical synopsis of how observation has been appropriated principally as a performance management tool for monitoring teacher effectiveness in the UK. It argues that the overreliance on assessment-based models has led to the hegemony of observation as a performative tool and its subsequent dilution as a catalyst for professional learning to develop teachers' pedagogic thinking and practice. As a counter narrative, this paper proposes an alternative, peer-based model, unseen observation, which reconceptualises and reconfigures observation for professional learning by prioritising collegial meaning-making and reflexive dialogue. Drawing on the concept of intersubjectivity to theorise unseen observation, the principles, purpose and practical application of this model are discussed, along with its benefits and challenges. The paper argues that unseen observation offers a structured approach for stimulating and channelling opportunities for teachers to engage in honest introspection, participatory sensemaking and reflexive dialogue of their practice. Meaningful and sustainable improvements in professional learning are arguably more likely to flourish by creating such opportunities, though further research is needed to investigate the application and impact of unseen observation as a model.

AB  - Despite increasing business interest in sustainability in general and in sustainable supply chain management (SSCM), the ability to increase suppliers' ecological and social performance is generally insufficient for many companies. In this study, we outline an implementation process model for sustainable supply chain management. We do so by synthesizing insights from a review of the sustainable supply chain management and organizational learning literature and a case study with a company aspiring to become a global leader in sustainable lighting. By combining these insights, we find that successful implementation of sustainable supply chain management requires sustainability to be anchored in a company's vision and integrated into all functions. We also argue that organizational learning, especially learning with external stakeholders such as suppliers, an operational definition of socioecological sustainability among stakeholders, and procedural support for the cocreation of strategic plans for change are vital for achieving a truly sustainable supply chain. This definition and cocreation allow for attention to be directed toward strategic ecological and social practices, along with the joint handling of tradeoffs and economic considerations among stakeholders. As we build a foundation for an SSCM implementation process model, we use a science-based framework for strategic sustainable development. We call for more action-based research to uncover the complex nature of sustainable supply chain management, as there are unique challenges and dynamic relationships in every supply chain.

AB  - Assessing street walkability is a critical agenda in urban planning and multidisciplinary research, as it facilitates public health, community cohesion, and urban sustainability. Existing evaluation systems primarily focus on objective measurements, often neglecting subjective assessments and the diverse walking needs influenced by different urban spatial elements. This study addresses these gaps by constructing a comprehensive evaluation framework that integrates both subjective and objective dimensions, combining three neighbourhood indicators: Macro-Scale Index, Micro-Scale Index, and Street Walking Preferences Index. A normalization weighting method synthesizes these indicators into a comprehensive index. We applied this framework to assess the street environment within Beijing's Fifth Ring Road. The empirical results demonstrate that: (1) The framework reliably reflects the distribution of walkability. (2) The three indicators show both similarities and differences, underscoring the need to consider the distinct roles of community and street-level elements and the interaction between subjective and objective dimensions. (3) In high-density cities with ring-road development patterns, the Macro-Scale Index closely aligns with the Comprehensive Index, demonstrating its accuracy in reflecting walkability. The proposed framework and findings offer new insights for street walkability research and theoretical support for developing more inclusive, sustainable and walkable cities.

AB  - Background Whole-of-community interventions hold promise in addressing childhood obesity. The COMPACT Stakeholder-driven Community Diffusion theory posits that stakeholders' knowledge of childhood obesity prevention efforts and engagement with the issue contribute to successful intervention implementation. Building on completed formative research and pilot testing, we describe the validation and refinement of knowledge and engagement measures. Methods We assessed content validity using a modified Delphi process with science (n=18) and practice-based (n=16) experts. Next, we refined the survey based on input from science- and practice-based experts, cognitive response testing, and item analysis of extant survey data. Field testing of the refined survey involved community stakeholders in Greenville County, South Carolina (n=50), East Boston, Massachusetts (n=30), and Tucson, Arizona (n=84) between 2019 and 2020. Construct validity was assessed with confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Two-week test-retest reliability was assessed among a subsample of 14 paired respondents in South Carolina. Results Experts rated existing knowledge domains (intervention factors, roles, sustainability, problem, resources) and engagement domains (dialogue/mutual learning, flexibility, influence/power, leadership/stewardship, trust) highly for their importance in addressing childhood obesity. Expert input resulted in 11 new knowledge items and 7 new engagement items that mapped onto existing domains. Correspondingly, two domain names were modified: implementation/sustainability and trust/trustworthiness. We also eliminated 8 extant items (4 knowledge and 4 engagement) and adapted item language for comprehension and consistency. Further modifications based on CFA results and item analyses resulted in 23 knowledge items across four domains (roles and resources merged) and 23 engagement items across five domains. Modified knowledge and engagement scales had adequate fit and strong item factor loadings (most >0.7 and all >0.5). Knowledge (alpha=0.86-0.87) and engagement (alpha=0.75-0.90) subscales had high internal scale consistency. Knowledge intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) for test-retest agreement of subscale scores ranged from 0.50 for intervention factors to 0.86 for roles/resources. For engagement subscale scores, ICCs ranged from 0.70 for trust/trustworthiness to 0.96 for leadership/stewardship. Conclusions Findings from this multi-method survey development process increase our confidence of the knowledge and engagement measures' content validity, construct validity, and reliability.

AB  - There is increasing legislative and public pressure for the design and build of road infrastructure schemes to achieve better sustainability performance. Roadside noise barriers (RNBs) form a major part of the growing road infrastructure system in mitigating undesirable road noise to impacted communities. However, the relative sustainability of common RNBs is little understood in the research and industry literature. This makes it difficult for stakeholders to make informed decisions with regards to the sustainable design and procurement of RNBs. This paper presents nowel research carried out to assess and rank the relative sustainability of 13 RNB types using three multi criteria analysis (MCA) techniques, i.e. Simple Additive Weighting (SAW), Preference Ranking Organisation MeTHod for Enrichment Evaluations (PROMETHEE), and Elimination et Choice Translating Reality (ELECTRE III). The paper concludes that the presented sustainability rankings of the main RNB types from least sustainable to most sustainable will support the relevant stakeholders, involved in the planning, design, and procurement stages, to evaluate the sustainability of RNB options as either part of a large highways scheme or standalone project. The presented results will save significant analysis time and costs in cases whereby it is unfeasible to conduct MCAs. The presented sustainability asssessment methodology may also provide the basis for an industry sustainability certification sceheme and in turn support advancing the sustainability transport agenda.

AB  - Many wetlands have experienced rapid degradation that is due to unstainable development practices globally. Oftentimes, uncoordinated economic development plans in wetlands and surrounding areas have affected the ecological functions of these sensitive ecosystems. This study examined Setiu Wetland, a wetland with diverse ecosystems on the east coast of Peninsular Malaysia. The main objective of this study was to analyse the potential of marine spatial planning (MSP) to be adopted there. MSP is an integrated coastal zone management tool to govern conflicting uses of an area considering environmental sustainably. Like other coastal zone managements adopted in Southeast Asia, MSP requires participation and awareness of the local community to ensure sustainable development targets are achieved. This paper addresses the local community's awareness of the ecosystem importance of Setiu Wetland and the socio-economic activities in the area. The study employed a quantitative approach using a survey method to examine, in particular, the local community's awareness of the oyster habitat that has a direct impact on the Setiu Wetland ecosystems. The research findings indicate that awareness of the importance of oyster habitats to the wetland ecosystems is high among the local community. The community strongly supports the idea of protecting and preserving the wetland to ensure the healthy functioning of ecosystems.

AB  - Despite the growth of urban food policies across the globe, a key challenge remains around measuring the impact of these initiatives in building more sustainable and just cities. The literature identifies as the main barriers to progress food system assessments the lack of clear definitions of sustainability, insufficient data, the low applicability of global conceptualisations to local conditions and vice versa and low levels of actor involvement. We aim to address these gaps by co-developing a sustainability assessment framework to evaluate food systems performance in UK cities. The framework emerging from this collaborative process overcomes key limitations of previous exercises by providing a place-based and participative definition of sustainability aligned with global conceptualisations, building on the experiences and needs of a wide range of practitioners and taking a holistic but non-prescriptive approach to understanding food system outcomes. However, its application to the city of Cardiff reveals new challenges, mostly regarding the need to incorporate underrepresented stakeholders as well as account for multiscalar food system interdependencies and their positive but also negative impacts. Results show the need to embed critical perspectives in sustainable food assessments that actively expand their transformative capacity by developing further inclusive, participatory, place-based and whole-systems approaches.

AB  - High levels of violence and insecurity are highly detrimental for societies. United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 16 is advocating for peaceful, accountable and inclusive institutions as one powerful channel to foster global development. Investing in health and health policies can potentially contribute achieving these objectives. After providing a conceptual framework, this article reviews the existing literature on the evidence of the role of health and health systems in promoting social capital and trust, political engagement and participation, and peace that closely relate to the objectives of Sustainable Development Goal 16. We provide evidence of a systematically positive impact of better physical and mental health on social capital, and on political participation, both contributing to the sustainability of inclusive democratic institutions. We also document that health and health systems can help supporting peace, both via the reduction of social inequality and grievances, and by reducing the disruptive effects of epidemic shocks. Overall, the study provides evidence that health and health systems can generate co -benefits outside the health domain by promoting social capital, political participation and peace.

AB  - There are practical challenges for the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations 2030 Agenda. In a number of policies, social economy (SE) entities can play a central role in terms of achieving their targets. One possible method of implementing several of the SDGs is through the promotion of such entities, as these have already proved to be a successful method for achieving different objectives related to a better quality of life and sustainability (i.e., the creation of jobs, reducing inequality, local investment, responsible social practices, or environmental protection). However, it is not immediately obvious that these entities can also help implement SDG 14, which aims to "conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development." The purpose of this paper is to empower sustainable small-scale fishing (SSF) through SE policies by means of a transdisciplinary approach. SSF is a sector that tends to be firmly rooted in local communities, with its traditions and values coinciding with those of the SE. Thus, SE entities can be an important asset to "Provide access for small-scale artisanal fishers to marine resources and markets." Therefore, different public policies in the area of SSF are proposed here in order to ensure they are implemented correctly.

AB  - Purpose The authors develop a methodology to select appropriate sustainable supply chain indicators (SSCIs) to measure Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in the global supply chain. Design/methodology/approach SSCIs are identified by reviewing the extant literature and topic modeling. Further, they are evaluated based on existing SDGs and ranked using the fuzzy technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) method. Notably, the evaluation of indicators is a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) process within a fuzzy environment. The methodology has been explained using a case study from the automobile industry. Findings The case study identifies appropriate SSCIs and differentiates them among peer suppliers for gaining a competitive advantage. The results reveal that top-ranked sustainability indicators include the management of natural resources, energy, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and social investment. Practical implications The study outcome will enable suppliers, specialists and decision makers to understand the criteria that improve supply chain sustainability in the automobile industry. The analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of the competitive package of indicators for gaining strategic advantage. This proactive sustainability indicator selection promotes and enhances sustainability reporting while fulfilling regulatory requirements and increasing collaboration potential with trustworthy downstream partners. This study sets the stage for further research in SSCIs' competitive strategy in the automobile industry along with its supply chains. Originality/value This study is unique as it provides a framework for determining relevant SSCIs, which can be distinguished from peer suppliers, while also matching economic, environmental and social metrics to achieve a competitive advantage.

AB  - Future climate changes and the resulting modifications in anthropogenic activities will alter the interactions between rivers and groundwater. The quantification of these hydraulic interactions is absolutely necessary for achieving sustainable water use and requires accurate analytical methodologies. This report proposes an interdisciplinary approach to the quantitative and qualitative characterization of hydraulic interactions between rivers and shallow aquifers, wherein it outlines the advantages of coupling groundwater modeling with biological markers. As a first step, we built independent diagnostic maps of hydrological exchanges at the sector scale on the basis of hydrogeological modeling and biological indicators. In a second step, these maps were compared to provide a quantitative and qualitative understanding of exchanges between groundwater and surface water. This comparison significantly improved the calibration of groundwater models through a better assessment of boundary zones. Our approach enabled us to identify the conditions under which it could be possible to use biological indicators instead of a large set of piezometric measures. The integration of such combined tools in a future decision support system will assist governmental authorities in proposing appropriate long-term water policies for the preservation of groundwater resources, such as for supplying potable water and/or mitigating pollution risks.

AB  - Integration and monitoring are pressing conceptual and methodological challenges in social-ecological systems (SES) research. This paper follows a social learning process, called participatory self-observation, piloted by a group of action-researchers to improve SES integration and monitoring, using the Tsitsa River Catchment in South Africa as a case study. The participatory self-observation process reflected on lessons to enhance integration and integrated monitoring of biophysical, social, and social-ecological data in SES projects; for adaptive planning and management. Three focal points emerged for improving the challenges of SES integration: the need for participatory people-based processes, the importance of applied praxis tasks to catalyze meaningful integration, and the need for transdisciplinary teams to value non-biophysical research. Five focal areas emerged as major challenges for SES monitoring: the integration of qualitative and quantitative data, data overload, the scale of SES monitoring, the need to center SES monitoring around learning, and good working relationships to enable data flow. Recommendations to further develop integrated monitoring and management of SESs include (i) using people-based approaches that focus on applied work which includes rigorous collection of quantitative, biophysical data, (ii) identifying essential data needs through an essential variable approach, and (iii) combining quantitative monitoring with participatory people-based processes.

AB  - The introduction of technical solutions and the phasing out of unsustainable technologies in Elverum, a small town in the middle of the Norwegian forest, is the starting point for this discussion about homelife and why it can be resistant to change. Sustainable ambitions, goals, and solutions are inspired by the challenges faced by urban neighborhoods, but rural communities are also dealing with the sustainable transition and require opportunities for change that are relevant within their particular context. This article takes an emic insider view of how innovative, and potentially more sustainable technology, affects homelife by considering four main themes: choosing where to live; relationships with cars; leisure activities; and how Ydalir-a zero-emission neighborhood being planned in Elverum-is understood within this context. Rather than smoothing over variations in needs and preferences inside and outside urban and rural contexts, engaging with differences helps to avoid misunderstandings and disappointments. The goal is to encourage a co-production of meaning when approaching the challenge of achieving goals for sustainable futures. Furthermore, associations between homelife and social sustainability offer a site where the sustainable practice is strong. Many rural communities already possess qualities, such as equity, social engagement, inclusion, social interaction, safety, and security. We propose that starting with social sustainability, rather than technical innovation, has the potential to encourage sustainable practices in rural communities, thereby increasing the appropriation and domestication of sustainable ambitions outside of urban contexts.

AB  - Due to the fragility of forest ecosystems, developing forest recreational resources must consider sustainable ecological, economic, and social development, and reduce impacts from recreational activities. Diverse forests with different biodiversity could promote forest ecosystem services and resistance to the pressure of tourism development. Under such circumstance, it is important to ensure that the travel and tourism industry develops under the principle of sustainable management and assists ecosystem conservation. Forest ecosystem services (FES) have received increasing attention. Especially, the amenity value provided by FES is beneficial for enhancing human health, and has gained popularity. Huisun National Forest Park (HNFP) has the greatest natural forests in Taiwan, and tourists visit the HNFP for the well-preserved environment, abundance of green space, cleanliness, beautiful scenery, and quietness. This study assessed the amenity value of the Huisun National Forest Park (HNFP) by adopting the payment card method via face-to-face survey data of 223 respondents. The annual amenity value of the HNFP per person is NT$2884 in winter and NT$2905 in summer. The total annual amenity value of the HNFP is NT$473,978,430-474,755,774. The results showed that gender, age, education level, monthly income, place of residence, participation in environmental groups, frequency of visiting the HNFP, and stay period significantly influence willingness to pay (WTP). This study concludes that an ecologically sustainable forest with ecosystem services could provide multiple benefits to different stakeholders.

AB  - BackgroundEvidence-informed Decision-making in Nutrition and Health (EVIDENT) is an international partnership that seeks to identify information needs in nutrition and health in Africa and build local capacity in knowledge management to help translate the best available evidence into context-appropriate recommendations aligned to the priorities of decision-makers. This study evaluates the extent to which EVIDENT achieved its intended activities, documents the lessons learned and draws on these lessons learned to inform future activities of EVIDENT, as well as in evidence-informed decision-making (EIDM) in nutrition overall.MethodsPurposive and snowball sampling were used to identify participants that were either directly or indirectly involved with EVIDENT. An analytical framework of five key elements was developed to guide data collection from EVIDENT's documentation, in-depth interviews (n=20), online surveys (n=26) and a participatory discussion. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and coded in NVivo 11, using deductive thematic content analysis and a phenomenological approach. Online surveys were analysed using Stata 14. Data were triangulated to address both objectives under each element of the analytical framework.ResultsEVIDENT succeeded in establishing a collaborative partnership, within which it delivered four short courses in EIDM. This capacity complemented case study activities in four partner African countries where EIDM processes were implemented and assessed. Identified barriers to these processes included little experience in EIDM, difficulties in engaging stakeholders, challenging local environments (e.g. donor influence, bureaucracy, inaccessibility to scientific research, poor internet connectivity), and limited time and funding. However, EVIDENT activities were driven by a local need for EIDM, a sheer interest and commitment to the cause, and the opportunity for the Global North and South to work together and build relationships. Future activities of EVIDENT, and EIDM in nutrition overall, should focus on sustained capacity-building in EIDM processes, leadership and functional skills across the Global South, investment in stakeholder engagement, context-specific EIDM, enhanced communication and linking, and strengthening relationships with existing stakeholder organisations.ConclusionsIn its first 3 years, EVIDENT developed and strengthened partnership, capacity and visibility on EIDM in Africa. Innovative and long-term capacity-building, dedicated leadership, further stakeholder engagement and sustainable financing, are needed for future activities of EVIDENT and EIDM in nutrition.

AB  - Recently, the novel concept of the circular supply chain (CSC) has gained substantial attention amongst researchers across the globe. It is due to the issues of unsustainability in supply chain operation of manufacturing industry. CSC amalgamates the circular economy (CE) into the supply chain of manufacturing organizations. Business organizations can achieve several sustainable development goals by adopting CSC as an innovative strategy. However, limited attention has been given to its implementation in emerging economies. Thus, this research aim is to identify and analyze the essential CE practices that help to accomplish the several sustainable development goals (SDGs) of CSC management. This research presents an integrated framework of Pythagorean fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (PF-AHP) and Pythagorean fuzzy combinative distance-based assessment (PFCODAS) techniques. PF-AHP is employed to determine the relative importance of CE practices, whereas PFCODAS method ranks the SDGs derived due to the adoption of CE practices. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated with the help of an Indian manufacturing organization. The finding of this research reveals that practices based on 'government', 'management', and 'economy' initiatives play a significant role and contribute 50 % of its influence on the effective CSC adoption, whereas, 'mitigate waste and enhance environmental sustainability', is identified as the most critical SDG realized due to adoption of CE practices. Sensitivity analysis is conducted to check the robustness of proposed methods. This research provides the systematic, accurate, and valuable decision support tools to practitioners to execute the CE practices efficiently for achieving the various sustainability goals.

AB  - Plural valuation is about eliciting the diverse values of nature articulated by different stakeholders in order to inform decision making and thus achieve more equitable and sustainable outcomes. We explore what approaches align with plural valuation on the ground, as well as how different social-ecological contexts play a role in translating plural valuation into decisions and outcomes. Based on a co-constructed analytical approach relying on empirical information from ten cases from the Global South, we find that plural valuation contributes to equitable and sustainable outcomes if the valuation process: 1) is based on participatory value elicitation approaches; 2) is framed with a clear action-oriented purpose; 3) provides space for marginalized stakeholders to articulate their values in ways that can be included in decisions; 4) is used as a tool to identify and help reconcile different cognitive models about human-nature relations; and 5) fosters open communication and collaboration among stakeholders. We also find that power asymmetries can hinder plural valuation. As interest and support for undertaking plural valuation grows, a deeper understanding is needed regarding how it can be adapted to different purposes, approaches, and social-ecological contexts in order to contribute to social equity and sustainability.

AB  - While the specialisation of science is important for understanding specific systems, the isolation of scientific schools in their disciplinary silos makes it harder to understand the interactions within and between systems and limits the wisdom about the whole systems' sustainability. Science integration and its practical implementation is a key factor of success for sustainable development. The aim of this paper is to present a participatory geospatial toolkit developed during the BONUS MARES project that enables science integration and knowledge transfer informing SDGs based governance and decision making. This was realized through the Eco-GAME (Governance Assessment Matrix Exercise) framework, trans-disciplinary social learning for the meta-evaluation of existing knowledge about human-nature systems interaction-manifested through ecosystem services. The Eco-GAME was applied to a participatory geospatial toolkit that translates complex ecological knowledge on ecosystems, ecosystem functions, and services produced into more usable forms to inform evidence-based decision-making in pursuit of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This is the first attempt, in the context of geospatial applications, to support dynamic interaction, trans-disciplinary social-learning, and multi-dimensional appreciation of ecosystem services for integrating ecological, non-economic and economic knowledge and methods. The toolkit is being implemented in the MAREA project.

AB  - Experimentation is an important capability in the transition to a sustainable business. The aim of business experimentation is to learn and improve business model innovation activities with limited risks and resources through continuous and collective learning with stakeholders. Through action research we worked with eight case companies on a pathway to becoming a sustainable business. We focused on 'circular economy' as a driver for sustainability. The process and role of business model experimentation were analysed. A circular business experimentation framework was developed and applied. We found that 1) experimentation creates internal and external engagement to start business sustainability transitions 2) experiments can help test assumptions in every building block of the business model 3) collaboration with external partners can ease experimentation, and 4) experimentation processes are iterative and require regular learning and sustainability checks. Further research is necessary to analyse how sustainability targets can be integrated into the experimentation process.

AB  - As an essential part of a city, community is significant to the sustainable development of the city. At present, research on community sustainability assessment systems is relatively scarce. The existing community sustainability assessment systems often lack integrated consideration of community sustainability. For example, these systems especially place emphasis on the ecological and environmental aspects, but the economic and social aspects of sustainability are partially ignored. In order to comprehensively evaluate the sustainability of a community, this paper draws on the "participatory philosophy" and constructs an integrated assessment indicator system that includes five dimensions: environment; economy; society; institution; and culture. On this basis, a new hybrid evaluation method based on analytical hierarchy process (AHP)-entropy weight and the cloud model is proposed to evaluate community sustainability. This method combines AHP and the entropy weight method to determine index weight, thus making full use of their respective advantages. At the same time, it makes use of the superiority of the cloud model to transform qualitative remarks into quantitative representations and to reflect fuzziness and randomness. To verify the feasibility of this method, a case study is carried out on the "Minxinjiayuan" public rental housing community in Chongqing, China. The results show that the overall sustainability of the community lies between the "middle" and "good" level, and closer to the "middle" level. The level of the economic and social sustainability is higher than that of the environmental, institutional and cultural sustainability.

AB  - In learning networks for sustainable development, partnerships of actors aim at sustainable, innovative solutions through knowledge sharing or collaborative knowledge development. Joint learning in these networks takes place through a variety of communicative interactions with learning outcomes at the individual level as well as the group level. According to learning technologists there is great potential in the application of social 'Web 2.0' software to support the interactions in learning networks, resulting in more effective 'learning networks 2.0'. This article presents a first exploration of the potential of social network software to support learning networks for sustainable development. A design-based approach to this novel area of study was followed, with the aim to identify opportunities, constraints and challenges for further research and development. The approach comprised of the development of a functional and technical design of a social network platform in constant interaction with prospective users and testing of a prototype in two small-scale, but real-life pilots. The results indicate that supporting learning for sustainable development with social network software is technically feasible and can be functionally effective. However, it appears that designers of social software support for such learning networks are also faced with fundamental tensions, which concern the degree of mixing private and professional life, learning networks and social networks, face-to-face and virtual interactions, top down and bottom up control, hierarchical and emergent structure. To deal with these tensions, we recommend to design dedicated, tailor-made social software-based platforms for specific learning networks, with a varying and flexible degree of social network features, depending on the needs and preferences of the users and how these evolve in time.

AB  - Currently, Metropolitans throughout the globe are confronting crucial obstacles to accomplishing water management sustainability, encompassing climate change, explosive urbanization, and swelling populations. This study proposes a framework to evaluate the sustainability of urban water management (UWM), underscoring the significance of expert engagement in identifying appropriate indicators. The study adopts a novel two-step procedure for screening over 300 candidate indicators. A two-stage procedure was followed initially, underpinned by SMART criteria. In the second stage, 24 fit-to-purpose indicators were selected through the fuzzy Delphi method. The framework is subsequently finalized by categorizing the final indicators into seven categories, namely "Water Security," "Water Quality," "Drinking Water," Sanitation and Reuse, "Financial Management," "Governance," and "Risk and Disaster Management," thus facilitating better understanding and linking of UWM practices among diverse stakeholders. The paper demonstrates its application in Mashhad City as a real case. The rapid adoption of the proposed framework in Iran underscores its efficacy in facilitating stakeholders to cultivate collective commitment. This indicator-based framework can assist in identifying essential sustainability trade-offs. In addition, it can also be a practical approach for recognizing water-related priorities to achieve urban water management sustainability. The suggested framework can inspire further expansion of indicator-based frameworks for UWM.

AB  - The surging demand for electricity, propelled by the widespread adoption of intelligent grids and heightened consumer interaction with electricity demand and pricing, underscores the imperative for precise prognostication of optimal power plant utilization. To confront this challenge, a dataset centered on issue-centric power plans is meticulously crafted. This dataset encapsulates pivotal facets indispensable for attaining sustainable power generation, including meager gas emissions, installation cost, low maintenance cost, elevated power generation, and copious resource availability. The selection of an optimal power plant entails a multifaceted decision-making process, demanding a systematic approach. Our research advocates the amalgamation of multiple-criteria decision-making (MCDM) models with self-organizing maps to gauge the efficacy of diverse sustainable energy systems. The examination discerns solar energy as the preeminent MCDM criterion, securing the apex position with a score of 83.4%, attributable to its ample resource availability, considerable energy generation, nil greenhouse gas emissions, and commendable efficiency. Wind and hydroelectric power closely trail, registering scores of 75.3% and 74.5%, respectively, along with other energy sources. The analysis underscores the supremacy of the renewable energy sources, particularly solar and wind, in fulfilling sustainability objectives and scrutinizing factors such as cost, resource availability, and the environmental impact. The proposed methodology empowers stakeholders to make judicious decisions, accentuating facets that are required for more sustainable and resilient power infrastructure.

AB  - Conservation justice, a concept analogous to environmental justice, suggests that local communities are entitled to receive fair treatment and meaningful involvement in the development and implementation of conservation policy. In this study, of an urban conservation project in Cape Town, South Africa, we contribute to the ongoing conversation about the importance of community-based conservation approaches. Conservationists must work to plan and implement projects in ways that are not only acceptable to stakeholders, but inspire local community involvement in achieving conservation goals. Given its location in the impoverished Cape Flats region of metropolitan Cape Town and its unique ecological and conservation value, the Macassar Dunes Conservation Area warrants a conservation justice approach. We conducted semi-structured interviews with members of interested and affected communities, then analyzed stakeholder perspectives on biodiversity protection, fencing, and informal housing. The results suggest that despite disparity among groups in needs and perspectives, conservation projects have potential to deliver tangible benefits to all stakeholder groups. A belief in conservation is universal across stakeholder lines, but contrasting needs and perspectives of the studied groups lead to conflicting views on important issues of implementation. An understanding of different stakeholder groups' specific needs and interests is therefore essential for successful implementation of sustainable urban conservation projects. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Larger ports routinely deploy environmental management tools but systematic sustainability management in smaller ports is rare. Accordingly, this paper assesses the sustainability needs of smaller ports in Cornwall and Devon, a case-study, and proposes a systematic method for identifying and managing them. The development and deployment of a Port Sustainability Management System for smaller ports in an environmentally sensitive but economically peripheral UK area is discussed. In-depth collaboration with Harbour Masters to identify sustainability management practice revealed few applications of the theoretical elements of triple bottom line accounting. Rather, semi-structured interviews unearthed the essential elements of port management and facilitated mapping of the forces which underpin port sustainability practices. A constructivist grounded theory approach identified emerging concepts, common patterns and sustainability themes, which were synthesised into a Sustainability Management System based on 11 indicators of knowledge criteria and a self-scoring mechanism. Adopters reported a more proactive stance towards sustainability and safeguarding of local communities, improved understanding, and more effective discourse with stakeholders. Benefits spanned port improvements; awareness of progress, performance, strengths and weaknesses; enhanced communication and reporting; and improved thought processes. Almost all reacted positively and identified multiple benefits, equating to two new jobs in each port. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose - The sustainability of the global food system hinges on its environmental resiliency and safety, including the health and well-being of its labor force. Single disciplinary courses in liberal arts or science often fail to highlight the overlap between environmental and social vulnerabilities that lead to food insecurity and diminish the sustainability of food systems. This paper aims to present the design and delivery of a successfully co-taught, interdisciplinary module on agricultural labor and sustainable food systems as a case study.
   Design/methodology/approach - The authors designed a co-taught module in which they joined each other's respective history and science class sessions at the undergraduate business college where they teach. Innovating the cross-disciplinary content of food security, immigration status, labor exploitation and pesticide exposure, they approached sustainability from the disciplinary perspectives of labor history and environmental science to show how these elements had both unique and overlapping impacts across food systems levels. Comparisons between pre- and post-module survey responses, alongside assessments of a co-authored exam question, measured the effectiveness of this module is changing students' perspectives as food consumers and as citizens.
   Findings - This module altered students' understanding and perspectives around issues of food systems sustainability. Assessments indicated that students increased their awareness of agricultural workers at the front end of the food system, during production; students also gained awareness beyond consumption as they came to see the connections between workforce invisibility and ecosystem degradation.
   Originality/value - These insights are valuable to educators at all institutional levels who seek to collaborate on sustainability initiatives and teaching, both in the singular, robust modules and in building modules that will lead to the development of entire courses focused on sustainability. The module described here builds on previous demonstrations of the value, significance and effectiveness of cross-disciplinary collaborations; it pioneers the use of the food system as the link between social and environmental sustainability education.

AB  - The product-service system (PSS) is a strategic design approach proposed to address sustainability in socio-economic systems amidst rapid industrialization and transition. Evaluating the concept design of a PSS is a crucial and initial step prior to implementation. This study presents an innovative framework for evaluating concept designs of sustainable PSS based on a well-defined evaluation index system via integrating quality function deployment (QFD) and the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) while accommodating extended basic uncertain linguistic information (EBULI). Specifically, a QFD-based framework is first developed to identify the requirements of various stakeholders and then to establish the multi-dimensional criteria for evaluating sustainable PSS. Then, a House of Quality-based relationship matrix is introduced to determine the weights of criteria more accurately. Further, an adaptive consensus-reaching process method based on an expert weighting optimization model is proposed to ensure a collective outputs recognized by multiple involved stakeholders. Finally, an improved EBULI-based TOPSIS method is presented to determine the priority ranking of alternative sustainable PSS concepts. A case study on a car-sharing PSS project demonstrates the viability and effectiveness of the proposed QFD-TOPSIS integrated approach under EBULI settings. The alternative PSS concept design, which demonstrates relatively good performance in criteria of high importance, is selected as the most suitable option. Moreover, relevant comparative and sensitivity analyses reveal that the proposed approach exhibits superiorities in appropriate criteria elicitation, accurate weights determination, and high consensus ranking outputs.

AB  - Ghost gear has become a significant environmental and economic challenge affecting oceans worldwide. Pre-venting and eliminating ghost gear is essential for achieving sustainable development goals (SDGs), and part-nerships between universities and multi-stakeholders are considered feasible solutions. This case study illuminates the implementation of the Partnerships for Ghost Gear Cleanups & Education Project (PGGCEP) conducted by the National Kaohsiung University of Science and Technology (NKUST) in the Penghu Islands of Taiwan, which involves engagement with local stakeholders to prevent and remediate ghost gear in Penghu seas, providing insights into coastal partnerships building to promote ocean sustainability. The conceptual schemes of PGGCEP include education projects, marine citizenship practices, and awareness campaigns. The outcomes of PGGCEP were analyzed under the framework of SDGs. The results showed that PGGCEP not only successfully supported SDG 14 life below water through the achievement of SDG17 partnerships for the goals, and it also contributed to other SDGs, including SDG 4 quality education, SDG 5 gender equality, SDG 8 decent work and economic growth, and SDG 10 reduced inequalities. Future directions for PGGCEP were subsequently provided to refine the project. Based on the findings, this study proposed a framework of university-driven coastal part-nerships to address ghost gear pollution. This 4-phase framework highlights the pivotal role played by univer-sities as facilitators of collaborative efforts that involve a broad spectrum of stakeholders for enhancing ocean sustainability.

AB  - Protected areas are complex social-ecological systems, hence their management should be guided by engagement and co-learning with diverse stakeholders. The challenge of effective stakeholder participation has generated a body of literature on the design and facilitation of coproduction processes. In this study, we used this literature to develop a principle-based framework for assessing coproduction. We then applied this framework to evaluate how well "adaptive planning" (a sub-process of adaptive management used for visioning and objective setting with stakeholders), as applied to the Garden Route National Park in South Africa, aligned with the ideals of coproduction. Our analysis revealed shortcomings in the adaptive planning process, which could be improved through broadening the agenda beyond the mandate and control of national parks, empowering collective agency among a wider stakeholder network, and embedding co-learning with stakeholders as an ongoing journey. A significant finding was that adaptive management does not align well with the ideals of coproduction, which may be better supported by an adaptive co-management approach. The latter is particularly necessary in complex national parks that are diverse in terms of both ecosystems and stakeholders, and where governance may be contested.

AB  - Building the adaptive capacity of interlinked social and ecological systems is assumed to improve implementation of sustainable forest management (SFM) policies. One mechanism is collaborative learning by continuous evaluation, communication, and transdisciplinary knowledge production. The Model Forest (MF) concept, developed in Canada, is intended to encourage all dimensions of sustainable development through collaboration among stakeholders of forest resources in a geographical area. Because the MF approach encompasses both social and ecological systems, it can be seen as a process aimed at improving adaptive capacity to deal with uncertainty and change. We analyzed multi-stakeholder approaches used in four MF initiatives representing social-ecological systems with different governance legacies and economic histories in the northwest of the Russian Federation (Komi MF and Pskov MF) and in Sweden (Vilhelmina MF and the Foundation Safsen Forests in the Bergslagen region). To describe the motivations behind development of the initiative and the governance systems, we used qualitative open-ended interviews and analyzed reports and official documents. The initial driving forces for establishing new local governance arrangements were different in all four cases. All MFs were characterized by multilevel and multi-sector collaboration. However, the distribution of power among stakeholders ranged from clearly top down in the Russian Federation to largely bottom up in Sweden. All MF initiatives shared three main challenges: (a) to develop governance arrangements that include representative actors and stakeholders, (b) to combine top-down and bottom-up approaches to governance, and (c) to coordinate different sectors' modes of landscape governance. We conclude that, in principle, the MF concept is a promising approach to multi-stakeholder collaboration. However, to understand the local and regional dimensions of sustainability, and the level of adaptability of such multi-stakeholder collaboration initiatives, empirical studies of outcomes are needed. To assess the adaptive capacity, the states and trends of economic, ecological, social, and cultural dimensions in actual landscapes need to be linked to how the multistakeholder collaboration develops and performs over the long term.

AB  - The evaluation of sustainable tourism strategies promoted by National Parks (NP) related stakeholders is a key concern for NP managers. To help them in their strategic evaluation procedures, in this paper we propose a methodology based on the Analytic Network Process and a Delphi-type judgment-ensuring procedure. The approach aims at involving stakeholders in a participatory and consensus-building process.
   The methodology was applied to Los Rogues NP in Venezuela. The problem included three sustainable tourism strategies defined by the stakeholders: eco-efficient resorts, eco-friendly leisure activities and ecological transportation systems. Representatives of eight stakeholders participated in the methodology. 13 sustainability criteria were selected.
   Results provide some important insights into the overall philosophy and underlying participants' conception of what sustainable development of Los Rogues NP means. This conception is broadly shared by stakeholders as they coincided in the weights of most of the criteria, which were assigned individually through the questionnaire. It is particularly noteworthy that tourists and environmentalists almost fully match in their assessments of criteria but not of the alternatives.
   Moreover, there is a great agreement in the final assessment. This suggests that the regular contact among the different stakeholders, i.e. tourists with inhabitants, authorities with environmentalists, tour operators with representatives of the ministry, etc. has led to a common understanding of the opportunities and threats for the NP. They all agreed that the procedure enhances participation and transparency and it is a necessary source of information and support for their decisions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - It is almost 6 years since the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were adopted, and countries have less than 10 years to achieve the set targets. Unlike most of the world, sub-Saharan African countries have reported only minimal progress, one that the COVID-19 pandemic has unfortunately disrupted. Transdisciplinary research (TDR) has been conceptualized as important for achieving sustainability goals such as the SDGs. In this paper we (i) analyze the contributions of the five TDR projects toward the achievements of the SDGs at the city level in Africa, and (ii) explore the interactions between the assessed SDGs across the five projects. The projects' contributions towards the achievements of the SDGs were examined in three thematic areas: (i) contexts, (ii) processes and (iii) products. The five projects were funded under the Leading Integrated Research for Agenda 2030 in Africa (LIRA) programme. The projects were being implemented in nine cities across five African countries Accra (Ghana), Kumasi (Ghana), Korhogo (Ivory Coast), Abuja Metro (Nigeria), Mbour (Senegal), Cape Town (South Africa), Nelson Mandela Bay Metro (South Africa), Grahamstown (South Africa) and Kampala (Uganda) and data were collected on each of the five projects in these cities. The contextual contributions include co-analysis and reflection on policy and institutional silos and social innovations amenable to contextual complexity. A shift in how actors perceived and conceptualized sustainability challenges and the role of the projects as transformative social agents constituted the two main process contributions. Tool development, virtual models and maps, and handbook are the product contributions by the projects. Our analysis of the SDG interactions indicated the need for cross-sectoral collaborations to ensures resource use efficiency, knowledge and experience sharing, and seamless flow of information and data to accelerate the SDG implementation.

AB  - Transformation has become a major topic of sustainability research. This opens up new perspectives, but at the same time, runs the danger to convert into a new critical orthodoxy which narrows down analytical perspectives. Most research is committed towards a political-strategic approach towards transformation. This focus, however, clashes with ongoing transformation processes towards un-sustainability. The paper presents cornerstones of an integrative approach to social-ecological transformations (SET), which builds upon empirical work and conceptual considerations from Social Ecology and Political Ecology. We argue that a critical understanding of the challenges for societal transformations can be advanced by focusing on the interdependencies between societies and the natural environment. This starting point provides a more realistic understanding of the societal and biophysical constraints of sustainability transformations by emphasising the crisis-driven and contested character of the appropriation of nature and the power relations involved. Moreover, it pursues a transdisciplinary mode of research, decisive for adequately understanding any strategy for transformations towards sustainability. Such a conceptual approach of SET is supposed to better integrate the analytical, normative and political-strategic dimension of transformation research. We use the examples of global land use patterns, neo-extractivism in Latin America and the global water crisis to clarify our approach.

AB  - The demand for natural fibers, including silk, is steadily rising, yet research on transitioning the silk industry from a traditional linear model to a circular economy still needs to grow. This study addresses this gap by outlining areas of interest to support silk companies in applying circular practices to achieve sustainability. To this end, ten semi-structured interviews with silk industry experts were carried out, and a thematic analysis was conducted, integrating findings from the extant literature to enhance the depth and contextualization of the results. Six critical themes emerged: waste utilization, circular approaches, consumer education, technology advancement, traceability and transparency, and governmental regulations. The findings reveal that production waste, such as mulberry branches, silkworm litter, low-grade cocoons, and sericin, can be repurposed into fertilizers, animal feed, cosmetics, and textiles, offering both environmental and economic benefits. Circular practices like designing for product longevity, minimizing chemical usage, reusing silk garments, and promoting recycling are key to achieving resource optimization and waste reduction. Technology advancements, including artificial intelligence and blockchain, enhance efficiency and ensure traceability and transparency, fostering stakeholder trust. Consumer education is also vital for creating awareness regarding sustainable practices. Additionally, government policies play a transformative role by supporting training programs, incentivizing innovation, and driving circularity within the industry. This study proposed a theoretical framework that offers actionable insights to industry practitioners, researchers, and policymakers for embedding circularity throughout the silk industry, contributing to global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly responsible consumption and production. Future research should explore barriers to attaining circularity and use mixed methodologies to accelerate the silk industry's transition to a circular economy.

AB  - Participatory projects supporting the farmer-based seed management of agrobiodiverse varieties including landraces have proliferated globally in response to nutritional insecurity and climate change. This research examines the agroecological landscape knowledge of farmers in a recent participatory seed project using the tricot approach in Central America. Over 800 smallholder farmers in Nicaragua facilitated on-farm trials of diverse common bean varieties that are nutritiously valuable and potentially well-adapted to increased temperatures and variable precipitation. Our article integrates relevant research concepts in a case study of the agroecological landscape knowledge of 52 participating farmers. Participatory sketch maps, transect walks, and semi-structured interviews were used to identify key areas of farmers' agroecological landscape knowledge in crop and seed management. Results indicate the prevalence of nine themes of farmer agroecological landscape knowledge. This landscape knowledge exerts major influence on the choice, placement, and management of common bean varieties and associated land use decisions. Our analysis reveals that farmers use this knowledge to manage their landholdings as landscapes of agroecological interactions that guide seed and variety management and affect potential sustainability. Results demonstrate that local agroecological landscape learning is strengthened through and benefits participatory seed projects.

AB  - In remote mountain tourist destinations across Pakistan, the issue of insufficient public funds for effective management and operations is prevalent. To address this concern, an effective strategy involves introducing entrance fees for designated tourist destinations. This study delves into tourists' willingness to pay for such entry fees, focusing specifically on the Hunza Valley. To conduct this investigation, empirical data from 1046 tourists were collected through on-site surveys, employing the contingent valuation survey method and statistical model was subsequently estimated using the logistic regression technique. This study reveals that a significant 69.6% of the respondents expressed their willingness to pay an entry fee, should it be introduced. It argues that introducing an entry fee is unlikely to significantly impact tourist arrivals confirming that the demand for tourism experiences is not greatly influenced by the presence of such fees. This study identifies various influential factors, including the bid price, income levels, tourists' age, type of recreational activities, and duration of stay that play a significant role in shaping tourists' willingness to pay. Drawing from these insights, this study argues that the introduction of entrance fees at tourist destinations has the potential to address the financial challenges linked to site maintenance and management. However, it underscores the crucial need to establish a robust institutional mechanism for implementing such fees and such mechanism should be developed in close collaboration with pertinent stakeholders in the tourism sector, which in turn helps to achieve sustainable tourism development in the region.

AB  - Efforts to sustain multi-scalar benefit flows from forests increasingly concentrate on interventions in landscapes. Integrated landscape approaches have emerged as the dominant paradigm among international agencies for reconciling competing land uses. Small and medium forest enterprises receive growing attention for their ability to meet local development aspirations while supporting healthy forest ecosystems. Despite their prevalence in forest sustainability initiatives, landscape approaches and small and medium enterprises have not yet been integrated into a holistic framework. Here, we conceptually integrate the two phenomena using place as a guiding concept. We examined peer-reviewed literature to understand cultural, socio-political, and biophysical attributes and processes that influence outcomes of small and medium forest enterprises. We then held a series of seminars to discuss empirical and theoretical advances in landscape approaches and the role of small and medium forest enterprises. From this, we identified areas of complementarity, where investments might lead to mutual gains for prosperous and sustainable forest landscapes. We propose four overarching synergies between integrated landscape approaches and small and medium forest enterprises: (I) collective organization, decision-making, and action, (II) empowerment, rights, and tenure security, (III) coherent policy and commitment across governance scales, and (IV) managing for multiple functions and values within planetary boundaries. To increase understanding of these synergies in local contexts, researchers and practitioners could share lessons from place-based sustainability science, contributing to learning systems for inclusive benefit flows in forest landscapes.

AB  - In the era of disruption, to achieve both food sustainability and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), Indonesia must face changes in the values, attitudes, and behavior of the community, and adapt to environmental and technological changes. This study aims to analyze the factors that influence social transformation in peri-urban communities, and their impact on food sustainability and the achievement of SDGs. The research method is a qualitative approach, triangulated by conducting in-depth interviews, field observations, and focus group discussions (FGD) in two districts, the Majalengka and Karawang Regency, West Java Province. The results showed that factors influencing social transformation in peri-urban communities include strengthening public awareness of the importance of food sustainability, access to information and technology, collaborative synergy of government, companies, academics, and community participation in decision-making on empowerment programs. This social transformation leads to increased food production and poverty reduction. Private facilitators through CSR programs play a role in achieving both food sustainability and several SDG indicators related to poverty. The occurrence of collaborative synergy between community participation, extension workers, village government, media utilization, academics, and companies contributes significantly to transforming the values, attitudes, and behavior of people managing community resources.

AB  - Scholars and funding bodies alike are increasingly calling for transformative research that delivers socially robust and impact-oriented outcomes. This paper argues that the Human Scale Development approach (HSDA) introduced by Max-Neef and colleagues in Latin America during the 1980s can serve as a method for transformative science (TSc). HSDA is both a theory and a participatory methodology and thus contributes toward fulfilling the objectives of TSc, which are scientific, practical and educational. In this paper, we begin by explicating how the fundamental human needs (FHN) approach of the HSDA can support scholars and practitioners alike in addressing complex sustainability challenges. We then refer to the methodological adaptations to the original proposal that we have previously developed to illustrate how Max-Neef's methodological approach might be further extended and to demonstrate how these changes can strengthen HSDA and make it even more useful for generating knowledge needed in sustainability transformations. To inform and support research that builds on the co-production of knowledge, we test HSDA with regard to TSc quality criteria and show how it adds value to the existing canon of TSc methods. To this end, we develop an analytical framework that can be deployed to assess the quality of TSc methods.

AB  - According to the targets set for sustainability, integrating the principles of sustainable development into country policies and programs is one of the main goals for development projects. A major challenge in the development field is cross-sectoral integrated planning and achieving multi-stakeholder consensus for collaborative joint projects, especially when sustainability is a goal. This increases the complexity of the multi-stakeholder interaction in decision making and requires enhanced mechanisms for stakeholder participation, coordination, and commitment beyond narrow self-interest. A critical aspect in the decision making process is to enable stakeholders to not only interpret and make decisions based on expert judgments, but also to appropriately involve the relevant parties in the research and decision making process. Therefore, scientific analyses in multi-stakeholder contexts have to be more transparent, participatory, and stakeholder-based in order to provide useful information to assist responsible decision making.
   This paper presents an outline of a stakeholder-based life cycle assessment approach that can be used to support sustainable decision making in multi-stakeholder contexts. The framework is discussed and compared to other common methods used to support environmental decision making in development projects. We argue that the fundamental concept of life cycle thinking can be effectively used to incorporate stakeholders in the research and decision making process, which can lead to more comprehensive, yet achievable assessments in collaboration with stakeholders. Life cycle thinking is not just a way to examine environmental impacts of activities, but also a way to comprehend and visualize a broader set of upstream and downstream consequences of decisions in development planning and implementation. A life cycle framework including the mapping of stakeholder involvement at each activity in upstream and downstream stages would give stakeholders a holistic view that they otherwise may not have.

TI  - Exploring possibilities of organisational learning-based change and transition towards sustainability
T2  - LEARNING FOR SUSTAINABILITY IN TIMES OF ACCELERATING CHANGE
LA  - English
AB  - Organisations face challenges in addressing sustainability issues that arise from accelerated changing economic, political and social contexts. Viewed as social systems, organisations possess structural and cultural factors that both enable and constrain learning-based change and transition towards sustainability. This chapter provides a reflexive case study that analyses possibilities and dilemmas of facilitating organisational learning-based change and sustainability. It draws upon a critical action research study that was conducted at the National Museums of Kenya (NMK) to investigate organisational learning and sustainability in times of accelerating change. The research process involved a group of middle level management employees of the NMK in identifying and collectively acting on sustainability issues. The group was designed and cultivated as a community of practice for organisational learning purposes. The basic premise underlying the chapter is that exploring 'morphogenetic relationships' through 'communicative interactions' in a cultivated community of practice can deepen context specific understanding of organisational learning-based change and transition towards sustainability. This argument is advanced by drawing upon three distinct and yet related theoretical perspectives of Archerian morphogenetic approach, Habermasian critical theory and the Lave and Wenger's communities of practice approach. Through the chapter, I analyse possibilities and dilemmas of facilitating organisational learning-based change as morphogenetic relationships that tend to enable or constrain emergence of sustainability. I present four interrelated dynamics of communicative interaction as a basis for developing agential capabilities and reflexivity for social change and emergence of sustainability. They are dynamics of enhancing critical reflections, promoting democratic deliberations, enhancing systemic thinking and promoting social action and innovation. In conclusion, I explore the question: How can we institutionalise social change processes and the emergence of sustainability in organisations?

AB  - The study aims to investigate how the internet has affected China's financial inclusion from the standpoint of developing internet technologies. Firstly, using the coefficient of variation method and the principal component analysis method, the financial inclusion index (IFI) and the internet development index (INT) were built from multiple dimensions based on the 2006-2016 provincial panel data of China. Then, the fixed-effect panel threshold model, the fixed-effect estimate, and the 2SLS estimate were used to empirically test the impact of internet development on inclusive finance in China. We found that China's financial inclusion was significantly and positively affected by internet development. Additionally, this effect was nonlinear, and there was a threshold effect on the proportion of internet users. The development of the internet had a significant positive effect on financial inclusion when the internet user proportion (ISP) was higher than 19%, and the effect on IFI became stronger when ISP rose above 53%. This study complements earlier research, in which internet finance is usually perceived as a composite notion, by thoroughly examining the effects of internet information technology on the growth of financial inclusion. Based on our findings, we further put forward policy recommendations for the sustainable development of inclusive finance in terms of the intelligent integration and collaboration of internet communication technologies. Financial inclusion is critical for achieving sustainability because it provides access to affordable financial services to underserved individuals and businesses, and brings them into the formal financial sector, thereby improving their livelihoods while reducing poverty and inequality.

AB  - Crop diversification represents a key lever to support the development of sustainable agri-food systems. Knowledge on trade-offs and carry over effects from different crop diversification strategies is essential to inform agricultural stakeholders of potential costs and benefits. This knowledge is limited by existing data and performance measures predominantly focused on single crops, rather than complete rotations. Moreover, sustainability performance indicators are often used for assessment purposes, rather than supporting stakeholder learning and actions. A new set of 32 indicators was developed to address these needs, and used to evaluate the environmental, economic and social sustainability of the diversified agricultural systems highlighted in the case studies, which are often characterized by data availability constraints. This approach was tested in France, Germany and Italy to determine a critical ex-post diagnosis of the existing systems, and for the assessment of ex-ante innovative scenarios. The results will be used to support these case studies in the identification and design of more sustainable agricultural systems. Although the framework is based on feasible and proxy indicators, the assessment outcomes have allowed local actors to reflect on the effects generated by the implemented crop diversification strategies. Key issues include trade-offs occurring between optimizing economic and environmental performance.

AB  - Sustainable forest management usually involves the use of criteria and indicators (C&I) allowing the monitoring, reporting and assessment of management activities at national, regional and forest management unit levels. Experiences of such concepts are scarce in Nepal, particularly with regard to the evaluation of management activities within a Multi-Criteria Analysis (MCA) framework. In this contribution we describe how a MCA approach can be used to efficiently exploit information, knowledge, and preferences of stakeholders to address community forest management problems. Beside rating and ranking techniques, the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is used to examine the importance of six criteria and forty-four indicators in a sustainable forest management context with a broad range of stakeholder groups. An evaluation of four management strategies in the Shree Gyneshwar community forest user group allows to demonstrate the relevance of changing priorities for different criteria. A passive adaptive management strategy focusing on a multiple use of natural resources and the introduction of production-oriented measures were identified as the most preferable option. The results of this study show that the multi-criteria analysis approach, and in particular the AHP, can assist decision-makers in efficiently evaluating management problems and generating ideas for the long-term strategic planning process of community forest management, even under complex socio-economic and ecological conditions. In that context, compromise solutions enjoy a higher possibility of being successful, taking into account the different views of stakeholder groups.

AB  - With the development of society and the times, the socialist modernization cause in China is constantly developing, and the improvement of the economy has also driven the development of rural ecotourism industry in China. The unique natural terrain and cultural customs in rural areas have promoted the continuous development of local ecotourism industry, which has had a positive impact on the economic development of rural areas and not only solved the employment problem of the majority of the population in rural areas. It can also bring a continuous stream of economic benefits and continuously improve the living standards of local residents. Rural ecotourism refers to a rural tourism activity that takes place in rural areas, supported by the agricultural industry, and attracted by the rural environment and typical rural ecotourism resources, with the concept of ecotourism. Rural ecotourism mainly takes the form of rural scenery, agricultural participation, and folk experience, integrating sightseeing experience, cognition, and tourism activities. The main principles of rural tourism development are agricultural support, people-oriented, ecological protection, community participation, income feedback, and ecological home construction. The sustainable development evaluation of rural ecotourism is a classical multiple-attribute decision-making (MADM) issue. In such paper, the generalized weighted Bonferroni mean (GWBM) operator and power average (PA) is constructed for MADM with single-valued neutrosophic sets (SVNSs). Then, the single-valued neutrosophic number power generalized BM (SVNNPGBM) operator is built and then the MADM decision methods are proposed based on the SVNNPGBM operator. Finally, an example for sustainable development evaluation of rural ecotourism and some comparative analysis were given to demonstrate the SVNNPGBM method.

AB  - PurposeThe aim of this paper is to outline the collaborative approach used to craft national learning standards for tertiary programs in the field of environment and sustainability in Australia. The field of environment and sustainability is broad and constituted by diverse stakeholders. As such, articulating a common set of learning standards presents challenges. Design/methodology/approachThe authors developed and used a staged collaborative curriculum design methodology to engage more than 250 stakeholders in tertiary environmental education, including discipline scholars, students, professional associations and employers and other environmental educators. The approach was adaptive, to ensure underrepresented stakeholders' perspectives were welcomed and recognised. The project was commissioned by the Australian Council of Environmental Deans and Directors (ACEDD) and funded by the Federal Government's Office for Learning and Teaching. FindingsThe collaborative approach developed and used for this work facilitated an inclusive process that valued diversity of perspectives, rather than marginalise diversity in favour of a perspective representing a minimum level of agreement. This is reflected in the standards themselves, and is evidenced by participant feedback, piloting of the standards and their subsequent application at multiple universities. Achieving this required careful planning and facilitation, to ensure a democratisation of the stakeholder consultation process, and to build consensus in support of the standards. Endorsement by ACEDD formalised the standards' status. Originality/valueCollaborative curriculum design offered the opportunity to foster a shared sense of common purpose amongst diverse environmental education stakeholders. This approach to curriculum design is intensive and generative but uncommon and may be usefully adapted and applied in other contexts. The authors note one subsequent instance where the approach has been further developed and applied in transforming a generalist science program, suggesting the methodology used in this case may be applied across other contexts, albeit with appropriate adjustments: the authors offer it here in the spirit of supporting others in their own complex curriculum design challenges.

AB  - PurposeInternational research and organisations focused on Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) have, for years, addressed the problem of the underrepresentation of women in careers in these fields. This issue is critical when considering that diversity in working teams can provide enhanced solutions to pressing world problems. However, empirical studies have recently shown that careers related to the environment and sustainability are more appealing to women. In this context, this study aims to explore whether female participation has an enhanced role in the incorporation of sustainability processes at a STEM higher education entity.Design/methodology/approachThis case study of the Faculty of Physical and Mathematical Sciences at the University of Chile (FPMS) was examined as a descriptive statistical analysis. It was developed using a two-scope methodology: the historical perspective and the current state lens in the main higher education dimensions of teaching, research and outreach. A set of indicators was created to demonstrate whether the engagement of women in sustainability-focused endeavours was significantly higher than in activities or areas that are not closely related to sustainable development.FindingsThe main findings show that within the FPMS, sustainability has provided a space for women to further engage and become change agents in a STEM environment. This case study finds that sustainability is an area of interest and attraction for women in engineering and science at the higher education level, with the potential implications of challenging existing gender stereotypes in STEM disciplines and contributing to meeting sustainability standards by increasing diversity within teams.Originality/valueTo the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to adopt this approach and research question in Chile and Latin America.

AB  - The platform is a comprehensive digital technology carrier that can facilitate the digitization of sales and make it possible to directly connect farmers and consumers. Multi-owner collaboration in logistics may considerably improve efficiency and sustainability, which is crucial for agricultural logistics. This paper introduces a logistics collaboration mechanism for agricultural products of 'Farmer + Consumer Integration Purchase' based on platform information openness and resource sharing. First, the Multi-owner Collaborative Vehicle Routing Problem with Heterogeneous Fleets and Time Windows (MOHFCVRPTW) model was designed. Second, the developed solution is the Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search Heuristic Algorithm (ALNS), which can solve 2n-1 (n is the number of enterprises) sub-alliances corresponding to the collaborative problem at once and produce the scheme and cost. Third, the Shapley value method is used to design a scientific and reasonable cost-sharing mechanism to allocate the total cost of the alliance to each logistics enterprise. Finally, the validity of the mechanism and the model are verified in the context of real logistics networks in Qingdao and Shanghai, and the profit of farmers is quantified by considering the cost of loss of agricultural products. The research found that the logistics collaboration mechanism has achieved cost savings for logistics enterprises, reduced carbon emissions, and improved transportation timeliness. At the same time, losses on agricultural products have been significantly reduced, and farmers' profits have increased. In addition, with the expansion of the scale of the alliance, the increase in the diversity of transport vehicles, and the improvement in the distribution aggregation degree of farmers, the benefits of the collaborative operation mode are more significant. The platform enables the exchange matching and collaborative transportation of agricultural products rapidly and has significant sustainable benefits, which has guiding significance for the practical development of 'Farmer + Consumer Integration Purchase'.

AB  - Worldwide, marine conflicts are growing in frequency and intensity due to increasing global demands for resources (Blue Growth) and climate change. This article introduces a collection in Maritime Studies on marine conflicts and pathways to sustainability in an era of Blue Growth and climate change. We posit that while conflict can be problematic, it can also play a positive role in bringing about societal change, by highlighting unsustainable and unjust practices and be a trigger for sustainability transformation. However, left unattended, festering marine conflict can hinder just and equitable sustainability transformation. We present two distinct, yet arguably complementary, lenses through which researchers working with sustainability engage with marine conflicts. First, a social-ecological systems approach engages in conflicts by examining the interdependencies between human and ecological systems and related governance arrangements, promoting collaborative learning and action, and exploring adaptive governance strategies that seek sustainability conflict resolution. Second, a political ecology approach addresses conflicts by examining power dynamics and resource (mal)distributions, arguing for fair governance, and emphasizing the need to address historical and current injustices that are at the root of conflicts. Next, we present insights on diverse sustainability transformational pathways, including the importance of searching for common ground and the need for the reconfiguration of power relations as key steps to understand and inform sustainability conflict research. We conclude by indicating that more sustainability research in marine conflict settings is needed and by forwarding intersectionality as a promising approach to productively reframe and disrupt the debilitating effects of deep-rooted marine sustainability conflicts.

AB  - Shrimp is a major aquaculture species in Indonesia. Despite the Indonesian government's effort to reinforce sustainability practices using a national eco-certification scheme, the uptake of stakeholders has been slow so far. This study analyzed diverse perceptions of the national eco-certification of shrimp aquaculture among stakeholders across the value chain in Indonesia. Using Q-methodology, 49 statements were selected, and they covered seven themes: conceptual understanding, priorities, motivation for eco-certification, market access, impacts of eco-certification, obstacles in Indonesia, and stakeholder involvement. Thirty respondents across the supply chain of whiteleg shrimp sorted these statements according to their level of agreement. Based on their support or opposition to eco-certification, responses were categorized into five perspectives: (1) supporter for the certification by principle, (2) market-oriented supporter, (3) collaborative supporter, (4) ambivalent self-sufficient, and (5) antagonistic business-oriented. Several reasons for stakeholder's slow acceptance were identified. These include a limited understanding of sustainability concepts in eco-certification, uncertainty for the potential positive effects of eco-certification in terms of market access, the recognition of other priorities such as improving farm-infrastructures, and a lack of stakeholders' participation in communication forums. The findings of this study can facilitate the process of consensus-building on eco-certification among farmers, scientists, the government, non-governmental organizations, and other stakeholders to support a viable pathway for policy development to achieve sustainable shrimp aquaculture. Ultimately, this study provides new insights on how a country in the Global South perceives eco-certification differently from the Global North.

AB  - This paper aims to create a harmoniously blended thematic conceptual framework that incorporates project governance principles, built upon insights obtained from previous academic studies. This framework is positioned to offer significant benefits to the organisation by improving operational efficiency and aligning with strategic objectives. The authors adopted a qualitative research approach to analyse the key literature on the paper's theme. They carefully reviewed the theoretical underpinnings and categorised the contents to construct a step-by-step thematic conceptual framework aligned with the research's objectives. The study identifies four key elements in the suggested framework for project governance. These include maintaining the unity of functional diversity among key processes, creating value and practicing originality, maintaining a sequential governance application path through onion-shaped structure, and ensuring the availability of required project governance framework quality. The framework ensures projects achieve objectives, deliver value for money, and contribute to sustainable development through oversight, control, integration, benefits realization, stakeholder engagement, project culture, and leadership. Effective project governance requires clear goal delineation, well-structured plans, robust risk management protocols, and collaboration among stakeholders. Regular monitoring and assessment of project performance is crucial for achieving project objectives and contributing to sustainable development goals. Governance differs from management in its focus on strategic decision-making, driving investments in capabilities, and ensuring optimal resource allocation. In public sector development projects, incorporating effective project governance practices is crucial for delivering optimal value for invested resources, achieving predefined objectives, and achieving desired outcomes cost-efficiently and impact fully. This separation underscores the importance of governance in imbuing projects with sustainable value and fostering prudent decisions. The paper presents a thematic conceptual framework for project-centric entities, derived from extensive literature analysis. This framework offers a structured blueprint aligned with project objectives, fostering the twin goals of optimizing value for invested resources and nurturing project sustainability. By embracing this framework, organisations can enhance their capacity to deliver outcomes that meet benchmarks and maximise resource utilization, enhancing the overall value proposition of initiatives. The convergence of project implementers and governance entities is crucial for driving exceptional quality outputs and adhering to robust governance principles, ensuring project success and sustained effectiveness.

AB  - Background: Mobile phone text messaging has been shown to improve adherence to antiretroviral therapy and to improve communication between patients and health care workers. It is unclear which strategies are most appropriate for scaling up text messaging programmes. We sought to investigate acceptability and readiness for ownership (community members designing, sending and receiving text messages) of a text message programme among a community of clients living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in Yaounde, Cameroon and to develop a framework for implementation.
   Methods: We used the mixed-methods sequential exploratory design. In the qualitative strand we conducted 7 focus group discussions (57 participants) to elicit themes related to acceptability and readiness. In the quantitative strand we explored the generalizability of these themes in a survey of 420 clients. Qualitative and quantitative data were merged to generate meta-inferences.
   Results: Both qualitative and quantitative strands showed high levels of acceptability and readiness despite low rates of participation in other community-led projects. In the qualitative strand, compared to the quantitative strand, more potential service users were willing to pay for a text messaging service, preferred participation of health personnel in managing the project and preferred that the project be based in the hospital rather than in the community. Some of the limitations identified to implementing a community-owned project were lack of management skills in the community, financial, technical and literacy challenges. Participants who were willing to pay were more likely to find the project acceptable and expressed positive feelings about community readiness to own a text messaging project.
   Conclusion: Community ownership of a text messaging programme is acceptable to the community of clients at the Yaounde Central Hospital. Our framework for implementation includes components for community members who take on roles as services users (demonstrating clear benefits, allowing a trial period and ensuring high levels of confidentiality) or service providers (training in project management and securing sustainable funding). Such a project can be evaluated using participation rate, clinical outcomes, satisfaction with the service, cost and feedback from users.

AB  - Effective natural resource management is essential for balancing economic growth with environmental sustainability, especially in resource-intensive industries. This study addresses critical issues in natural resource management, with a particular focus on the mining industry. It incorporates digitalization and supply chain distribution within the framework of the circular economy to achieve sustainability, mitigate land degradation, and realize economic benefits. In response to challenges posed by climate change, resource scarcity, and land degradation, the circular economy has emerged as a key objective, particularly in resource-intensive sectors like mining. The primary research question aims to identify the criteria and strategies that effectively support the transition to a circular approach in mining operations. To investigate this, the study employed the fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (FAHP) method to assess various criteria and sub-criteria. Subsequently, the fuzzy technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (FTOPSIS) method was applied to rank the strategies, offering a comprehensive analysis of this decision-making challenge. The FAHP analysis indicates resource efficiency is the most crucial criterion, followed by supply chain and digital integration as top priorities. Additionally, the FTOPSIS analysis shows resource recovery systems, green logistics, and circular product design as the key strategies for fostering a circular economy approach within the mining sector. These findings give important guidance to policymakers and industry leaders. They help in creating sustainable strategies specifically for the mining industry. Through these strategies, stakeholders can achieve both environmental, economic, and social advantages.

AB  - The increasing complexity of urban regeneration issues has recently made multi-stakeholder collaboration an important part to solve policy problems. While residents form an important part in a variety of collaborative governance processes, approaches used are often criticized as too formal, and lacking more inclusive participation. Therefore, new informal mechanisms of collaboration are sought, to ensure a more effective engagement and representation of population groups. Although community-led participation is the approach that leads to a more effective collaborative process, issues of power and inequality are a challenge in many places in planning practice [13]. Ways of civic empowerment, communication, and negotiation provide participants with transformative learning opportunities so that not only their arguments change but also the participants of the participation process themselves [6]. In order to test urban development ideas, the notion of "urban experiment" has been developed in recent years as a recognized and effective approach. The urban environment is viewed as a creative laboratory for testing the implementation of diverse initiatives and innovations [8]. The inner-city neighbourhoods in many cities are struggling to ensure vitality and liveability, thus these areas often represent a widespread location of urban experiments. In addition to these questions, the problem of community representation manifests itself in many inner cities. The potential to transform city centre streets and vacant areas into user-friendly urban spaces and the impact of those transformations on the city's liveability were recently tested by Riga municipality. Urban experiments varied in scale and form, resulting in street pedestrianization, urban gardens, and other temporary initiatives, which allowed more space for walking and cycling, street sales, social events and other activities. Thus, the aim of this article is to explore processes of testbed planning with regard to the role of community participation in the designing, implementing, and analysing phases of the experiment. After presenting the findings, the article concludes with a discussion on factors that influence public participation in collaborative governance including communication, the balance of interests, and the degree of resident involvement in decision-making.

AB  - Wheat farming is of utter importance in every country around the world, since it is a critical crop that contributes to food security and rural development. Given this importance, this research work investigates trends, determinants, and spatial variability in Polish wheat production between the years 2004 and 2023, with a key interest in productivity, resilience, and sustainable farming. This work will apply spatiotemporal analysis, statistical modeling, and ARIMA forecasting in the identification of the environmental, economic, and policy factors that interact with the wheat yield. Determinants include climatic variables, temperature, and precipitation, production costs, and market prices. These results point to great regional disparities in yield; the apparently better regions, such as Opole and Pomerania, enjoy exceptionally good environmental conditions with good access to modern technology, while regions like Podlasie and Subcarpathia are characterized by poor soil quality and a shortage of resources. This paper has pointed out the need for differential intervention policies that could contribute to reducing such yield gaps, increasing resilience to climate change, and hence contributing to sustainable wheat production growth. The stabilized yields projected underline the resilience of the sector to various challenges, from climate variability to market fluctuations. The results also indicate how innovative practices, supported by enabling policy frameworks, are essential in the promotion of wheat production in an environmentally friendly way, such as precision agriculture. The present research work will provide useful tools for policymakers, researchers, and other stakeholders by providing active insights into how to achieve equitable and sustainable agricultural development in Poland.

AB  - University campus sustainability initiatives have proliferated over the last decade. We contend that such initiatives benefit from applying conceptual frameworks to help understand and guide their activities and from a focus on campus open space and natural areas management. Informed by an adaptive comanagement framework encompassing social learning, social capital, and shared action, we used semistructured interviews to examine student participation in the immediate response and longer-term policy formulation following a crisis that occurred in a campus natural area. Students exhibited social learning as demonstrated by reflection and the integration of new ideas through discussions with administrators and peers, as well as social capital through increased social trust, which led to a shift in perspective regarding norms of student-administrator interactions. Further, students participated in shared action, such as posting warning signs in dangerous areas, and importantly, through their contributions to longer-term campus natural area safety and recreational access policy. Three conditions explain student engagement in the adaptive comanagement process: the presence of a pre-existing student organization that had built bonding social capital and was committed to campus natural area stewardship, openness to multiple stakeholder viewpoints and commitment to action on the part of the university administration, and the presence of a crisis that spurred emotions and action. Based on these findings, we assert that student organizations can contribute to an adaptive comanagement process and that such a process is consistent with university and campus sustainability values related to the importance of student engagement, mental health, and learning.

AB  - This article examines the influence of social capital on the sustainable livelihood ability of rural households who are out of poverty, in order to promote the sustainable development of their livelihood. Based on the survey data of 371 out-of-poverty households in rural Jiangxi, we analyzed the relationship between social capital and households' sustainable livelihood ability using "Ordinary Least Square (OLS) + robust standard error " regression models and quantile regression models. Households' social capital was measured from the following three dimensions: social network, social participation, and social trust. The benchmark regression models showed that social capital index, social network, and social participation all had a significant positive effect on the sustainable livelihood ability of out-of-poverty households. However, the impact of social trust on sustainable livelihood ability was not significant. In addition, the quantile regression analysis results showed that social capital index, social network, social participation, and social trust all contributed the most to households with a low sustainable livelihood ability. Therefore, it is suggested to improve the social capital accumulation of out-of-poverty households from multiple dimensions, so as to enhance the sustainable livelihood ability of households and consolidate poverty-alleviation achievements.

AB  - Integrating H2O2 evolution with oxidative organic synthesis in a semiconductor-driven photoredox reaction is highly attractive since H2O2 and high-value chemicals can be concurrently produced using solar light as the only energy input. The dual-functional photocatalytic approach, free from sacrificial agents, enables simultaneous production of H2O2 and high-value organic chemicals. This strategy promises a green and sustainable organic synthesis with minimal greenhouse gas emissions. In this review, we first elucidate the fundamental principles of cooperative photoredox integration of H2O2 synthesis and selective organic oxidation with simultaneous utilization of photoexcited electrons and holes over semiconductor-based photocatalysts. Afterwards, a thorough review on the recent advancements of cooperative photoredox synthesis of H2O2 and value-added chemicals is presented. Notably, in-depth discussions and insights into the techniques for unravelling the photoredox reaction mechanisms are elucidated. Finally, critical challenges and prospects in this thriving field are comprehensively discussed. It is envisioned that this review will serve as a pivotal guidance on the rational design of such dual-functional photocatalytic system, thereby further stimulating the development of economical and environmentally benign H2O2 and high-value chemicals production.

AB  - Consumer demands and current legislation require intensive greenhouse horticulture to be sustainable. This poses the challenge of how to teach the concept of sustainable horticulture to all professionals involved in farming. The province of Almeria, in the south-east of Spain, is one of the major horticulture greenhouse areas in Europe, and an expert panel of relevant stakeholders was invited to look into the best pedagogical practices and methods to transfer technology and knowledge, with the goal of improving the sustainability of greenhouse horticulture. A combination of an online questionnaire, a Delphi method, and desk research was, therefore, used as the strategy to collect the data and implement the research design during 2021. On-farm/business demonstrations, virtual education, and classroom education were common pedagogical methods used. On-farm/business demonstrations, participatory education, and co-learning were identified as the best pedagogical methods to use in sustainable agriculture/horticulture training. The expert panel also concluded that participatory education and co-learning should be further explored whereas virtual and classroom education should play a less dominant role in the training activities. This knowledge can help training organizations and designers to avoid common mistakes, tailor their training activities, and be mindful of common barriers and (mis)conceptions.

AB  - To identify the research trends in studies related to STEM Clubs, 56 publications that met the inclusion and extraction criteria were identified from the online databases ERIC and WoS in this study. These studies were analysed by using the descriptive content analysis research method based on the Paper Classification Form (PCF), which includes publishing years, keywords, research methods, sample levels and sizes, data collection tools, data analysis methods, durations, purposes, and findings. The findings showed that, the keywords in the studies were used under six different categories: disciplines, technological concepts, academic community, learning experiences, core elements of education, and psychosocial factors (variables). Case studies were frequently employed, with middle school students serving as the main participants in sample groups ranging from 11-15, 16-20, and 201-250. Surveys, questionnaires, and observations were the primary methods of data collection, and descriptive analysis was commonly used for data analysis. STEM Clubs had sessions ranging from 2 to 16 weeks, with each session commonly lasting 60 to 120 min. The study purposes mainly focused on four themes: the impact of participation on various aspects such as attitudes towards STEM disciplines, career paths, STEM major selection, and academic achievement; the development and implementation of a sample STEM Club program, including challenges and limitations; the examination of students' experiences, perceptions, and factors influencing their involvement and choice of STEM majors; the identification of some aspects such as attitudinal effects and non-academic skills; and the comparison of STEM experiences between in-school and out-of-school settings. The study results mainly focused on three themes: the increase in various aspects such as academic achievement, STEM major choice, engagement in STEM clubs, identity, interest in STEM, collaboration-communication skills; the design of STEM Clubs, including sample implementations, design principles, challenges, and factors affecting their success and sustainability; and the identification of factors influencing participation, motivation, and barriers. Overall, this study provides a comprehensive understanding of STEM Clubs, leading the way for more targeted and informed future research endeavours.

AB  - Strategic sourcing has long been utilized by organizations to maximize budget efficiency. The process includes a spend analysis, which historically has been performed by identifying the commodities and services purchased that resulted in the greatest spend, and establishing contracts with suppliers for these items in an effort to decrease the overall price through quantity discounts. This process restricts the data used in the spend analysis process to basic transactional information, and has not considered corporate social responsibility objectives as part of the strategic sourcing process. This paper modifies an existing spend analysis process framework, and applies the framework in a case study that uses additional data points to identify opportunities that allow an organization to simultaneously achieve both strategic purchasing and social responsibility objectives. The case study uses healthcare purchasing data from eight Department of Veterans Affairs medical centers. The goal of the model generated using regression analysis in the case study is to determine the buy characteristics that are most likely to generate mandated savings within the medical centers, in conjunction with achieving sustainability goals. The extensions of the regression model were examined to determine how collaborative buyer/supplier relationships can achieve organizational strategic objectives.

AB  - In recent years, China has emerged as a crucial trading partner for Latin America, particularly Brazil. Both countries are major greenhouse gas emitters striving to achieve climate goals and a net-zero future. In 2023, Brazil and China's new Joint Statement on combating climate change reaffirmed their commitment to expanding bilateral cooperation in climate actions and sustainability. However, China has significant influence over agricultural practices and deforestation in the pan-Amazon region because of being a substantial importer of Brazilian beef and soybeans. Meanwhile, during the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP28), Brazil's State-owned oil company, Petrobras, entered into agreements with Chinese firms to accelerate its energy transition while paradoxically continuing significant investments in the oil sector. Dispute cases also reveal that, despite the outward appearance of harmonious bilateral cooperation between the two countries, local communities and indigenous peoples who rely on the Amazon Forest experience environmental degradation, habitat destruction, displacement and human rights violations. In light of the apparent contradictions mentioned earlier, this article aims to assess whether China and Brazil have genuinely established a sustainable partnership or if there is evidence of a phenomenon often referred to as 'green grabbing'. By comparing their efforts with an advanced modern bilateral agreement in this field, the Singapore-Australia Green Economy Agreement, this article aims to create a conceptual framework that captures the key elements for sustainability and peacebuilding within the context of their bilateral engagement.

AB  - In this paper, we reflect on the implications for science, policy and practice of the recently introduced concept of Nature-Based Solutions (NBS), with a focus on the European context. First, we analyse NBS in relation to similar concepts, and reflect on its relationship to sustainability as an overarching framework. From this, we derive a set of questions to be addressed and propose a general framework for how these might be addressed in NBS projects by funders, researchers, policy-makers and practitioners. We conclude that:
   (1) NBS need to be developed and discussed in relation to existing concepts to clarify their added value;
   (2) When considering and implementing NBS, the 'relabelling' of related concepts and the misuse of the concept have to be prevented in order to avoid misunderstanding, duplication and unintended consequences;
   3) NBS as currently framed by the European Commission provides an opportunity for: a) transdisciplinary research into the design and implementation of solutions based on nature; and b) overcoming a bias towards development alternatives with narrow perspectives that focus on short-term economic gains and effectiveness;
   (4) The strength of the NBS concept is its integrative, systemic approach which prevents it from becoming just another "green communication tool" that provides justification for a classical model of natural resource exploitation and management measures.
   To realise their full potential, NBS must be developed by including the experience of all relevant stakeholders such that 'solutions' contribute to achieving all dimensions of sustainability. As NBS are developed, we must also moderate the expectations placed on them since the precedent provided by other initiatives whose aim was to manage nature sustainably demonstrates that we should not expect NBS to be cheap and easy, at least not in the short-term.

AB  - Purpose - This paper scrutinizes existing assessment methodologies in supply chain sustainability literature and identifies a gap in microeconomic methods for comprehensively estimating current and prospective supply chain performances, encompassing both financial and environmental aspects. It presents a case study where quantitative, dynamic simulation modeling is applied to articulate and amplify a company's sustainability performance, demonstrating that a holistic approach to performance metrics can significantly refine decision-making and action prioritization in sustainability. Design/methodology/approach - Introduced here is the "ISSSC Approach, " which employs dynamic simulation modeling to quantify the flux of materials, value, and emissions within a supply chain. This methodology facilitates the construction of representative models and subsequent scenarios to inform sustainable decision-making that aligns with business objectives. The utility of the ISSSC Approach is evidenced through a case study within the dairy industry. Findings - The case study offers three pivotal insights: the innovation of a fact-based sustainability framework over traditional anecdotal methods, the harmonization of competitive and sustainable performance indicators within a company's strategic ambit, and the presentation of a novel tool for precise sustainability measurement and enhancement, attuned to context-specific constraints. Originality/value - While dynamic simulation modeling is well-established, its application to sustainability in a manufacturing context is markedly innovative. The ISSSC Approach bridges the gap between regulatory directives and the realization of tangible benefits for all stakeholders, positioning it as a critical tool for operationalizing sustainability in corporate strategy.

AB  - The chemical industry has growing importance in sustainability because of the potential adverse effects on the environment. Also, stakeholders emphasize many social issues besides environmental protection for the chemical industry. Relying on a solid supplier base has become the main prerequisite for chemical manufacturers to achieve environmental targets and fulfill stakeholders' expectations while remaining competitive. This study develops the Integrated Sustainable Supplier Evaluation & Development Framework (ISSED-F) to support chemical manufacturers with managing supplier relationships according to the economic, environmental, and social facets of sustainability. Although the literature is rife with evaluation models aiming to fulfill the supplier selection tasks, these models mostly ignore the developmental role of supplier evaluation. To remedy this gap, ISSED-F adopts a deductive and holistic approach from setting the criteria to setting the measurement structure, evaluating the suppliers, and developing the suppliers. Materiality analysis, Analytic Network Process (ANP), Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluation (PROMETHEE), and cluster analysis are the fundamental methods that constitute the ISSED-F structure. A case study presents the use of the ISSED-F in a transnational chemical manufacturer's supplier relationship management (SRM) process. The case company evaluates 69 suppliers and assigns development strategies to the relevant performance segments within the implementation. The successful implementation of ISSED-F shows that it can be a roadmap for chemical manufacturers to adopt sustainability practices and ensure continuous development in their supply chains.

AB  - There is a growing concern that business enterprises and their supply chains focus primarily on economic activities and ignore their impact on the environment and society. This paper aims to help decision makers, managers, and practitioners to achieve economic growth, societal development, and environmental protection by developing sustainable supply chain performance measures and proposes a partner selection and flow allocation decision-making model. Survey data from 278 business organizations from the Indian apparel industry supply chain network were used, and an integrated method of structural equation modeling, fuzzy analytical hierarchy process, and fuzzy multi-objective linear programming was applied to the proposed model. The results of the structural equation modeling analysis indicate that the survey respondents considered sustainable production performance to be of prime importance, which thus indicates its significance in developing a sustainable supply chain for the apparel industry. To illustrate the use of the proposed model for partner selection and flow allocation decision making, real-time data from an apparel manufacturer are presented. Optimal results were obtained for two strategies sustainahility and cost saving-to show a cost-benefit trade-off when developing a sustainable supply chain. Using comparative performance, a decision maker can choose an appropriate strategy based on cost benefit analysis of the presented trade-offs. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All tights reserved.

AB  - It seems inevitable that the ongoing and rapid changes in the physical environment of the marine Arctic will push components of the region's existing social-ecological systems-small and large-beyond tipping points and into new regimes. Ongoing changes include warming, freshening, acidification, and alterations to food web structure. In anticipation we pose three distinct but interrelated challenges: (1) to explore existing connectivities within components of the marine system; (2) to seek indicators (if they exist) of approaching regime change through observation and modeling; and (3) to build functional resilience into existing systems through adaptation-oriented policy and to have in hand transformative options when tipping points are crossed and new development trajectories are required. Each of the above challenges is scale dependent, and each requires a much deeper understanding than we currently have of connectivity within existing systems and their response to external forcing. Here, we argue from a global perspective the need to understand the Arctic's role in an increasingly nonlinear world; then describe emerging evidence from new observations on the connectivity of processes and system components from the Canada Basin and subarctic seas surrounding northern North America; and finally posit an approach founded in "resilience thinking" to allow northern residents living in small coastal communities to participate in the observation, adaption and-if necessary-transformation of the social-ecological system with which they live.

AB  - Recruitment, retention, and preparation of students in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields are critical to meeting the global challenges of the 21st century. Gamification-game playing concepts used in another activity-has been postulated as an active teaching strategy that engages students, encourages a sense of community, and develops students' professional skills, which are all core components to recruitment, retention, and preparation. To explore the impact of game design and play on students' higher levels of perceived cognitive/learning engineering-related and course-specific concepts, higher levels of student engagement, a sense of community, professional skills, retention, and easy transferability for university-level educators, board game design and play projects were implemented in three civil, environmental, and construction engineering courses at the University of Pittsburgh, Arizona State University, and Clemson University in 2016. Findings obtained from analyzing students' responses to an open-ended survey and focus group questions indicated that game design and play were effective in learning technical course content, including content related to sustainability and construction terminology, but these results were related to lower levels of Bloom's taxonomy. Both the classroom observations and the focus group/interviews revealed that game design and game play enhanced engagement. The Likert survey results did not show a statistically significant difference in the sense of community but did show a statistically significant positive difference in the professional skill of writing. Lastly, neither the Likert survey results nor the focus group/interview results showed that game design and play impacted retention. Given these results, the findings of this study are cautiously optimistic at best for the applications of game design and play in engineering curricula as a method for recruiting, retaining, and preparing students. Recommendations for improving game design studies as well as the implementation of game design projects in engineering courses are provided. (C) 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Improving sustainability knowledge is crucial to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This article highlights the role of multi-stakeholder partnerships (MSPs) in fostering sustainable development knowledge in higher education institutions. The purpose of this study is to investigate the importance of collaboration and stakeholder engagement for the adoption and impact of an MSP. The method is based on the case-study of Sulitest: an international MSP developing open online tools to raise and map sustainability literacy. Sulitest engages different stakeholders to co-develop and disseminate online tools according to the stakeholder context. Sulitest is also a data-provider for academic research investigating the advancement of Education for Sustainable Development (ESD). This study uses a sample of 61,376 students in 33 countries having taken the Sustainability Literacy Test between September 2016 and December 2018 to estimate the advancement of students' knowledge and understanding of the 17 SDGs and their systemic nature. Factorial analysis allows to map the dimensions of sustainability literacy related to the level of engagement and collaboration in this MSP. The results show that active collaboration, stakeholder engagement, and membership in international networks act as important factors of adoption of this initiative. The analysis also highlights the role of exposure to education in order to enhance sustainability literacy and to develop a systemic perspective of sustainability.

AB  - Teaching and learning in higher education have increasingly become digitalized and associated with innovative pedagogical methodologies over the past decades. Following the sudden onset of the pandemic in March 2020, several studies tended to focus on traditional students' experiences with emergency remote education while literature is scarce on non-traditional students (or adult learners) pedagogical experiences in Distance Education contexts. Using a qualitative case study approach, this study explored how digital technologies mediated instructors' and adult learners' educational experiences during COVID-19 and their first-time experiences with blended learning. Between October 2021 and July 2022, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 40 adult learners and 20 instructors in three selected public higher education institutions (HEIs) in Ghana. Data analysis followed Braun and Clarke's (2012) thematic analysis approach. The results showed that the transition to blended learning was supported by the adoption and integration of varied virtual online technologies. The themes highlight the positive and negative impacts of technology in mediating the educational experiences of instructors and adult learners in blended learning environments. The themes which reflected both instructors' and adult learners' experiences were enhanced course delivery and pedagogy, competency development, technological issues and poor-quality pedagogy. Blended learning facilitated by technology could be the 'new normal learning' post-pandemic for adult learners pursuing Distance Education in Ghana. The study recommends the implementation of agile strategies and policies by HEIs to ensure sustainable quality education in distance learning. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated the adoption of innovative pedagogical approaches in higher education contexts. Technological transformations in information and communication technology (ICT) have enhanced remote teaching in higher education institutions globally. The educational experiences of educators and learners differ in blended learning contexts. What this paper adds Instructors and adult learners' positive experiences with navigating a variety of web-based technologies during the educational process are negatively impacted by technological difficulties during online instruction. Participants' experiences of blended learning are mixed with a preference for face-to-face dimension of blended learning instead of the online dimension. The paper identifies four themes that characterize instructors and adult learners' experiences with technology-enhanced learning including enhanced course delivery and pedagogy, competency development, technological issues and poor-quality pedagogy. Implications for practice and/or policy The study provides evidence-based information on the relevance of digitizing distance education for sustainable development and promotion of lifelong learning opportunities for distance education students. The research recommends that higher education institutions (HEIs) implement agile policies to facilitate a seamless shift to distance learning. HEIs may adopt open distance learning frameworks to streamline 21st century pedagogical and learning practices in distance-blended learning environments for quality course instruction. The study highlights the potential distance learning modalities that HEIs can consider for Distance Education students to sustain effective quality teaching and learning.

TI  - Sustainable development goals and multisectoral collaborations for child health in Cambodia: a qualitative interview study with key child health stakeholders
T2  - BMJ OPEN
LA  - English
KW  - GOVERNANCE
AB  - Objectives Multisectoral collaboration highlighted as key in delivering on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), but still little is known on how to move from rhetoric to action. Cambodia has made remarkable progress on child health over the last decades with multisectoral collaborations being a key success factor. However, it is not known how country stakeholders perceive child health in the context of the SDGs or multisectoral collaborations for child health in Cambodia. Design, settings and participants Through purposive sampling, we conducted semistructured interviews with 29 key child health stakeholders from a range of government and non-governmental organisations in Cambodia. Guided by framework analysis, themes, subthemes and categories were derived. Results We found that the adoption of the SDGs led to increased possibility for action and higher ambitions for child health in Cambodia, while simultaneously establishing child health as a multisectoral issue among key child stakeholders. There seems to be a discrepancy between the desired step-by-step theory of conducting multisectoral collaboration and the real-world complexities including funding and power dynamics that heavily influence the process of collaboration. Identified success factors for multisectoral collaborations included having clear responsibilities, leadership from all and trust among stakeholders while the major obstacle found was lack of sustainable funding. Conclusion The findings from this in-depth multistakeholder study can inform policy-makers and practitioners in other countries on the theoretical and practical process as well as influencing aspects that shape multisectoral collaborations in general and for child health specifically. This is vital if multisectoral collaborations are to be successfully leveraged to accelerate the work towards achieving better child health in the era of the SDGs.

AB  - Systematic and comprehensive understanding of stakeholder relationships is the key component for achieving social sustainability of brownfield regeneration (BR), which has not been recognized by existing researches. Based on the widely acknowledged idea of social networks, this paper proposes a systematic research framework for the analysis of stakeholder relationships, with a focus on the dynamic and networked nature of relationships. The relationship network of stakeholders in BR is considered from three aspects: identifying the stakeholders and relationships among them, quantifying stakeholder relationships, and analyzing relationships network structure. The proposed stakeholder relationships analysis framework uses empirical methods (i.e., interviews and surveys), rationalistic methods (i.e., fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) and social network analysis (SNA)) to analyze stakeholder relationships. To demonstrate the usability of the proposed framework, we apply it to the BR in China. The results show that: (1) it is feasible to mine the relationships of stakeholders from the social network perspective; (2) from the individual network aspect, the government, developers, government are at the core of the network with the highest network centrality during the recycling and contamination treatment stage, the construction stage and the use stage, respectively; (3) from the local network aspect, different cohesive subgroups with strong linkages are formed throughout the life cycle of BR; (4) from the overall network aspect, the highest density of the use stage means that there is good cohesion among stakeholders at this stage; the centralization of the construction stage is the highest, indicating that the stakeholders have relatively concentrated network power and loose relationships. The paper puts forward suggestions for improving the network structure of stakeholder relationships, including strengthening the network relationship between the government and environmental non-government organizations (ENGOs), improving the monitoring efficiency and network status of news media, establishing a construction consulting platform that effectively serves the public and end-users, forming the alliances among end-users, the public and ENGOs and enhancing the relationship network stability. Overall, this study helps to clarify stakeholder relationships by providing a systematic framework to encourage better stakeholder engagement.

AB  - Odour pollution is a well-known problem related to a number of different industrial activities. It is also one of the main causes of citizens' complaints to local authorities. Specific programs are needed to manage persistent odour pollution problems within communities in order to avoid possible socio-environmental conflicts. The H2020 project D-NOSES (Distributed Network for Odour Sensing, Empowerment and Sustainability) aims to help citizens co-create local solutions in collaboration with industries, regional & local authorities, and odour experts. The project will develop an innovative bottom-up approach to odour pollution governance by combining citizen science and stakeholder management methods using a quadruple helix model. The first aim of this article is to introduce the D-NOSES project and its methodology. Aside from that, the article presents an overview of the existing odour impact assessment methods currently available to quantify odour pollution. Finally, the different odour measurement methods are compared in terms of their applicability and limitations. This overview will be made available online as a first step towards the development of the International Odour Observatory, a platform to be created within the D-NOSES project to help promote odour pollution management and resolve regulation issues. The platform will become a global resource on odour issues and also include information about odour abatement systems, chemical substances in odour emissions, and odour regulations around the world.

AB  - The vital role of extensive information exchange among stakeholders across diverse sectors and the interconnection of various scientific fields with nonhomogeneous technology readiness levels has created a new form of a complex engineering problem in the climate change era. Comprehensive sustainability assessment to enable the realization of needs requires transdisciplinary thinking to achieve systematic solutions that bridge the gap between multiple collaborative systems in a portfolio. Although the principal aim of dedicated sustainability regulations is to force companies to move toward sustainability development, general and non-engineered metrics that have not defined clear thresholds for evaluation have encountered severe challenges regarding implementation and economic viability. Therefore, adopting a transdisciplinary systems engineering approach can address multifaceted challenges like sustainability by overcoming collaboration barriers, and traditional disciplinary limits. This paper systematically reviews sustainability-dictated regulations from a transdisciplinary perspective. Different standards are compared, raised opportunities and challenges are discussed, and future remarks are highlighted. The sustainability problem is analyzed from a transdisciplinary systems engineering lens. Finally, a two-level resilient system sustainability assessment framework is proposed to effectively handle and enhance the resilience of companies' sustainability development roadmaps by enabling decision makers to find robust and highly reliable solutions regarding sustainable system design. The impact of this research is to create a new insight into addressing climate change which not only assesses the current situation but also considers uncertainty sources that affect decision making for the future.

AB  - The success of sustainable building renovation is inevitably dependent on the capabilities of the involved stakeholders throughout the entire project. Therefore, any building client with intentions of sustainable building renovations must reflect on sourcing the adequate capabilities for a sustainable renovation project. The question in focus is: how to facilitate a sourcing strategy for energy-efficient sustainable building renovation and maintenance. This study on energy efficiency implementations shows that even in developed countries like Sweden, where energy efficiency is regulated by the EU, national legislation and other public policies, the municipal facilities management organizations need process guidance to navigate in decisions regarding in-house capabilities and collaboration with external service providers. A dialogue tool for the sourcing process, the energy efficiency maturity matrix, is developed to support future sourcing processes for energy-efficient buildings as a prominent part of the broader field of sustainable building renovation and maintenance. The future will show when building clients to a larger extent will embrace sourcing strategies instead of mainly focusing on specific technical improvements. The new International standards for facilities management (ISO18480 series) might support this change process, as it includes a sourcing approach, from a strategic level to an operational level, to add more value and to optimize costs.

AB  - Researchers in multiple, related fields that address complex social and environmental challenges, have shown ongoing enthusiasm for applying transdisciplinary social-ecological systems (SES) research to promote sustainability. However, few studies have evaluated the effectiveness of SES approach, assessed its achievements, and identified challenges to its implementation toward knowledge production for environmental conservation.
   We report the results of a qualitative, participatory evaluation of several SES projects across Europe using an evaluation methodology tailored to transdisciplinary projects. We conducted 66 stakeholder interviews at four designated Long-Term Socio-ecological Research (LTSER) platforms - Danube Delta and Braila Island (Romania); Cairngorms (Scotland); and Donana (Spain). Using qualitative analysis, we synthesized data from interviews and then returned to the sites to present findings to stakeholders in focus group discussions in order to incorporate their feedback into conclusions.
   We conclude that although particular scientists at each platform have taken on entrepreneurial roles to operationalize transdisciplinary science, a business-as-usual attitude tends to dominate institutions, limiting meaningful progress toward transdisciplinary objectives, including: integration of social science research, giving non-researcher stakeholders a more meaningful role in advancing relevant research, and improving knowledge exchange among different stakeholder groups, among other issues. While we found that all the components of transdisciplinary SES research exist at the sites, there is no overarching strategy to link long-term planning and funding, knowledge integration, and priority-setting with stakeholders to ensure the relevance of research for policy and practice. We conclude with reflections about implementing our evaluation methodology, and a call for periodic, participatory evaluation into the future.

AB  - In recent years, fintech has rapidly developed on a global scale, bringing about significant transformations across various industries. Particularly in the energy sector, the potential of fintech to promote corporate green investment has increasingly become a focus. As the energy industry accounts for a significant proportion of global greenhouse gas emissions, guiding companies in implementing green investment has become an important issue for environmental protection and sustainable development. However, previous studies have rarely systematically investigated the influence of fintech on corporate green investment in the energy industry and the mechanisms involved. Hence, this study aims to bridge this research gap within the context of China. By utilizing valid survey data from 466 corporations in the Chinese energy industry and the method of structural equation modeling, the results indicate that: (1) Fintech can promote corporate green investment in the energy industry. (2) Fintech can promote corporate data-driven decision-making capability, information transparency, and sustainable development strategy. (3) Data-driven decision-making capability, information transparency, and sustainable development strategy can also promote corporate green investment in the energy industry. (4) Mediation analysis reveals that data-driven decision-making capability, information transparency, and sustainable development strategy each play a mediating role in the impact of fintech on corporate green investment. (5) Comparative analysis of the mediation effects indicates that there is a certain degree of difference among these three variables' mediating effects, but it did not reach a statistically significant level. This study provides rich insights for business practices, encouraging companies to strengthen their focus on green investment in the fintech era and offer guidance and recommendations to relevant stakeholders, thereby providing practical guidance for corporate green transformation and sustainable development. Finally, this research also contributes to policy development and optimization.

AB  - Ergonomics is a key concern of garment suppliers to improve their workers' well-being and efficiency. However, suppliers' isolated initiatives are not sufficient to improve ergonomics conditions. Thus, buyers' cooperation and collaboration with suppliers are necessary to make the ergonomic initiatives successful and sustainable. The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of buyer-assisted ergonomics intervention on suppliers' performance and the role of buyers' assistance and suppliers' initiatives for improving ergonomics conditions in garment supplier factories. Following a qualitative research approach and multiple embedded case study method, this study intervened in supplier factories and collected qualitative and quantitative data from one Danish buyer and their four key suppliers on ergonomics and the role of buyers and suppliers in improving ergonomics conditions. Collected data were analysed by employing both quantitative and qualitative data analysis techniques. This study demonstrates that buyer-assisted ergonomics intervention on the shop floor can improve ergonomics conditions in garment supplier factories. This study also shows that improving ergonomics in supplier factories need joint efforts of buyers and suppliers. The findings of this study will enrich the literature on ergonomics, sustainability, and buyer-supplier relationships by demonstrating how garment suppliers in developing countries can improve ergonomics to meet the expectations of lead buyers and their workers. This is a unique research attempt to understand ergonomics from a buyer-supplier relationship perspective and its impact on the social sustainability of garment suppliers.

AB  - Behavioral change interventions based on social norms have proven to be a popular and cost-effective way in which both researchers and practitioners attempt to transform behavior in order to increase environmental and social sustainability in real-world contexts. In this paper, we present a systematic review of over 90 empirical studies that have applied behavioral change interventions based on social norms in field settings. Building on previous research about the sources of information that people use to understand social norms and other local determinants of behavior, we propose a framework organized along two axes that describe intervention context (situated interventions applied in the same context where the target behavior happens versus remote interventions that are applied away from that context) and type of normative information leveraged (interventions that provide summary information about a group versus interventions that expose participants to the opinions and behaviors of others). We also illustrate successful applications for each dimension, as well as the social, psychological and physical determinants of behavior that were leveraged to support change. Finally, based on our results, we discuss some of the elements and practical mechanisms that can be used by both researchers and practitioners to design more integral, effective and sustainable social norm intervention in the real world.

AB  - A vital component of achieving climate neutrality in the future involves bolstering energy efficiency measures in educational institutions and improving the overall knowledge on sustainable solutions. To achieve fruitful outcomes, the active involvement of various stakeholders, such as managers, teaching staff, and students, is indispensable. By implementing energy-efficient building systems, advancing the use of renewable energy sources, and incorporating sustainable practices into the curriculum, educational institutions can decrease their environmental impact and conserve resources for future generations. Active participation from all stakeholders, including managers, teaching staff, and students, is essential for the success of these efforts. Providing students with a comprehensive education on sustainability equips them to apply this knowledge in their future professions, thus contributing to a more sustainable society. To gain insights into the existing state of sustainability within educational systems, a comprehensive study of educational institutions was undertaken. To assess and compare schools' sustainability, a composite indicator was developed. The study's findings reveal that the implementation of mandatory and optional measures can lead to a substantial reduction in primary energy consumption by 39% and greenhouse gas emissions by 34% in educational institutions. The average abandonment costs for mandatory measures are 5.87 EUR/kgCO(2)/year, but the average value for optional measures is 33.80 EUR/kgCO(2)/year. It is suggested demonstration projects be implemented in institutions where specialists in RE, mechatronics, building engineering systems, and environmental technologies are trained by showcasing technologies needed for the transition to climate neutrality.

AB  - The contemporary management of social-ecological systems (SES) can frequently be described as 'socially illiterate'. Even if beyond reproach in ecological terms, approaches often fail to achieve effective stakeholder participation. A lack of understanding of the social influences on ecosystems and, even more frequently, of ecosystems on humans and society is the result. Most current interpretations of the social side of social-ecological dynamics are highly context specific but lack a universal core and general applicability. To reverse the degradation of ecosystems and to meet growing human demands for ecosystem services, the assessment of social-ecological dynamics has to conceptualize the social dimension in a theoretically sound and comprehensive manner. Social-ecological analyses which are relevant for decision makers and other practitioners also need to distinguish the local and regional specificities of the social side of human-nature relations in different institutional environments. This contribution examines the reasons that have inhibited a comprehensive treatment of 'the social' dimension of social-ecological (or ecosystem) management and offers a conceptual framework. This framework includes central components of and quality criteria for the social dimension of human-nature relations. After reviewing different approaches to indicator development in social-ecological management, a case study of a mangrove area in a North Brazilian peninsula is presented which combines participatory and system-based approaches to indicator development. A critical evaluation and an outlook conclude this chapter.

AB  - Purpose - This study aims to understand if geographers, who teach in a new sustainability program, are conveying new knowledge, understanding, skills and competence about the integrated and holistic concept of "sustainability", rather than individual human-environmental issues to the students. In other words, are geography professors creating effective sustainability courses in a department with a rich history in geography education?
   Design/methodology/approach - This study utilizes the McKeown-Ice and Dendinger comprehensive assessment tool for sustainability teaching to examine how geographers teach sustainability from an integrated and holistic perspective. Surveys with students are used to evaluate and compare how effective three geography courses were at teaching sustainability.
   Findings - The results suggest that each course was effective in teaching students the main concepts of sustainability. There were, however, differences in teaching practical solutions to achieve sustainability and in the coverage of the causes of sustainability problems. Geographers might consider altering their curriculum or pedagogy to build stronger interdisciplinary linkages to teach the integrated concepts of sustainability rather than its individual parts.
   Research limitations/implications - This initial study focuses on one research university in the USA. Its proof of concept will be expanded to evaluate international sustainability education programs nested in existing departments and degree programs.
   Originality/value - Sustainability education programs are being created across the globe and are often attached to existing degree programs exhibiting components of sustainability. How effective are they in teaching this interdisciplinary concept? This study validates a framework for assessing sustainability teaching and learning. It recommends changes to enhance

AB  - Climate change and sustainable development are interconnected and pressing global challenges requiring urgent attention. Researching the trends in climate change and sustainable development through a bibliometric study is essential for addressing urgent global challenges, identifying gaps in knowledge, informing policy decisions, and promoting collaboration within the academic and research community. This study aims to conduct a bibliometric analysis to investigate the research trends, collaboration network, and thematic evaluation of publications on climate change and sustainable development. 1696 papers from 1992 to 2022 were selected using the PRISMA framework from the Scopus database. We employ Bibliometric R and VOSviewer software to conduct bibliometric analysis. The study found that literature and citations on climate change and sustainable development have grown significantly. The Chinese Academy of Sciences leads in productivity, while the USA, China, and India are the most productive countries. Surprisingly, 44 papers received over 100 citations, while 50% received less than five. Trending topics include COVID-19, urbanisation, attitude, climate change mitigation and adaptation, etc. The evaluation of research themes reveals a shift towards climate change to mitigation, adaptation, and sustainable development goals. The findings serve as a valuable resource for researchers, policymakers, and practitioners, facilitating a deeper understanding of the evolving knowledge of change and sustainable development research and identifying emerging research areas. The shift from a general emphasis on climate change to more specialised themes underscores the necessity for focused examinations within distinct domains, including but not limited to climate change adaptation, mitigation, and the pursuit of sustainable development goals.

AB  - An important aspect of the social sustainability of a proposed solution is acceptance by societal stakeholders. Acceptance is determined by the extent to which the solution matches with stakeholder perspectives on the problem and preferred ways to deal with it. Social learning can contribute to the social sustainability of water management strategies by achieving a convergence in perspectives among societal stakeholders. Serious games have proven to be effective in generating this type of social learning outcomes, but the underlying mechanisms are still unclear. This article aims to clarify how a multi-player serious game on river management (Sustainable Delta) supports social learning among participants with initially diverging perspectives. Based on a conceptual framework for game-based social learning, hypotheses and expectations were formulated and tested with quantitative and qualitative analyses of game sessions. Convergence of perspectives was observed in 10 out of 12 gaming sessions, but could not, or could only to a limited extent, be explained by the presumed learning support mechanisms in the game's design. This underlines the importance of opening up the black box of serious games to determine how and why they work. If this is neglected, there is a clear risk that the design of games will be based on wrong, untested assumptions and will be less effective in supporting social learning and social sustainability.

AB  - The crucial role of customers' positive experience and their subsequent word-of-mouth have been highlighted by both scholars and practitioners for all industry sectors. In response to an increasing concern of environmental sustainability and sensitivity of consumers for deteriorating environment, eco-friendly (green) products and services gained tremendous attention. TripAdvisor is increasingly known as one of the most popular e-tourism platforms. Understanding and predicting the traveler' preferences by advanced big data analytics technology is an important task that the recommendation engine of this platform does. In this paper, we aim to develop a new soft computing method with the aid of machine learning techniques in order to find the best matching eco-friendly hotels based on the several quality factors in TripAdvisor. We develop the method using dimensionality reduction and prediction machine learning techniques to improve the scalability of prediction from the large number of users' ratings. The proposed soft computing method is evaluated on a large dataset discovered from the TripAdvisor platform. The results show that the combination of dimensionality reduction and prediction machine learning techniques is robust in processing the large number of the ratings provided by users on the features of eco-friendly hotels and predicting travelers' choice preferences of eco-friendly hotels in TripAdvisor.

AB  - In recent years, research, society and industry recognize the need to transform the agri-food system towards sustainability. Within this process, sustainability experiments play a crucial role in transforming the structure, culture and practices. In literature, much attention is given to new business models, even if the transformation of conventional firms toward sustainability may offer opportunities to accelerate the transformation. Further acceleration could be achieved through collaboration of multiple actors across the agri-food system, but this calls for a systems approach. Therefore, we developed and applied a new sustainability experiment systems approach (SESA) consisting of an analytical framework that allows a reflective evaluation and cross-case analysis of multi-actor governance networks based on business and learning evaluation criteria. We performed a cross-case analysis of four agri-food sustainability experiments in Flanders to test and validate SESA. Hereby, the key factors of the success of collaboration and its performance were identified at the beginning of a sustainability experiment. Some of the key factors identified were risk sharing and the drivers to participate. We are convinced that these results may be used as an analytical tool for researchers, a tool to support and design new initiatives for policymakers, and a reflective tool for participating actors.

AB  - Universities are expected to play a leading role in developing and maintaining sustainability. To contribute to a systemic and dynamic understanding of organizational change that is necessary in order to play such a role, we comparatively analyzed processes of organizational changes towards sustainability across thirteen universities in Austria. This comparative analysis is based on data from guided interviews and document analysis and on validation of preliminary results via group discussion and individual comments. The results show that all universities embedded sustainability in most of their areas of activity (research, teaching, operations, organizational culture, societal engagement), but the depth of integration and the type of structural embedding varies. Especially for early changes dating back to the 1990s, academics working in the broader field of sustainability studies were those agents of change, who-without formal mandate-skillfully and proactively initiated and drove organizational transformations following an idealistic and intrinsic motivation. A timeline analysis illustrates peaks of sustainability-related changes in the years of the foundation of inter-university networks in 2011 and 2017, which acted as alliances of change. Ministry intervention in 2015 helped to bring sustainability on the agenda of those universities with less change agency. In summary, sustainability transformations across the fields of teaching, research, operations, organizational culture, and societal engagement were driven by a fruitful interplay of change agency and change alliances and to a minor degree by top-down interventions.

AB  - Bridging gaps between educational stakeholders at the classroom, school, and system levels is essential to achieve sustainable change in primary and secondary education. However, transferring knowledge or building capacity within this network of loosely coupled stakeholders is demanding. The brokerage concept holds promise for studying these complex patterns of interaction, as it refers to how specific actors (brokers) link loosely coupled or disconnected individuals (brokering). However, different research traditions, in terms of theoretical frameworks and methodological approaches, and various stakeholders examined in their role as bridge builders make understanding the role of brokers, brokering, and brokerage in changing educational practice challenging. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to provide an overview of the current literature on these concepts in educational change research. In a systematic literature review based on 42 studies, we analyzed each study's theoretical assumptions, methodological approach, scope in terms of stakeholders involved, and empirical findings. First, the literature review revealed that research on educational change refers to four different theoretical frameworks when focusing on brokers, brokering, or brokerage. Second, our results indicate that predominantly qualitative approaches have been applied. Third, using content network graphs, we identified teachers and principals as among the most frequently analyzed brokers. Fourth, four relevant aspects of the empirical findings are presented: brokers' personal characteristics, conditions that enable brokering, successful brokering strategies, and outcomes of brokerage. Finally, we outline a future research agenda based on the empirical evidence base and shortcomings.

AB  - In a globalizing and rapidly-developing world, reliable, sustainable access to water and food are inextricably linked to each other and basic human rights. Achieving security and sustainability in both requires recognition of these linkages, as well as continued innovations in both science and policy. We present case studies of how Earth observations are being used in applications at the nexus of water and food security: crop monitoring in support of G20 global market assessments, water stress early warning for USAID, soil moisture monitoring for USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service, and identifying food security vulnerabilities for climate change assessments for the UN and the UK international development agency. These case studies demonstrate that Earth observations are essential for providing the data and scalability to monitor relevant indicators across space and time, as well as understanding agriculture, the hydrological cycle, and the water-food nexus. The described projects follow the guidelines for co-developing useable knowledge for sustainable development policy. We show how working closely with stakeholders is essential for transforming NASA Earth observations into accurate, timely, and relevant information for water-food nexus decision support. We conclude with recommendations for continued efforts in using Earth observations for addressing the water-food nexus and the need to incorporate the role of energy for improved food and water security assessments.

AB  - Achieving sustainable and climate-proof urban areas has gained considerable attention, focusing on participatory processes in co-designing solutions for urban regeneration. However, these processes often result in general recommendations that risk is ineffective and does not produce tangible outcomes if not integrated into urban plans. Moreover, participatory efforts have overlooked operational industrial areas despite their potential for environmental quality improvement. Thus, unlike many participatory processes that yield general, nonactionable recommendations, this study's unique contribution lies in providing a robust and replicable outcome-oriented methodology that integrates co-designed goals directly into urban planning, ensuring that recommendations translate into concrete, measurable impacts for regenerating operational industrial areas with a view to sustainable development and adaptation to climate change. In addition, this study emphasises the critical role of formal governance and collaboration between enterprises and local governments in transforming and managing industrial sites. Through a detailed, four-phase co-design method evaluated in a real-world setting, this study outlines how stakeholder involvement, material selection and goal-setting can drive actionable urban transformation. The experience emphasised the importance of establishing a rigorous work schedule and helped the enterprises involved by outlining the activities' outcomes and impacts. This study underscores the need for institutional frameworks that foster sustained public-private partnerships, supporting the long-term management and implementation of sustainability initiatives within industrial sites.

AB  - In this study, we analyze the development of key professional skills for sustainability (KPSS) in university students using serious games (SG) from a sustainability perspective. Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were set by the United Nations' 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Universities are strategic agents in the transformation process towards sustainability. Thus, universities should be committed to promoting such skills in their students through sustainable curricula by implementing active methodologies and using SG for that purpose. KPSS are essential for the development of future graduates. The aim of this study is to determine what KPSS have to be developed through the SG "The Island", in order to improve the degree of satisfaction towards the incorporation of a sustainable curriculum among the students. The data were obtained using a questionnaire and then analyzed using linear regression models, with their inferences estimated through a goodness of fit test and ANOVA. The first results indicated that implementation of the SG promoted a strengthening of the students' sustainable curriculum through the development of related skills. It was concluded that the key to success in education for sustainable development is to improve the development of strategic thinking, collaborative thinking, and self-awareness, in addition to encouraging systemic, critical, and problem-solving thinking.

AB  - Organisations are identified as the major anthropogenic sources of climate change, and there are increasing numbers of environmental sustainability initiatives to address the challenge. Their success relies on the active participation of employees through engaging in pro-environmental behaviours (PEBs). Leaders play a crucial role in their responsibility for managing or influencing employees, but research identifies issues of poor leadership, lack of support from leaders, and inability to motivate subordinates as significant barriers to employees' PEBs. Environmental transformational leadership (ETFL) has been identified as the most suitable leadership style for influencing employees' autonomous motivation, and improving PEBs, and there are thus calls to foster or boost leaders' ETFL competencies. This study developed, administered, and evaluated an ETFL training intervention conducted for leaders (managers and supervisors) in two multinational manufacturing companies in the chemical and automobile industries located in China. Nine (9) leaders participated in each company, and their sub-ordinates (chemical company, n = 112; automobile company, n = 104) provided ratings of leaders' ETFL be-haviours, and subordinates' autonomous motivation and PEBs, at pre-and post-training stages. Results show that subordinates' ratings of leaders' ETFL behaviours, and their self-reported autonomous motivation and PEBs, all significantly increased after the intervention, with large effects in the chemical company and above-small effects in the automobile company. This study offers theoretical insights on how leaders' ETFL can be developed or boosted, which is beneficial for influencing improvements in employees' PEBs and promoting organisational environmental sustainability initiatives.

AB  - In situ simulation (ISS) programs deliver patient safety benefits to healthcare systems, however, face many challenges in both implementation and sustainability. Prebriefing is conducted immediately prior to a simulation activity to enhance engagement with the learning activity, but is not sufficient to embed and sustain an ISS program. Longer-term and broader change leadership is required to engage colleagues, secure time and resources, and sustain an in situ simulation program. No framework currently exists to describe this process for ISS programs. This manuscript presents a framework derived from the analysis of three successful ISS program implementations across different hospital systems. We describe eight change leadership steps adapted from Kotter's change management theory, used to sustainably implement the ISS programs analyzed. These steps include the following: (1) identifying goals of key stakeholders, (2) engaging a multi-professional team, (3) creating a shared vision, (4) communicating the vision effectively, (5) energizing participants and enabling program participation, (6) identifying and celebrating early success, (7) closing the loop on early program successes, and (8) embedding simulation in organizational culture and operations. We describe this process as a "longitudinal prebrief," a framework which provides a step-by-step guide to engage colleagues and sustain successful implementation of ISS.

AB  - Technological innovation has a significant role in improving health systems (HSs) and achieving universal health coverage (UHC). The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared resolutions on Health Technology Assessment (HTA) and other global organizations emphasized on HTA systems to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). HTA is a modern multidisciplinary decision-making framework linking knowledge and policymak-ing by assessing the medical, social, economic, organizational, and ethical effects, and/or impacts within health and social systems. The research significance lies in the growing need for HTA at these moments than ever as it is seen as an essential development approach to tackle the current global challenges and pandemics, particularly in developing countries. The research aims to comprehensively evaluate and understand HTA systems concerning the level of knowledge about HTA, current HTA structure, practices, application, capacity, gaps, and solutions. The project starts in January 2021 and ends in January 2022 and will be carried out in seven countries: Canada, Switzerland, Brazil, Lebanon, Jordan, Palestine, and Tanzania. A mixed-methods, quantitative and qualitative, along with a literature review will be applied. In each country, ten HTA-associated institutions will complete an adapted electronic survey, developed by the WHO, and ten key-informants selected purposively from the government, academia, NGOs, and private sectors to participate in ten individual in-depth interviews. One government representative from each country will participate in one expanded inter-country workshop. Excel, IBM Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS), and MAXQDA software programs will be used for data management and analysis. The research will form cutting-edge evidence not only for the seven countries, but also for the global, regional, and national endeavors with regards to opening a room for HTA best application and optimization. It will reveal lessons learned, determine gaps, and build a well-enabled and institutionalized HTA for better UHC, health systems, and multi-sectoral development.

AB  - Purpose Researchers in supply chain transparency have called to expand the boundaries by disclosing various types of information to multiple stakeholders. The purpose of this paper is to explore the effect of transparency about supply chain sustainability on consumers as critical stakeholders and investigate the effectiveness of message characteristics. Design/methodology/approach This study utilizes two scenario-based experiments grounded in a refurbished goods context: Study 1, which employs a 2x2 between-subject experiment investigates the effects of product type and sustainable information provision on consumers evaluations, and Study 2, which employs a 2x1 between-subject experiment examines the effects of sustainable information direction on consumer evaluations. A total of 348 participants were recruited from the Amazon M-Turk platform across the two experiments. Data are analyzed with regression analysis using the PROCESS macro in SPSS and the Johnson-Neyman technique. Findings Contrary to prior research that assumes that refurbished products are associated with lower quality, quality perceptions are moderated by individuals' environmental involvement (EI) and the information presented by the firm. More importantly, consumer evaluations are influenced by specific characteristics of sustainable supply chain messages: high EI individuals have higher willingness-to-pay a premium (WTPP) when the message is consistent with original beliefs (pro-attitudinal). In contrast to prior theory, there was no difference in the WTPP of consumers with high EI and low EI for counter-attitudinal messages. Practical implications - The study shows that what to say, how to say it and to whom, are critical for firms who seek to nudge consumers to support their sustainable practices. Originality/value The value of communicating information on sustainability has been well established. However, little is known about such association when the information provided trades off environmental benefits and product quality. This research addresses the gap in a refurbished product context. The research studies the effect of sustainable supply chain transparency and message characteristics on stakeholders' evaluations.

AB  - There is substantial difficulty with effectively, and meaningfully, engaging the public with community-based sustainability projects as a method to facilitate sustainable lifestyles. Individuals engage with community projects in numerous ways: cognitively (knowledge), affectively (emotions), and behaviourally (actions). One prevalent consideration that individuals consider is other peoples' (lack of) engagement; given that the success of community-based approaches addressing climate change is dependent upon the actions, and participation, of all local residents. Findings from focus groups in seven urban communities in the UK are presented that illustrate clear elements of 'Othering' as part of individual engagements with community-based sustainability projects. Primarily, there is substantial consideration towards what other people within the community know, feel, and do to engage with community-based projects. Residents distinguish themselves in opposition to those they view as engaging, and not engaging, in the same way as themselves and indicate the need for equitable participation amongst all residents. These considerations have the potential to project particular barriers on wider community engagement if left to develop, cause tension, and are not resolved. Implications for participatory strategies to meaningfully and effectively engage individuals with community-based sustainability and transformational change are outlined. Insights into how considerations of 'Othering' can be overcome so as not to cause negative engagements with other residents and attempts to live sustainably as part of a community approach are illustrated.

AB  - A persistent challenge for Australian higher education policymakers and researchers has been to understand why policies and practices have met with limited success in widening the participation and attainment of non-traditional students. This paper explores theorising Narrative Identity as a constructive methodological framework for understanding non-traditional students' experiences in higher education. Using this approach, I critically analyse the contrasting experiences of three non-traditional students who successfully transitioned to university via an enabling program but who had significantly different (and unanticipated) levels of engagement and success in their studies. 'Transformation' emerged as a recurring theme in students' perceptions of becoming academically capable students. Applying a social constructionist lens, I explore the intersections and interactions between discourses of disadvantage and transformation within the context of neoliberal higher education structural discourses. Interview data conveys students' changing values and behaviours, revealed in their rejection of prior 'not capable' identities and performance of their new 'capable student' identity. Students' understandings of self provide insights relevant to the sustainability of their 'capable student' identity and, therefore, the quality of their engagement and success. The paper concludes with a consideration of Australian higher education policy and urges greater consideration of identity challenges faced by non-traditional HE students.

AB  - Scientists have warned decision-makers about the severe consequences of the global environmental crisis since the 1970s. Yet ecological degradation continues and little has been done to address climate change. We investigated early-career conservation researchers' (ECR) perspectives on, and prioritization of, actions furthering sustainability. We conducted a survey (n = 67) and an interactive workshop (n = 35) for ECR attendees of the 5th European Congress of Conservation Biology (2018). Building on these data and discussions, we identified ongoing and forthcoming advances in conservation science. These include increased transdisciplinarity, science communication, advocacy in conservation, and adoption of a transformation-oriented social-ecological systems approach to research. The respondents and participants had diverse perspectives on how to achieve sustainability. Reformist actions were emphasized as paving the way for more radical changes in the economic system and societal values linked to the environment and inequality. Our findings suggest that achieving sustainability requires a strategy that (1) incorporates the multiplicity of people's views, (2) places a greater value on nature, and (3) encourages systemic transformation across political, social, educational, and economic realms on multiple levels. We introduce a framework for ECRs to inspire their research and practice within conservation science to achieve real change in protecting biological diversity.

AB  - In an era of global climate change, intertwined with social and ecological predation, there is growing recognition of the importance of building socially, environmentally, culturally pluralistic, just and sustainable futures. Yet many of the calls for reform and discourses around sustainability are authored and defined through top-down approaches, by those who have power, privilege, and cognitive authority, and excludes the voices, identities, and epistemologies of those in the margins. In this paper we argue for the need to design and develop transformative learning ecologies that explicitly position the diverse voices of youth from nondominant communities as central to re-defining and re-envisioning relationally just, pluralistic, and sustainable futures. To this end, we seek to provide examples from participatory design-based learning ecologies to illustrate the centering of middle school youth voices and agencies from multilingual Black, Brown, and Latinx communities through critical response-ability. These examples highlight how these youth grapple with the uncertain landscapes of sustainability in their communities and provide counter-narratives to traditional deficit-based discourses and youth empowerment. We draw on what we have learned from multilingual youth to offer some suggestions for designing transformative learning ecologies situated within the framework of critical-response-ability in the quest for sustainable, thriving, and just futures.

AB  - In this paper we investigate the collaborative paradigm in Sustainable Supply Chain Management (SSCM). The depth and quality of the relationship between a firm and its suppliers is widely recognised as a critical facilitator of SSCM. Many authors in the field have argued that a collaborative approach to SC relationship management was likely to be more fruitful in achieving sustainable development goals. However, little research has offered a more nuanced perspective on collaborative SSCM and specifically assessed its feasibility outside the context of large companies collaborating on environmental activities. In this paper, we explore collaboration in SSCs through a qualitative study of a large multinational in the food sector working with small agricultural suppliers. We show that there are both supporting and hindering factors to collaborative SSCM. The study reveals the dynamic nature of SC relationships for sustainability and that collaboration can be developed through time thanks to investment in both formal relationship building mechanisms and more relational aspects. The main contributions of the paper lie in its nuanced view of collaboration for SSCM and systematic application of relational theory (Dyer and Singh, 1998) in SSCM. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Keeping in mind the fact that organizations in the region of Vojvodina are moving from a negotiated to market economy, this study aims to analyze how the dimensions of collaborative climate affect the various activities of knowledge management. The degree to which collaborative climate influences knowledge work is investigated on 190 participants in the region of the Province of Vojvodina (Serbia). Two standardized questionnaires were used to collect data: a knowledge management questionnaire, which included 32 questions, and a collaborative climate questionnaire of 20 questions. To test the hypothesis of the study, the technique used was descriptive statistics, confirmatory factor analysis, and structural equation modeling. The results show that only the organizational culture as a dimension of collaborative climate contributes to the explanation of all the activities of knowledge management, except the activity of leaving knowledge, which fails to achieve a statistical relationship with any dimension of collaborative climate. This study provides useful insights for practitioners wanting to improve an organization's performance and to increase organizational sustainability and learning. It is a useful base to expand further research in a way of better understanding the impact that collaborative climate has on the implementation of knowledge management in a transition towards a knowledge economy.

AB  - Parental engagement (PE) in early childhood education refers to the different ways parents get involved to help children's learning. Drawing on Ecological Systems and Social Capital as theoretical frameworks, this research explored parents' engagement experiences in early childhood education in primary schools in Debre Tabor Town, Ethiopia. A qualitative approach with a case study design was employed in this study. Through purposive sampling, 12 key informants, such as parents, school principals and teachers, were chosen from five primary schools for in-depth interviews. Thematic analysis was used to analyse data from interviews focusing on four dimensions of PE: communication, learning at home, collaborative partnership and creating a nurturing environment. Results showed that parents excelled in creating a nurturing home environment to support their children's education. However, the study revealed low engagement from parents in communication, collaborative partnership and learning at home activities. It highlighted that parents' engagement in working with others to help the education of their children was not motivating. Lastly, the study also identified the reasons behind parents' low engagement in early childhood education, many of which are associated with parent-related, and school-related. Generally, the research indicated parents had limited engagement in their child's pre-school education.

AB  - PurposeFacility management (FM) plays an important role in the attainment of a sustainable built environment during the building operational stage since it is responsible for decisions that influence materials' durability, waste, cost reduction and energy efficiency. However, the integration of the life cycle assessment (LCA) approach in FM presents some difficulties in obtaining complete inventories for building components, tracking material flows and defining system boundaries. This paper aims to establish the environmental impact comparison between maintenance actions and replacement interventions performed during the life cycle of a steel frame from a building facade.Design/methodology/approachFor this purpose, the effects of different repair/maintenance actions and end-of-life scenarios were analysed using two tools: an LCA building information modelling-based tool and an LCA open-source tool.FindingsThe results showed that repairing and maintaining the steel structure is essential for the safety and preservation of the steel structure. However, steel maintenance and repair practices that involve fewer environmental impacts need to be explored.Social implicationsIt also emphasises the crucial role of facility managers in promoting sustainability and supporting informed decision-making throughout the building's life cycle, thereby aiding in the pursuit of sustainable development and the goal of decarbonisation by 2050.Originality/valueThis study reveals that maintenance processes in building management have a greater environmental impact compared to material replacement activities, especially concerning the steel structure within the case study building, as assessed using two LCA software tools. The findings provide valuable insights into the environmental impacts of maintenance and replacement phases and underscore the need for further investigation into more sustainable maintenance practices within facility management. Additionally, the study raises public awareness and engagement in environmental responsibility, contributing positively to the achievement of a sustainable built environment.

AB  - In the course of digitalization, new technologies and innovations are continuously introduced to the educational sector. For instance, augmented reality (AR) is increasingly applied in science teaching in both school and higher education. Combining real and virtual content potentially enhances interactivity and understanding of the learning process. This teaching and learning approach can positively impact various learning outcomes, such as learning gains and motivation. This paper aims to investigate the positive learning effects of AR using a game-based AR learning environment: "Beat the Beast". In line with the concept of an education for sustainable development (ESD) topic, microplastics, this learning environment follows an interdisciplinary approach, combining the subjects of biology, chemistry, and engineering. To determine and distinguish the effects of implementing the technology AR in science learning environments as well as the principles of game-based learning, we contrasted the learning environment into two factors: one with AR and one without AR and the other with a game and without a game. A quasi-experimental design with 203 pre-service teachers of the first semester of all subjects was chosen to evaluate the four different types of settings with questionnaires on motivation, technology acceptance, user engagement, cognitive load, computer self-efficacy, knowledge, and ESD outcomes in higher education. Our research demonstrates that although augmented reality (AR) imposes a relatively elevated cognitive load, it does not negatively affect learning effects. In spite of the increased cognitive load, learners in AR settings do not exhibit lesser knowledge acquisition compared to those in alternative environments. Moreover, our investigation highlights AR's potential to amplify motivation and user engagement. Contrary to expectations, in the context of the selected subject matter and target audience, game-based adaptations of the educational environment fail to enhance learning outcomes. These versions actually underperform compared to other formats in both motivational and engagement metrics.

AB  - Aim: To assess sustainability of an intervention used to implement pressure ulcer prevention.
   Background: The Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Service framework was used to develop an intervention aimed to implement evidence-based pressure ulcer prevention in a hospital setting. A short-term follow-up showed that significantly more patients received pressure ulcer prevention. A qualitative process evaluation gave support that the intervention and the implementation process changed the understanding and approach to working with pressure ulcer prevention from treating to preventing.
   Method: The study had a sequential mixed method approach, combining quantitative and qualitative data. For the quantitative data, baseline and short-term follow-up (6-8 months) data reported in an initial study were compared with long-term follow-up (36-42 months) data (n = 259 patients). For the qualitative data, interviews with registered nurses (n = 20), assistant nurses (n = 7) and first-line managers (n = 5) were performed.
   Results: The performance of pressure ulcer prevention was sustained 3 years from its conception. The number of patients with pressure ulcers was reduced (P = 0.021). Systematic work with quality measurements, support from first-line managers, internal facilitation, collaboration and pressure ulcer prevention skills could explained the sustainability. Obstacles to achieve high-quality pressure ulcer prevention were inadequate communication, high workloads and high rates of new and substitute nurses.
   Conclusion: Three different components for sustainability on the micro-level are described; benefits for the patients, the need for routinization and development over time. Threats to sustainability are described as factors on the macro-level. There needs to be collaboration in the healthcare organization from the micro-to-macro levels, and committed experienced nurses are needed to obtain high-quality sustainable pressure ulcer prevention.

AB  - The organisation needs multidisciplinary skills, coordinated efforts, and adequate knowledge in order to implement successful Sustainable Enterprise Resource Planning (S-ERP) systems. Various studies have been conducted on S-ERP system, however, many of which only focused on the empirical analysis and imperative of the system without concerning on the effective implementation of the system. The absence of a validated plan and guide of S-ERP implementation would increase the cost and time of the system implementation and decrease the quality product and service. The recent research contributions have dealt with developing a master plan for the S-ERP system implementation that includes certain components, such as a roadmap, framework, and guidelines. A previous study has highlighted the development of the S-ERP roadmap. To advance the formulation of the S-ERP master plan, this presented study aims to evaluate the usability of the developed roadmap through peer review method. Data collection and analysis are the major actions to be performed in the evaluation. The peer review is performed by twelve experts including academics and practitioners. According to the peer review results, the S-ERP roadmap required to be divided into a sustainable enterprise and sustainable integrated enterprise. The experts verified that the S-ERP roadmap could be generally applied to various types of industry. It can provide a guide for practitioners to implement S-ERP system in organisations. In addition, it provides a theoretical basis for other related studies to comprehend the S-ERP system implementation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The unsustainable nature of prevailing food systems contributes to drive humanity out of a safe operating space. Despite recognising the need for food systems transformation, its direction diverges into different sustainability narratives and conflicting objectives resulting in disjoint policy agendas and problem definitions. While few studies compared and identified gaps and trade-offs in food systems frameworks, systematic reviews for conceptualising sustainable food systems remain scarce. Focusing on the European context, we investigated how academics framed sustainability narratives and their role in advancing Sustainable Development Goals targets, exploring lock-ins and leverage points for food system transformation. By conducting a PRISMA systematic scoping review and analysing 94 documents, we found disparities in current research with socio-economic and cross-cutting aspects comparatively overlooked to environmental and health ones. Linking sustainability objectives to 55 SDG targets we demonstrated their potential contributions to sustainable development by addressing systemic conceptualisations and acknowledging trade-offs. We identified lack of vision and coordination among stakeholders and institutional framework shortcomings as barriers to change. Analysis of leverage points suggested stakeholder engagement and system transparency as pivotal for transformation. Last, we draw concrete implications for science and policy agendas to shape a food systems transformation grounded in a shared sustainability paradigm forged through collaborative efforts among scientific, policy, and societal domains.

AB  - Given the direct dependence rural communities have on forests, understanding ecosystem services can empower communities and align stakeholders to define priorities and objectives for the sustainable management of forest resources. In this qualitative study on the forest ecosystem services in Bhutan, we assessed community awareness and perceptions of local forest ecosystem services, identified their top priorities, and evaluated how they have changed over time. The study focused on state reserve forest areas designated for commercial timber production, formally known as forest management units (FMU). We held focus group discussions separately with women and men associated with five FMUs in the central belt of the country. Participants identified 45 ecosystem services, with soil productivity, freshwater, timber, fresh air, construction stone, carbon sequestration, spiritual value, pollination, and local weather regulation comprising the most highly valued services critical to local livelihood and well-being. Participants felt that forest ecosystem services have been generally declining over the past decade in the FMUs and identified a need for forest restoration activities to improve their delivery. We recommend that state forest entities conduct an awareness campaign to empower communities with the conceptual framework and globally recognized concepts to advocate for their needs related to forests. We also recommend that biophysical and economic studies be conducted in these areas to seek evidence for causal linkages between natural resource use and the status of ecosystem services. This study contributes to a growing literature on ecosystem services in Bhutan and provides a basis for future studies to understand how management activities can impact the delivery of critical services.

AB  - The acknowledgement of uncertainty and complexity in social-ecological systems has increased the implementation of collaborative governance regimes for environmental issues. The performance of these new regimes to deliver favourable social and ecological outcomes must therefore be evaluated. We focus on the case of Swedish wildlife governance, which has a tradition of using collaborative elements. In relation to moose (Alces alces), these collaborative aspects were recently formalized in an amended policy. We aim to assess some aspects of this new regime's performance with respect to intermediate ecological outcomes (i.e. quota fulfilment). We use path analysis to test the causal effects of system context and collaboration dynamics on governance outcomes. Collaboration dynamics were assessed using a web-based survey sent to all stakeholders in Moose Management Groups (response rate = 82 %). Our originally specified model yielded a good fit (SRMR of .030 and robust TLI of .996) and explained 20 % of the variation in outcomes. Context variables revealed significant direct effects on collaboration dynamics and outcomes. Larger Moose Management Areas and fluctuations in forage availability required more time investment from actors, while high land use diversity and density of other ungulate species negatively affected moose quota fulfilment. Moose Management Groups that invested more time and perceived to have a good knowledge base achieved better quota fulfilment. Collaboration dynamics thus had a positive direct effect on outcomes. From a policy perspective, our results raise questions regarding institutional fit because context factors had significant negative effects on collaboration dynamics and the outcomes of the collaborative process.

AB  - Organic Agriculture and Agroecology are production systems considered relevant for building up sustainable food systems at an environmental, social and economic level. In recent years there has been a growing interest in considering which processes can contribute to upscaling these systems. At a global level Agroecological Local Agri-food Systems and Bio-districts are becoming beacons for that purpose. This paper presents a case study of an organic and agroecological group of producers in the Argentinian Pampa Region where we used the Participatory Action Research (PAR) approach in implementing three interconnected methodologies: (i) Sustainability assessment using the FAO Tool for Agroecology Performance Evaluation (TAPE), (ii) Participatory Value chain Development and (iii) Stakeholder Analysis. This was done to verify if the combination of methodologies can be useful to (i) evaluate the current situation of the group in terms of LAFS development and (ii) identify which possible activities would be required for upscaling organic and agroecological practices at a regional level with a neo-endogenous approach. We conclude that the participative assessment implemented was useful to identify the group stage in terms of LAFS development and also to identify the activation requirements for upscaling the system at the same time that the participatory process addressed and organized a set of procedures in the hands of the group for implementing that process.

AB  - Background: Since the introduction of non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) in 2011, mainly by commercial companies, a growing demand for NIPT from the public and healthcare professionals has been putting pressure on the healthcare systems of various countries. This study identifies the challenges of establishing a responsible implementation of NIPT for aneuploidy in prenatal healthcare, by looking at the Netherlands.
   Methods: A mixed methods approach involving 13 stakeholder interviews, document analysis and (participatory) observations of the Dutch NIPT Consortium meetings were used. The Diffusion of Innovation Theory and a Network of Actors model were used to interpret the findings.
   Results: Implementation of NIPT was facilitated by several factors. The set-up of a national NIPT Consortium enabled discussion and collaboration between stakeholders. Moreover, it led to the plan to offer NIPT through a nationwide research setting (TRIDENT studies), which created a learning phase for careful implementation. The Dutch legal context was perceived as a delaying factor, but eventually gave room for the parties involved to organise themselves and their practices.
   Conclusions: This study shows that implementing advanced technologies with profound effects on prenatal care benefit from a learning phase that allows time to carefully evaluate the technical performance and women's experiences and to enable public debate. Such a coordinated learning phase, involving all stakeholders, will stimulate the process of responsible and sustainable implementation.

AB  - Peru has one of the fastest-growing economies in Latin America, but there are concerns regarding how long this can be sustained. Negative environmental impacts are increasing due to the pressures of a growing urban population and competition for natural resources. This study explores stakeholder perceptions linked to nexus governance in the context of integrated management of natural resources, particularly water, and the environmental, socio-economic and governance challenges constraining the achievement of UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Our analysis focused on the urban and rural areas associated with the city of Arequipa, an economically dynamic region subject to extreme levels of water stress. Face-to-face interviews with key informants were conducted to identify mechanisms that have enhanced successful multi-sectoral collaboration, and to assess challenges in promoting sustainable economic development. A workshop prioritised the identified challenges and an online survey was then used to assess stakeholder interest in and influence over nexus governance of water with other natural resources. Stakeholder mapping revealed a complex network of actors involved in nexus governance, where successful collaboration could be promoted through formal and informal mechanisms, including exemplar policies and initiatives across sectors and actors. Shared visions between stakeholders were identified as well as contradictory priorities relating to the sustainable management of natural resources. A key finding that emerged was the need to promote adaptation in water and land management (SDG 6) due to perceived impacts of extreme climate events (SDG 13), urban population growth (SDG 11), and increased sectoral water demands. This situation in combination with poor governance and lack of planning has exposed the vulnerability of Arequipa water supply system to future shocks. Urgent action will be needed to raise stakeholder awareness, strengthen governance and enforcement, and agree on a collective vision for integrated land and water planning if the SDGs are to be achieved.

AB  - Agriculture, environment, industry, and millions of households in the western US and northern Mexico depend on the Colorado River, which is facing increasing water shortages due to climate change and rising demand. Collaborative governance will likely be key to solving allocation issues and achieving sustainable water use but has recently faced multiple challenges. This research integrates concepts from institutional, adaptive governance, and bargaining theories to analyze barriers and facilitators to collaborative governance in the drought contingency plan (DCP) process for the lower Colorado River basin from an Arizona stakeholder's perspective. The DCP is ultimately an effort to create a set of rules to prevent and address shortages in the basin. Through a content analysis of public meetings of the Central Arizona Project's governing board, we find a collective DCP or future related policy may be possible. But barriers to collaborative governance have intensified over time, hindering the process and making an agreement increasingly unlikely. The process is a perfect example of the interplay between rules and norms, and the issues that arise when norms underlying rules are interpreted differently. Our analysis provides insights for the design of collaborative water governance, including that conducting an analysis of power dynamics among the stakeholders would advance the DCP process. We ultimately argue that the Colorado River basin would benefit from a transition towards adaptive governance, and that our recommendations to improve collaboration are an important initial step. Additionally, our results reveal areas that require more empirical research, including understanding how to prepare for policy windows, rapid trust building among stakeholders, and theory building related to equity and marginalization in collaborative governance processes.

AB  - Fostering successful interprofessional collaboration remains a challenge in pediatric rehabilitation. A coaching approach can enhance client-centered care and provide a transdisciplinary framework for collaboration. The purpose of this longitudinal study was to evaluate the impact of Solution-Focused Coaching in Pediatric Rehabilitation (SFC-peds) training on pediatric rehabilitation practitioners from multiple disciplinary backgrounds. Thirty-seven service providers (SPs) completed surveys at baseline and three follow-ups. Quantitative and qualitative findings both suggested that the training proved an effective way to achieve substantial and sustainable improvements in SFC knowledge, confidence, and use of SFC-peds techniques among participating SPs. The educational intervention also facilitated the integration of a strengths-based, solution-building approach at an individual and team level, providing SPs with a common language and shared framework for client-centered care and optimal collaboration with colleagues. A need for practice opportunities tailored to unique care contexts was identified. Future research should further explore the impacts of a SFC-peds approach on interprofessional teams, as well as on health outcomes of clients.

AB  - The issue of how to achieve removal of recently accumulated sediment is one of the largest unresolved puzzles in China's lower Yellow River. In this work, the feasibility and sustainability of achieving full-stream erosion in the lower Yellow River based on a water-sediment regulation scheme (WSRS) have been comprehensively investi-gated. The results indicate that the erosion-deposition state of the lower Yellow River is controlled by the incom-ing flow discharge level and the corresponding sediment concentration. The year 1987 is identified as an abrupt change point for streamflow in Xiaolangdi station. The relationships between channel erosion or deposition and the sediment concentration of the incoming discharge are constructed for the periods 1960-1987 and 1988-2017. Based on a constrained optimization approach, a sediment concentration lower than 19.96 kg/m(3) in the discharge from Xiaolangdi Reservoir is determined to be the critical controlling condition for achieving full-stream erosion in the lower Yellow River under the average discharge level observed during 1960-1987; however, it is challenging to achieve full-stream erosion under the average discharge level of 1988-2017. Al-though this erosion status could potentially be achieved through continued implementation of the WSRS, its sus-tainability is restricted by the declining storage capacity of Xiaolangdi Reservoir, decreasing water discharge levels and riverbed coarsening in the Yellow River. It is necessary to design cross-basin collaboration measures for the upper, middle and lower Yellow River to achieve sustainable sediment reduction and healthy develop-ment of the Yellow River basin as a whole.

AB  - This editorial essay introduces the 27 papers included in the special issue proposed by the SDG Academy of the U. N. Sustainable Development Network on the nature, extent, and challenges to progress towards SDG 4: Quality Education for All at the mid -point of the 2030 campaign. Problematic paradigms, and potential pathways towards achieving Sustainable Development Goal 4. With contributrions from leading scholars and practitioners working in the areas of global governance, international development education, and comparative education, this special issue reflects on how far the world has come, provides clarity on what the fundamental obstacles to progress have been, and offers suggestions for ways forward, in addition to raising issues and posing (at times, uncomfortable) questions with which stakeholders should grapple as they work towards SDG 4-and future global goals. The commentaries are focused on five inter -connected themes. These themes relate not only to progress on SDG 4 but also to the key conditions (capacity), processes (measurement), and contexts (e.g. vulnerable contexts) that are relevant to debates about how to make progress on SDG 4, or whether a different approach (geo-political and/or onto-epistemic in nature) is necessary. This essay concludes by encouraging the reader to decide for themselves which arguments they see as being more persuasive. We wouldencourage readers to reflect on why one argument or line of reasoning may resonate more or less-and to consider what the cause of that resonance could be. It is suggested that each reader, each of us, also has work to do when it comes to reflecting on the positions that we take or favor, why, and which voices or perspectives are left out by our answers to these questions. As the contributions to this special issue suggest, there are no easy answers.

AB  - The world has undergone a remarkable transformation from the era of famines to an age of global food production that caters to an exponentially growing population. This transformation has been made possible by significant agricultural revolutions, marked by the intensification of agriculture through the infusion of mechanical, industrial, and economic inputs. However, this rapid advancement in agriculture has also brought about the proliferation of agricultural inputs such as pesticides, fertilizers, and irrigation, which have given rise to long-term environmental crises. Over the past two decades, we have witnessed a concerning plateau in crop production, the loss of arable land, and dramatic shifts in climatic conditions. These challenges have underscored the urgent need to protect our global commons, particularly the environment, through a participatory approach that involves countries worldwide, regardless of their developmental status. To achieve the goal of sustainability in agriculture, it is imperative to adopt multidisciplinary approaches that integrate fields such as biology, engineering, chemistry, economics, and community development. One noteworthy initiative in this regard is Zero Budget Natural Farming, which highlights the significance of leveraging the synergistic effects of both plant and animal products to enhance crop establishment, build soil fertility, and promote the proliferation of beneficial microorganisms. The ultimate aim is to create self-sustainable agro-ecosystems. This review advocates for the incorporation of biotechnological tools in natural farming to expedite the dynamism of such systems in an eco-friendly manner. By harnessing the power of biotechnology, we can increase the productivity of agro-ecology and generate abundant supplies of food, feed, fiber, and nutraceuticals to meet the needs of our ever-expanding global population.

AB  - Coastal vegetation has been widely recognized as a natural method to reduce the energy of tsunami waves. However, a vegetation barrier cannot completely stop a tsunami, and its effectiveness depends on the magnitude of the tsunami as well as the structure of the vegetation. For coastal rehabilitation, optimal planning of natural coastal systems, and their maintenance, we need to quantitatively elucidate the capacity of vegetation to reduce the energy of tsunami waves. The limitations of coastal forests in relation to the magnitude of a tsunami and the maintenance of forests as natural disaster buffer zones have to be understood correctly for effective coastal vegetation planning. Demerits of coastal forests have also been revealed: for example, an open gap in a forest (i.e., a road, river, difference in elevation, etc.) can channel and amplify a strong current by forcing it into the gap. Floating debris from broken trees also can damage surrounding buildings and hurt people. However, many studies have revealed that these demerits can be overcome with proper planning and management of mangroves and coastal forests, and that coastal vegetation has a significant potential to mitigate damage in constructed areas and save human lives by acting as buffer zones during extreme natural events. However, mangrove forests have been damaged by anthropogenic activities (i.e., tourism, shrimp farming, and industrial development), making coastal areas increasingly vulnerable to tsunamis and other natural disasters. The effectiveness of vegetation also changes with the age and structure of the forest. This highlights the fact that proper planning and management of vegetation are required to maintain the tsunami buffering function of coastal forests. Although many government and nongovernmental organizations have implemented coastal vegetation projects, many of them have been unsuccessful due to a lack of proper maintenance. A pilot project in Matara City, Sri Lanka, revealed that participation and support from local authorities and communities is essential to make the planting projects successful. An integrated coastal vegetation management system that includes utilization of the materials produced by the forest and a community participation and awareness program are proposed to achieve a sustainable and long-lasting vegetation bioshield.

AB  - An increasing number of electric vehicle batteries will reach the end of their life cycle with the fast growth of electric vehicles. Since the recycling of retired electric vehicles batteries is of great significance in the light of resource utilization, ecological protection, energy saving and economic benefits, the proper management of electric vehicle battery recycling (EVBR) is crucial for achieving sustainable development. However, due to the involvement of multiple stakeholders, there are many potential barriers in the process of EVBR, and analyzing these barriers can significantly help the recycling management of waste electric vehicle batteries towards a circular economy. Although the literature has focused on analyzing obstacles to implementing reverse logistics for electric vehicle lithium battery recycling from a manufacturer's perspective, less attention has been paid to analyzing barriers to EVBR from a multi-stakeholder perspective. This paper thus aims to investigate the barriers to EVBR from a multi-stakeholder point of view, identify the main barriers affecting battery recycling, and analyze the interrelationships and hierarchies between these barriers. Based on expert opinions and literature reviews, this paper identifies twenty major barriers to EVBR and uses interpretive structural modelling (ISM) method to determine the interrelationships and hierarchies between the barriers, and finally classifies the barriers to EVBR into a seven-level structural model. Furthermore, matriced impacts corises-multiplcation appliance classement (MICMAC) analysis is applied to categorize the identified barriers to EVBR, and the twenty barriers are finally classified into three categories, namely dependent barriers, linkage barriers, and driver barriers. This paper discusses theoretical insights, managerial and practical implications, and measures to overcome EVBR barriers based on the results, which show that the lack of more appropriate incentives is a major barrier to EVBR implementation. This paper provides a solid theoretical foundation for the further development of battery recycling policies, and will also help relevant stakeholders and governments to better understand these barriers and adopt effective approaches to address them.

AB  - PurposeThis study aims to assess the readiness of both citizens and the government for digital participatory planning (DDP) as a contribution to the undergoing transformative shift toward smart and sustainable cities to address the challenges posed by rapid urbanization. While much attention has been devoted to leveraging technology to mitigate these challenges, there has been a relative lack of emphasis on engaging stakeholders in the planning process in a smart and inclusive manner. DPP stands as a cornerstone for the development of sustainable and smart cities. However, before DPP can be effectively implemented on the ground, it is crucial to assess the city readiness for DPP to ensure its success. This assessment is undertaken as part of Oman's broader initiative to transition into sustainable smart cities in alignment with the goals outlined in Oman Vision 2040.Design/methodology/approachA generic evaluation framework was identified, validated and customized to the local context by experts using the pile sorting technique based on the social constructivism theory. Then, the revised framework was used to evaluate the readiness of a sample of local citizens and government officials in Oman for the DPP concept.FindingsThe inferential statistical analysis revealed that citizens are willing to participate in DPP when trust and transparency with policymakers are enhanced. On the government side, the results showed that there is adequate infrastructure that can enable DPP, and planners have a positive attitude toward DPP provided that trust in citizens' opinions is strengthened. This study concludes with a roadmap for preparation for DPP implementation in smart sustainable cities mandated by Oman Vision 2040. The findings and roadmap can inform policy development, decision-making and urban planning practices toward more inclusive, participatory and technologically enabled urban environments.Originality/valueThe study contributes to the existing body of knowledge by emphasizing the significance of stakeholders' smart involvement in planning processes, social sustainability, evaluating city readiness for DPP and providing practical recommendations for DPP implementation in the context of smart sustainable cities. At a theoretical level, the study contributes a framework for assessing readiness for DPP and emphasizes that mutual trust is not only important for conventional participation practices but it is also essential for smart citizens. This study argues that a building or a city is not sustainable unless it is seen as such by its stakeholders, including the end users. Therefore, effective and smart involvement of the citizens in smart city planning is a precondition for the success of the future cities.

AB  - Natural resources management in general, and water resources management in particular, are currently undergoing a major paradigm shift. Management practices have largely been developed and implemented by experts using technical means based on designing systems that can be predicted and controlled. In recent years, stakeholder involvement has gained increasing importance. Collaborative governance is considered to be more appropriate for integrated and adaptive management regimes needed to cope with the complexity of social-ecological systems. The paper presents a concept for social learning and collaborative governance developed in the European project HarmoniCOP ( Harmonizing COllaborative Planning). The concept is rooted in the more interpretive strands of the social sciences emphasizing the context dependence of knowledge. The role of frames and boundary management in processes of learning at different levels and time scales is investigated. The foundation of social learning as investigated in the HarmoniCOP project is multiparty collaboration processes that are perceived to be the nuclei of learning processes. Such processes take place in networks or "communities of practice" and are influenced by the governance structure in which they are embedded. Requirements for social learning include institutional settings that guarantee some degree of stability and certainty without being rigid and inflexible. Our analyses, which are based on conceptual considerations and empirical insights, suggest that the development of such institutional settings involves continued processes of social learning. In these processes, stakeholders at different scales are connected in flexible networks that allow them to develop the capacity and trust they need to collaborate in a wide range of formal and informal relationships ranging from formal legal structures and contracts to informal, voluntary agreements.

AB  - The global food system provides numerous benefits to humanity but also faces critical sustainability challenges with respective costs often burdened by society. As these costs are not sufficiently represented in market prices, increasing monetization efforts of externalities aim to reveal such hidden costs. However, monetary evaluation approaches have limitations such as conformity or including arguably unmonetizable impacts. Given that food production and consumption have been deeply embedded in human culture and behavior throughout millennia, systemic change is generally slow and precarious to enforce externally, especially given its existential role for daily survival. Rather than imposing relatively recent sustainability challenges, such as climate change, onto food systems, we hence suggest incorporating them into a core natural driver of human behavior: values. The objective of this research is to create a framework that can holistically address values associated with food in order to guide and unite stakeholders along the food value chain. Based on this human-centered bottom-up approach, empirical relevance of a respective framework to successfully translate into and guide sustainability efforts should be increased. We therefore combined established approaches of monetary accounting with a psychosocial perspective on basic human values and ethics to derive the Food Value Framework (FVF). We conclude that the FVF could address shortcomings of current evaluation methods and serve as a common foundation to empower transdisciplinary research, value-based policymaking, transparent production, and responsible consumption across the food value chain.

AB  - Emerging economies, e.g. India, China and Brazil etc., face challenges to adopt food safety (FS) practices in their food supply chains. Considering food industry's operations and processes, this study identifies 25 challenges to the FS initiatives involving the opinions of practitioners from six major Indian food producers and academic experts. The challenges are grouped into five categories, viz. organisational, government and policy, global, knowledge and financial. We identify the best and worst challenges to the FS initiatives along with causality among them using combined Best Worst Method (BWM) and 'Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory' (DEMATEL) approaches. BWM prioritises these challenges, while DEMATEL identifies causal relationship maps for the prioritised challenges. The BWM results demonstrate that the government and policy related challenges are the key challenges followed by the organisational, global, knowledge and financial related challenges. The DEMATEL results exhibit the organisational, government and policy, and global related challenges as the cause group challenges. The knowledge and financial related challenges represent the effect group challenges. Mitigation of these challenges inherently necessitates stakeholders' involvement in the food supply chains. We identify constructs for food safety initiatives policy in the emerging economies to raise public awareness while encouraging greater collaboration and efficiency in food supply chains to help achieve the second Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) for securing food for everyone. The results of the study offer guidance and deeper insights to supply chain managers about synergy requirements between the government policymakers and key players of the industry in the emerging economies.

AB  - Integrating a sustainability approach into project management is critical to achieving a successful project. An integrated sustainability approach to public housing (PH) projects will provide a more satisfactory built environment. However, many challenges confront such an approach, for instance, the multi-disciplinary nature of sustainable public housing (SPH) and the lack of an established integrated framework in the literature. This analysis addresses this gap and develops the integrated conceptual framework for SPH. The study methodology combines the results of previous research with a systematic literature review. Three dimensions have been identified to form the integrated SPH framework: requirements, challenges, and opportunities covering all the project stages (scope, planning, design, construction, occupancy, and demolition). The SPH requirement defines the general needs and values needed to achieve sustainability in PH projects in a sustainable community. In contrast, the specific needs are related to end-users' needs. The challenges include the constraints and conditions facing the development of SPH. The opportunities to achieve SPH are discussed based on the construction management tools, including feasibility studies (FS), innovation (INN), risk management (RM), and lean construction (LC). The study reveals increased attention in academic publications toward applying construction management tools in the SPH frameworks: 31% each for the FS and RM, 24% for the INN, and 14% for LC. The study recommends applying this framework as a guideline at the project initiation to ensure a sustainability approach and successful SPH projects. The study also suggests obtaining all stakeholders' feedback regarding existing SPH and consent for new ones to achieve a satisfactory project at the project initiation.

AB  - Effective knowledge exchange at science-policy interfaces (SPIs) can foster evidence-informed policy-making through the integration of a wide range of knowledge inputs. This is especially crucial for conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity and ecosystem services (ES), human well-being and sustainable development. Early-career researchers (ECRs) can contribute significantly to knowledge exchange at SPIs. Recognizing that, several capacity building programs focused on sustainability have been introduced recently. However, little is known about the experiences and perceptions of ECRs in relation to SPIs. Our study focused on SPI engagement of ECRs who conduct research on biodiversity and ES, as perceived and experienced. Specifically, we addressed 'motivations', 'barriers' and 'opportunities and 'benefits'. A total of 145 ECRs have completed the survey. Our results showed that ECRs were generally interested to engage in SPIs and believed it to be beneficial in terms of contributing to societal change, understanding policy processes and career development. Respondents perceived lack of understanding about involvement channels, engagement opportunities, funding, training, perceived credibility of ECRs by other actors and encouragement of senior colleagues as barriers to engaging in SPIs. Those who have already participated in SPIs generally saw fewer barriers and more opportunities. A key reason for dissatisfaction with experience in SPIs was a lack of impact and uptake of science-policy outputs by policymakers - an issue that likely extends beyond ECRs and implies the need for transformations in knowledge exchange within SPIs. In conclusion, based on insights from our survey, we outline several opportunities for increased and better facilitation of ECR engagement in SPIs.

AB  - The use of social media (SM) platforms in higher education has seen significant growth since the global pandemic disrupted traditional learning methods and forced stakeholders to explore alternatives. This trend is expected to continue with the rise of newer digital learning platforms, tools, programs and pedagogies, particularly within the context of the Fourth Industrial Revolution and the evolution towards Education 4.0 and Education 5.0. Despite a significant level of research into SM's role in informal learning, there has been limited exploration of its integration into pedagogical practices, particularly regarding assessment challenges and innovations in university settings. Additionally, there is scarce research on mobile applications in academics, hindering the effective integration of SM platforms into curricula. This study addresses these gaps by examining stakeholder perceptions of using SM for educational purposes in a university setting in Qatar. Following a comprehensive and comparative literature review and analysis, a thematic analysis of interviews with 20 stakeholders revealed that SM platforms go beyond communication, serving as tools to enhance professional identity, reputation, research profiles, knowledge dissemination, and social practices, but they lack methodologies to integrate effective learning, either independently or in formal learning/teaching/assessment settings. This study proposes a framework to optimize the use of SM platforms, with a particular focus on sustainability, for lifelong learning and knowledge-based societies leading to more sustainable and prosperous economies. The findings encourage the reconsideration of digital assessment and the expansion pedagogical practices in alignment with modern social learning through an expansive array of SM tools and platforms.

AB  - The pursuit of carbon neutrality is reshaping global energy systems, making the transition to renewable energy critical for mitigating climate change. However, unstable weather conditions continue to challenge energy consumption stability and grid reliability. This study investigates the effectiveness of various machine learning (ML) models at predicting energy consumption differences and employs the SHapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) interpretability tool to quantify the influence of key weather variables, using five years of data (2017-2022) and 196,776 observations collected across Europe. The dataset consists of hourly weather and energy consumption records, and key variables such as Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI), sunlight duration, day length, cloud cover, and humidity are identified as critical predictors. The results demonstrate that the Random Forest (RF) model achieves the highest accuracy and stability (R2 = 0.92, RMSE = 360.17, MAE = 208.84), outperforming other models in predicting energy consumption differences. Through SHAP analysis, this study demonstrates the profound influence of GHI, which exhibits a correlation coefficient of 0.88 with energy consumption variance. Incorporating advanced data preprocessing and predictor selection techniques remains the RMSE of RF but reduces the RMSE by approximately 25% for the XGBoost model, underlining the importance of selecting appropriate input variables. Hyperparameter tuning further enhances model performance, particularly for less robust algorithms prone to overfitting. The study reveals the complex seasonal and regional effects of weather conditions on energy demands. These findings underscore the effectiveness of ML models at addressing the challenges of complex energy systems and provide valuable insights for policymakers and practitioners to optimize energy management strategies, integrate renewable energy sources, and achieve sustainable development objectives.

AB  - Post-Normal Science (PNS) emphasises the need for scientists and policy-makers to iteratively co-analyse and learn together, as part of an extended peer community. However, the roles and implications for scientific experts when interacting with policy-makers are not well understood. Informed by insights from science and technology studies (STS) on modalities of interaction and the multiple potential roles of experts, we reflect on our experiences as scientific experts working on European agricultural policy within the interdisciplinary H2020 MAGIC project. We aimed to analyse and facilitate science-policy dialogue on a variety of European sustainability challenges. Whilst we achieved stimulating interactions on the nexus of issues associated with sustainable agriculture, our experiences did not fully match our deliberative vision. In part this was due to the varied constraints and reactions of policy-makers: many had limited remit for engagement, some expressed scientists should act as 'fact' providers in support of current tasks; others contested scientific analyses when these implied policy approaches were insufficient. Our own roles and reactions also varied across the scientific team and over time: from attempting to foster relationships, to emphasising our relevance to their tasks, or making stronger judgements. This dynamic mix was at times personally uncomfortable and challenging. Navigating such processes needs explicit reflection on the potentially plural roles expected of scientific and other experts working on and for sustainability. Meanwhile, the persistent expectations and institutional constraints that underlie and constrain science-policy interactions need more recognition, including by policy institutions themselves.

AB  - The role of ICT solutions in protecting the environment, strengthening global efforts to combat climate change, and promoting sustainability has received significant global attention. Various strategies, such as top-down, bottom-up, or blended approaches involving policies and civic actions, have been employed to raise awareness and foster sustainable behavioral changes. However, the relationship between ICT and engagement approaches for promoting awareness and empowering communities and organizations to adopt sustainable practices remains underexplored. This paper presents a systematic mapping study (SMS) that examines the nexus between ICT solutions and engagement approaches, aiming to support citizens' transition to a more sustainable society. The study analyzed 66 relevant primary studies addressing sustainable activities, engagement approaches, and ICT solutions to promote and strengthen awareness of sustainable behavior and activities. The results indicate a growing interest among researchers in ICT-driven engagement approaches for sustainable choices. The study highlights the need for a blended approach that encompasses techno-social strategies to stimulate awareness of sustainable activities and practices at both individual and societal levels. Furthermore, there is a need for future research on the roles of policies, civic actions, and implementation framing, such as green identity, eco-subsidies, and green taxes, for effective strategies to design sustainability-centric technological solutions to foster citizen sustainability awareness and adoption of sustainable practices. These findings contribute to the expanding body of research on ICT for sustainability and hold implications for policymakers, citizens, and organizations committed to a sustainable future.

AB  - Currently, health professionals are inadequately prepared to meet the challenges that climate change and environmental degradation pose to health systems. Health professions' education (HPE) has an ethical responsibility to address this and must include the health effects of climate change and environmental sustainability across all curricula. As there is a narrow, closing window in which to take action to avoid the worst health outcomes from climate change, urgent, systematic, system-level change is required by the education sector. Measuring, monitoring, and reporting activity using indicators have been demonstrated to support change by providing a focus for action. A review of the literature on the use of indicators in medical education for climate change and health, however, yielded no publications. The framework of targets and indicators developed for implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030 and the UNESCO initiative of the Education for Sustainable Development provide a guide for the development of indicators for HPE. Engaging stakeholders and achieving consensus on an approach to indicator development is essential and, where they exist, accreditation standards may have a supporting role. Creating capacity for environmentally sustainable health care at scale and pace should be our collective goal as health professions' educators.

AB  - Companies play a central role in the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs); as such, they face institutional pressures to increase their engagement with SDGs. However, given the complexity of SDGs, it is unclear whether these pressures lead firms to adopt engagement approaches that address a few goals or the whole set of 17, and if that choice has any subsequent effect on financial performance. To shed light on these issues, this research draws on the neo-institutional theory to investigate whether two institutional determinants-industry type and country of origin-affect SDG engagement and whether such engagement improves financial performance. Based on a content analysis and a regression analysis on high-reputation companies (the 100 most sustainable firms in the world) over the period 2017-2020, we find that the institutional pressures associated with industry type and country-of-origin positively impact any engagement approach to SDGs. However, we establish that companies' financial performance only generally improves when engaging with either the whole set of SDGs or a specific subset of the most frequently cited. This study provides important theoretical and practical contributions that illuminate firms' institutional and financial rationales for adopting SDGs.

AB  - The complexity of the supply chain, with a multiplicity of suppliers and organizations imposes challenges to its traceability, affecting the possibility of making it more sustainable. The declaration of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) by companies has been a response to pressures from stakeholders and regulations towards a sustainable supply chain management (SSCM). However, there are still some setbacks. The verification process of the inventories is a time-consuming task and the utilization of traditional renewable energy certificates can cause distortions in the perception of those who are consuming renewable energy but are not buying certificates. A blockchain-based application could address those problems by tracking transparent records of product history. Therefore, we propose a blockchain-based artifact in the form of a level 1 architecture diagram to improve the Brazil GHG Protocol Program inventory process on scope 2, which includes indirect carbon emissions from consumption of purchased electricity, heat or steam; main supply chain components. Using the Design Science Research (DSR) approach, we combine knowledge from business participants and environmental experts to understand the Program problems, propose and evaluate the artifact, and analyze its contributions. We find out that not all actors may want greater transparency in the supply chain and that traditional certificate issuers are expected to resist, while a new generation of blockchain-based certificates challenges the more traditional competitors. Additionally, the economic benefits observed in implementing blockchain points out that the organization and resistance of the actors, therefore, could be as important as costs in the implementation of new technologies in supply chains. There are two main contributions from this study. First, it introduces the discussion on blockchain adoption in the GHG Protocol Program. Second, it uses DSR as an instrument to both articulate a solution around a theoretical artifact and make its potential contribution understandable for actors not familiar with blockchain technologies. We propose that future studies could: (i) produce a proof-of-concept or a pilot implementation of this artifact; (ii) include other actors from the energy and trading certificates chain on the artifact, such as energy producers, regulators and the Brazilian Electricity Trading Chamber (CCEE); (iii) reproduce the same proposition focusing on GHG Protocol's scope 3.

AB  - Purpose The purpose is to analyse the relationship between democratic accountability and how sustainable governance is achieved by horizontally integrating care services for older people through collaboration in a coordination body of key leaders from across the health and social care system. Design/methodology/approach The data and measures come from two surveys with coordination body members in Sweden (politicians, administrators, professionals) from a sample of 73 bodies in 2015 (n = 549) and the same/corresponding 59 bodies in 2019 (n = 389). Findings The governance of integrating care scale and the accountability scales repeatedly show consistency among individual members. Systematic progress is found among large coordination bodies: the greater the average perception of governance of horizontally integrating care in 2015, the greater it was in 2019 - and regardless of the period, the stronger the internal administrative or political monitoring and reviewing of the coordination body, the greater its governance (while the relationship to the external monitoring and reviewing is weak). However, the growing importance of external accountability is indirect, shown by stronger correlations between the internal political and external monitoring and reviewing, regardless of size. Research limitations/implications The scales are based on self-reported perceptions that cannot be objectively verified, but they can be linked to changes in outcomes and user experiences in the later stages of the research. Originality/value Repeatedly verified scales of internal and external accountability for analysing and evaluating governance of integrating care services horizontally, which is useful for improving strategic coordination of integrated care.

AB  - Transdisciplinary research (TDR) aims at identifying implementable solutions to difficult sustainability problems and at fostering social learning. It requires a well-managed collaboration among multidisciplinary scientists and multisectoral stakeholders. Performing TDR is challenging, particularly for foreign researchers working in countries with different institutional and socio-cultural conditions. There is a need to synthesize and share experience among researchers as well as practitioners regarding how TDR can be conducted under specific contexts. In this paper, we aim to evaluate and synthesize our unique experience in conducting TDR projects in Asia. We applied guiding principles of TDR to conduct a formative evaluation of four consortium projects on sustainable land and water management in China, the Philippines, and Vietnam. In all projects, local political conditions restricted the set of stakeholders that could be involved in the research processes. The set of involved stakeholders was also affected by the fact that stakeholders in most cases only participate if they belong to the personal network of the project leaders. Language barriers hampered effective communication between foreign researchers and stakeholders in all projects and thus knowledge integration. The TDR approach and its specific methods were adapted to respond to the specific cultural, social, and political conditions in the research areas, also with the aim to promote trust and interest of the stakeholders throughout the project. Additionally, various measures were implemented to promote collaboration among disciplinary scientists. Based on lessons learned, we provide specific recommendations for the design and implementation of TDR projects in particular in Asia.

AB  - According to many policy makers and scientists, citizen-led initiatives such as community renewable energy initiatives, have the potential to contribute to the transformation towards a sustainable and carbon neutral society. Citizens can co-produce public services together, such as clean energy provision for themselves and their communities. Despite this proclaimed potential, actual citizen engagement in climate action is still low. Moreover, there is a limited holistic and systematic understanding of what drives citizens to jointly co-produce a climate service, as relevant insights are scattered over different bodies of literature. This article contributes to filling this knowledge gap by proposing a novel, comprehensive framework with which the individual conditions under which citizens are willing, able and feel responsible to co-produce a climate service can be systematically explored. This so-called motivation-capacity-ownership (MCO) framework integrates eight relevant conditions under three dimensions: Motivational, capacity-related, and ownership-related conditions. Based on a literature review, the eight conditions are elaborated upon for community renewable energy initiatives. It is argued that all eight conditions matter, but that their weight may vary depending on the different policy and institutional contexts, and that therefore different combinations of the eight conditions may determine whether a citizen participates in an initiative. Researchers are invited to test the validity of the framework for different types of community renewable energy initiatives in different institutional and geographical contexts, for which a research approach is proposed. In light of the rise of citizen initiatives for all kinds of sustainability issues, the framework could also be tested for enhancing its validity and refinement for citizen-led sustainability initiatives more broadly.

AB  - One of the Indonesian government's policies to achieve national beef self-sufficiency is the 1000 beef village program. The program was piloted in many cattle-farming centers involving the operation of a feed bank to supply animal feed to tackle the challenge of feed limitation during the dry season. This study evaluates the sustainability status of an ongoing feed bank program and its development strategy based on the current progress of a feed bank used to serve five groups of farmers. Ninety sustainability attributes were derived based on six dimensions. The attributes were compiled from the primary data collected using a questionnaire. Expert opinions from practitioners were also considered in evaluating the attributes. The feed bank's sustainability status and development strategy were determined using the multi-dimensional scaling method with the rapid appraisal approach. It was found that the overall sustainability status of the feed bank was less sustainable, with an overall score of 49.55. The individual dimensions of (A) policy and government support, (B) raw material, (C) facilities and infrastructure, (D) feed bank management, (D) human resource management, (E) price, production, and (F) distribution systems posed sustainability scores of 48.48, 60.33, 48.57, 47.89, 48.76, and 44.64, respectively. Among the 90 predefined attributes, 21 were identified as highly sensitive through both the root mean square and expert opinion. Those attributes led to five main recommended development strategies: (1) strengthening the institution, (2) intensifying training, (3) increasing human resources (4) partnership developments, and (5) increasing the role of multi-stakeholders.

AB  - China's retail industry faces unique challenges in supply chain financing, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that often struggle to secure loans due to insufficient credit ratings and collateral in the business environment of China. This paper presents a groundbreaking approach that integrates real-time data elements into financing models, addressing the critical issue of information asymmetry between financial institutions and retail SMEs. By leveraging dynamic data such as orders, receivables, and project progress, our novel framework moves beyond the limitations of traditional asset-based lending, employing advanced data analytics for enhanced credit assessment and risk management. Applying the Stackelberg game theory, we explore the strategic interactions between suppliers and purchasers in the retail supply chain, identifying optimal financing strategies that improve capital flow efficiency and reduce overall costs. Our comprehensive data-driven model incorporates various scenarios, including the traditional supply chain financing model (Model T) and the innovative data-element secured financing model (Model G). The latter further considers risk assessment, risk appetite, volume, and schedule factors, providing a holistic approach to financial decision-making. Through rigorous mathematical modeling and numerical analysis, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework in optimizing supply chain financing strategies. The results highlight the potential for data-driven approaches to unlock new financing opportunities for SMEs, fostering a more collaborative and efficient ecosystem within the retail industry. This study presents comprehensive data-driven strategies that unlock new financing opportunities for SMEs, providing a practical roadmap for stakeholders to foster a more collaborative and efficient supply chain financing ecosystem. The significance of studying supply chain finance for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) lies in optimizing financing models to address the financing difficulties faced by SMEs. This helps improve their market competitiveness and promotes resource sharing and collaboration among all parties in the supply chain, thereby achieving sustainable economic development.

AB  - Effective project management is crucial for organizations to achieve strategic objectives and maintain competitiveness in today's market. The project management office (PMO) has emerged as a key enabler in enhancing project management effectiveness through centralized oversight, support, and standardization. However, evaluating the effectiveness of PMOs and identifying areas for improvement remain challenging. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of project management effectiveness and the role of PMOs in achieving organizational success by establishing a maturity rating system. The research objectives include identifying critical success factors relevant to sustainable PMO effectiveness, reviewing existing literature on project management maturity models, analyzing data through literature review and questionnaires, developing a rating system based on identified success factors, and contributing to the existing literature on PMOs. The literature review and thematic analysis identified five critical themes-organizational culture, governance, competence, project controls, and engagement-each with corresponding success factors. Questionnaires were used to assess the maturity levels and relative importance of these factors, where the AHP analysis determined the weighted importance of each success factor and category. The results highlight the critical success factors for PMOs: collaboration, effective leadership, alignment with organizational goals, knowledge management, project planning, risk management, stakeholder satisfaction, and communication. By establishing a standardized and objective approach to evaluating sustainable PMO effectiveness, organizations can enhance their sustainable project management practices, improve project success rates, and address the challenges associated with evaluating PMO performance. Ultimately, adopting a systems approach enables PMOs to align strategies with organizational goals and foster a culture of continuous improvement.

AB  - This paper presents an empirical study on key competencies of experienced sustainability professionals. We use an elaborate action research approach to collect and analyze qualitive data from sustainability professionals in Belgium (Wallonia). The iterative action-reflection process included a written assignment, an interactive workshop, qualitative data analyses, focus-group discussions, and the corroboration of findings through participant feedback. The 18 participating sustainability professionals had on average 24 years of work experience out of which 17 years in the field of sustainability. Our analysis provides strong empirical evidence for the existence of Sustainability Intervention Competencies which is a cluster of six key competencies, namely interpersonal collaboration competency, capacity building competency, intrapreneurial competency, strategic competency, political competency, and implementation competency. Together with a set of basic sustainability competencies they enable the profound analysis and understanding of sustainability issues, the co-creation of innovative solutions, and the facilitation of transition processes toward a sustainable future. Furthermore, we present empirical evidence for an integrated learning competency which binds two complementary forms of knowledge together, namely topical knowledge and lived experience. This study contributes to the newly forming empirical research stream on competencies of sustainability professionals in Sustainability Science. We outline implications for Human Resource Management as well as Higher Education and Vocational Training.

TI  - ASSESSING THE LEARNING IN SERVICE-LEARNING PROJECTS USING OUTCOME MEASURES RECOMMENDED BY THE COMMISSION ON PUBLIC RELATIONS EDUCATION
T2  - SCHOLARSHIP FOR SUSTAINING SERVICE-LEARNING AND CIVIC ENGAGEMENT
LA  - English
AB  - Practitioners of service-learning are well aware of the value of service-learning, including the enriching learning experiences for students and the positive effects for the community. In order for service-learning to be sustainable, research is needed that facilitates understanding and acceptance by stakeholders. One way to undertake research of this type is to use a framework suggested by practitioners and educators in a specific discipline. Results derived from an established framework are likely to be particularly compelling. Service-learning has become a common pedagogical approach in communication; however the absence of standard methods of assessment has made it more difficult to compare service-learn in g with other pedagogical strategies. This chapter seeks to address that gap by suggesting a methodological approach for assessing service-learning using a framework developed from the 2006 Report of the Commission on Public Relations Education (2006). Practitioners and educators identified criteria for beginning practitioners in public relations. This research demonstrates application of those criteria in 2 ways. The first involves using selected criteria to analyze reflective comments and comparing to a thematic analysis approach. The second involves developing a quantitative survey based oil the criteria. Students were asked to rate their learning oil each item based oil their service-learning experience. They were also asked to rate their ability on each item. This professionally defined assessment method potentially allows for a more standardized assessment technique to compare projects and programs, and may help provide evidence to garner institutional support for this pedagogy.

AB  - Similar to bile duct cancer or cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) in the western world, opisthorchiasis-associated CCA in Southeast Asia is an aggressive cancer with high mortality rates. It is known to cause a significant health burden in the opisthorchiasis region in Thailand and possibly throughout mainland Southeast. To reduce this health burden, a comprehensive prevention and control program for opisthorchiasis, as well as CCA, is required. In this review, our aim is to provide a brief update of the current situation regarding the natural history of opisthorchiasis and health burden of CCA in Southeast Asia. A comprehensive approach to tackling these issues being implemented in Thailand under the "Cholangiocarcinoma Screening and Care Program" is described. This comprehensive program consists of a three stage prevention and patient care program. The primary prevention component involves opisthorchiasis screening using a new and sensitive urine assay. The secondary prevention component involves screening for CCA and periductal fibrosis, with suspected CCA patients following the protocol for confirmation and appropriate treatment. Due to the eco-epidemiology of opisthorchiasis-induced CCA, the anticipated impacts and outcomes of the program include short-, medium-, and the long-term goals for the reduction of CCA incidence. To achieve long-term sustainable impacts, concerted efforts to raise social awareness and participating action by general public, non-government organizations, and government agencies are necessary. The strategic plans developed for this program can be expanded for use in other endemic areas as well as being a model for use in other chronic diseases.

AB  - The inclusion of an ecosystem services framework into planning and decision-making processes is increasingly being seen as a means to further a better implementation of the Ecosystem Approach and to achieve a more sustainable allocation of resources. Tools are slowly emerging to help scientists and practitioners with mapping ecosystem services. This study reviewed three tools with regard to theft potential use as standard tools to be employed in local planning. To this end, an email survey was conducted first to identify the most important criteria practitioners require in an ecosystem services mapping tool. InVEST and EcoServ-GIS were then applied to produce several ecosystem services maps for a small catchment in the Scottish Borders. These maps were compared to already existing maps produced with another method, SENCE. We showed that there can be substantial variations in maps produced with different tools. These reflect the differences between the tools, especially in their requirements for data, their user friendliness and their accuracy. Our comparison highlights that tools so far have had to make a compromise between usability and scientific accuracy, which means that practitioners need to carefully weigh the requirements for a specific project before deciding on the appropriate tool.

AB  - Introduction of the concept of sustainable development (SD) led to the transformation of values and interests of key stakeholders: the government, population and business. Since consideration of regional stakeholder interests is crucial for ensuring SD of large countries like Russia, a methodology is needed to assess their fulfilment, balance and consistency. However, previous studies of regional sustain- able development have not yet proposed such a methodology. The present paper examined and classi- fied regional stakeholder interests and developed an indicator framework to evaluate their fulfilment. We proposed an algorithm for calculating 9 group and 7 integral indices which were subsequently used to measure the socio-economic-environmental balance and inter-stakeholder consistency of interests. The methodology was applied to 17 regions of the Volga and Ural Federal Districts of Russia. The research discovered that sustainable development in most regions was at a medium level. There was no signifi- cant difference in the fulfilment of interests among the different stakeholders, which can be interpreted as a factor strengthening social cohesion. Additionally, a socio-economic-environmental imbalance was revealed: the fulfilment of social interests was the highest and that of environmental interests was the lowest. Regression modelling has shown that the presence of this imbalance has a negative impact on SD of Russian regions. The proposed methodology may contribute to broaden the scope of analytical re- search in the field of sustainable development.

AB  - With a growing human population facing multiple global change drivers (i.e. climate change and land management change), the future of food security is of major importance. Sustainable agriculture is therefore key to ensure food supply and food security under future climatic conditions. Forage provision (composed of forage quantity and forage quality) is an important ecosystem service of grasslands for dairy production. However, monitoring forage quality in semi-natural species-rich grasslands is rarely done due to the inherent complexity in determining forage quality, high variability within natural systems and financial and workload restrictions. Here, we i) demonstrate the ability of visible-near-infrared spectroscopy (vis-NIRS) to predict forage quality of bulk samples of species-rich montane pastures and ii) show its potential to reveal effects of two key global change drivers, climate change and land management, on forage quality. Spectral information and chemometrics allowed us to predict three (ash, fat and protein) out of four analyzed forage quality parameters with high accuracy. Land management intensity strongly influenced species-rich grasslands' protein and fat content, whereas altered climatic conditions influenced ash and fat content. High management intensity increased protein content of high- and mid-elevation pastures by 22 % and 30 % and fat content by 19 % and 20 % respectively. Though forage quality was improved by intensive land management, extensive land management generally revealed sufficient forage quality for livestock. Vis-NIRS provides a rapid, cost-efficient and high-throughput technique to analyze forage quality, revealing effects of global change drivers on forage quality of grasslands. This approach will help to support stakeholders assure optimal nutrition feeding of livestock and achieve steps towards sustainable agriculture.

AB  - Saudi Vision 2030, a strategic framework aimed at diversifying the economy and enhancing societal inclusivity, aligns with the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by promoting gender equality and sustainable economic growth. Sustainability is central to fostering women's entrepreneurship, as it drives social equity, economic diversification, and innovation, elements which are crucial to sustainable development. While the existing literature has primarily focused on women's entrepreneurship in the Western world, limited attention has been given to its development in the Global South, particularly in Saudi Arabia. As a nation undergoing transformative social, cultural, and economic shifts, women entrepreneurs play a critical role in aligning entrepreneurial efforts with global sustainability goals. This research investigates the factors influencing Saudi women to become entrepreneurs, specifically examining the factors that inspire or hinder them from creating their own ventures. Drawing upon cognitive and social capital theories, which have proven their soundness in the existing literature, this research utilizes a dataset of 1715 women entrepreneurs analyzed through binomial logistic regression. The findings indicate that social desirability, relational capital, experience as angel investors, age, income, and education significantly increase the likelihood of women's entrepreneurship. By contextualizing women's entrepreneurship within Saudi Arabia's evolving societal and economic landscape, this research highlights their potential as drivers of inclusive growth and sustainable economic empowerment. Furthermore, the research outlines strategies to enhance women's entrepreneurial participation, contributing both to the entrepreneurship literature and the realization of Saudi Vision 2030.

AB  - According to UNESCO, sustainable education requires a participatory development process. This article reports the results of three case studies about sustainable education using e-learning technologies, where the focus of the analysis is on the need for sustainable and participatory development processes. The research approach is based on a meta-synthesis of three cases that target capacity-building in Maritime Education and Training using modern digital technologies. The result of the analysis is an analytical framework that describes how sustainable development of education needs to be understood as a participatory process of education and technology knowledge development taking place in layers of (1) standards, (2) applications, and (3) in-situ development, and based on an evolutionary and participatory process. The analytical framework contributes to a better understanding of the relationship between education for sustainability and sustainability of education-a relation that is recognized to be of importance, but that is also recognized as not sufficiently conceptualized. As the empirical research in this article evidences, a better understanding of sustainable development processes is of academic as well as practical relevance to build educational capacity using E-Learning technologies.

AB  - Incorporating concerns of sustainability and circularity into design practice is undoubtedly important for both design research and education. There is a need to equip novice designers with the skills to facilitate a sustainability-focused future, whilst also collaborating with industry to implement these concerns into contemporary design practices. On the one hand, SMMEs and small teams in other sectors (i.e. public) lack the resources and time to improve their knowledge, to explore alternative ways of conducting business and to transform their design practices. Contrarily, novice designers (i.e. design students) can access state-of-the-art knowledge on sustainability and experiment with sustainable design practices throughout their education, yet they lack insights into market realities around implementation. Similarly, design researchers and educators are on the fore-front of developing sustainability-focused design methodology through research, but they often lack exposure to the industry. If the parties were all to work together, however, the sharing of resources, knowledge and experiences become valuable commodities in creating more sustainable design practices. This paper outlines an on-campus Design for Circular Economy and Sustainability training programme where industry worked with interns and academics to address real-world challenges. The project forms a part of a larger EU collaboration. The programme aimed to create a co-learning environment for novice designers, industry partners and design researcher/educators. Here all stakeholders could exchange their knowledge and insights and learn from each other to explore and experiment with practically implementing sustainability in real-world contexts. This paper briefly introduces the development of the programme and explores how and what co-learning occurred for the different stakeholders. Finally, the paper discusses how the outcomes of this programme subsequently affected the practices of industry partners. The programme offered a unique environment to prepare novice designers for the real world and provided researcher/educators with valuable insights on how to facilitate such a transition. The industry partners utilised this experience and outcomes to review their practices and kick-start the transition towards sustainable businesses. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose Sustainable purchasing and supply management (SPSM) is a lever of sustainable development for companies and remains an interesting research issue that can be analysed from various perspectives. By considering the polymorphic concept of proximity as a theoretical support, this research studies the buyer-supplier dyad and aims to answer the following question. How does the diversity of buyer-supplier dyad relationships influence the SPSM of direct and indirect purchases within a manufacturing company? Design/methodology/approach The authors used a qualitative approach founded on a matrix analysis to describe buyer-supplier relationships through the prism of the proximity concept. The field of study consists in a single case with embedded units including a manufacturing company and a sample of 13 suppliers of direct and indirect purchases. Findings The research reveals diverse combinations of proximities that characterise relationships between a buyer and suppliers of several purchasing categories. This diversity of relational contexts influences SPSM in different ways. The authors highlight three SPSM approaches labelled contractual, relational and embedded and describe practices carried out with suppliers as part of the different relational profiles. Research limitations/implications The research is developed in a single perspective. To ensure that it can be generalised, it should be applied in other contexts supported by new case studies. Practical implications The research provides practitioners with guidelines on building successful buyer-supplier partnerships in a sustainable view. The authors' findings aid managerial decision-making by validating the necessity of adapting SPSM depending on buyer-supplier relational situations. Originality/value This paper offers an original study angle on buyer-supplier relationships based on a proximity analysis. The authors' research confirms the variety of sustainable purchasing relationships underlined by the literature and can advance the portfolio approach to sustainable purchasing.

AB  - Weather and climate services (W&CS) are key to supporting the transition to net-zero emissions in the energy sector. These services are utilized to increase energy system resilience, enhance renewable energy deployment, and enable the uptake of energy-efficiency measures and innovations. As energy systems become increasingly dependent on and affected by weather and climatic conditions, integrating weather and climate data into energy management systems is essential. This paper addresses the gap in comprehensive guidance for developing integrated W&CS to support net-zero energy transitions, drawing upon a report by the World Meteorological Organization's Services Commission Study Group on Integrated Energy Services. We present a framework for coproduction of W&CS, exploring how the uptake of W&CS for energy transitions can be enabled through the evaluation of socioeconomic benefits, harnessing business models, identification of key policies, and capacity development measures. To support the uptake of W&CS for net-zero energy transitions, we recommend a deeper understanding of user needs and requirements; continuous advancements in the science and technology of W & CS; effective integration of weather and climate data within energy conversion models; improved accessibility and sharing of meteorological and, especially, energy data; promotion of coproduction approaches; exploration of novel applications of W&CS in the energy sector; refinement of business models for sustainable W&CS delivery; execution of capacity-building activities; and enhanced communication among stakeholders and strengthened collaborative efforts. These steps are crucial for realizing the full potential of W&CS in driving the energy sector toward a sustainable, net-zero future.

Online data collection was made and analyzed quantitatively initially using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Finally, this study conducted semi-structured interviews to gain a deeper understanding of survey responses.FindingsThis study found that SCSI in Pakistan, and their KIA about the CPEC have a significant impact on the ESE aspects of CPEC, which in turn have a significant impact on sustainable development of Pakistan. Finally, the social, followed by economic and environmental aspects of CPEC mediate the link 1) between SCSI in Pakistan and sustainable development of Pakistan as well as 2) between KIA about the CPEC and sustainable development of Pakistan.Practical implicationsStakeholders' perceptions of CPEC's sustainability and its relationship with sustainable development are crucial for governments and policymakers. The findings highlight the critical importance of addressing stakeholders' concerns and engaging them meaningfully to ensure the success and sustainability of CPEC projects. By doing so, governments and policymakers can foster a more inclusive and effective approach to sustainable development in Pakistan.Originality/valueUsing an explanatory mixed sequential design, this study developed and tested a novel research model that explores how stakeholders' perceptions of sustainability issues in Pakistan, along with their KIA toward CPEC, influence its ESE viability as a pathway to sustainable development in the country.

AB  - IntroductionThe use of near-peer teaching in medical schools is increasing internationally. Peer observation of teaching (POT) is a useful and effective method for enhancing teaching experiences and quality, but its use among student peer teachers is not well documented. The aim of the study was to explore medical student perceptions on the value and limitations of POT.MethodsTen medical students were trained as observers. Using a previously developed model, they observed 27 teaching sessions led by other students (observees), with a pre- and post-observation meeting. Observers and observees completed a survey and group interview to explore their experiences. Descriptive analysis of survey data and thematic analysis of qualitative data were conducted.ResultsObservees found feedback valuable in learning about, reflecting on, and increasing confidence in teaching practice. They felt comfortable receiving feedback and reported positively about the observers in terms of: expertise, relatability, non-intimidating presence, and awareness of the target audience. Observers reported learning more about good teaching practice. While most observers found it enjoyable, several found some aspects of giving feedback uncomfortable. Most found it difficult to establish a satisfactory dynamic, citing lack of credibility and difficulty in eliminating hierarchies. Pre-existing friendships were reported by observers as both helping and hindering the dynamic.DiscussionBoth observers and observees gained from the experience of POT. However, observers lacked confidence in their credibility. Further work should address how best to implement POT into the curriculum to improve teaching practice in medical students. Further training or coaching could be considered to overcome observers' concerns.Practice pointsConsider coaching observers to address concerns of credibility.Consider collaborating with experienced staff to ensure evaluation is robust.To support sustainability, consider facilitation of experienced observers training those more junior in POT.Following initial training, observers could be given the chance to shadow an observer, do an observation and debrief with a trainer.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to describe the ongoing shift in sustainable engineering and the approaches used by universities for engineering students. At the United Nations Earth Summit, in Rio de Janeiro, in 1992, participating nations agreed to work together to achieve the goal of sustainable development. Twenty years on, great progress has been made, but many challenges remain and overcoming them and ensuring a sustainable future will require the knowledge, skills and input of engineering professionals. Ethics and costs have long been part of engineering, but broader understanding is now needed because the skill set those engineers will need has grown dramatically.
   Design/methodology/approach - In this paper, the authors describe the ongoing shift to sustainable engineering and discuss a variety of approaches that universities are currently using to introduce engineering students and practitioners to sustainability principles and practice and how those can be utilized in mining and petroleum high education institutions.
   Findings - The authors first place sustainability in an engineering context and vice versa, and then review alternative approaches to incorporating sustainability in engineering curricula, briefly highlighting a few key concepts and documenting an example.
   Research limitations/implications - The authors first place sustainability in an engineering context and then review alternative approaches to incorporating sustainability in engineering curricula, briefly highlighting a few key concepts and documenting an example.
   Originality/value - The challenge to educators is to ensure that new concepts addressing sustainability are not only instilled in the next generation of engineers but are also being communicated to practicing engineers. Incorporating sustainability into mining and petroleum engineering education is identified as a way to engage students, encourage their enthusiasm and interest them in pursuing engineering as a career that is not only interesting but also contributes to society. Distance education is identified as a way to education practicing engineers about sustainability concepts.

AB  - Amid a time of unprecedented social-ecological change, professionals within and outside of the US wildlife conservation community have called for transformation of existing processes and structures to ensure that the benefits of wildlife conservation can be realized well into the future. Current momentum behind an initiative to help increase conservation relevancy among population segments that have historically been underserved by the conservation community is underway. Sustainable institutional change will not be realized, however, without attending to internal cultural change within the conservation community itself. Although elements of an ideal institution have been suggested, specific interventions related to institutional culture need deeper exploration. State fish and wildlife agencies-a primary organizational actor within the conservation community-play a central role in institutional transformation. Using a systems framework, this essay describes key leverage points for cultural change for which interventions could result in sustainable culture shifts. Five possible interventions are introduced to stimulate conversation among conservation practitioners seeking to initiate transformational change within their specific cultural contexts.

AB  - Urban Heat Vulnerability (UHV) has received increasing attention over the last two decades due to the exacerbation of global warming and the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect, amid rapid urbanisation and climate change. While there has been a notable growth in UHV research, systematic reviews and meta -analyses focusing on a broader range of issues and research trajectories are notably absent. This study aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the historical progression, current research clusters, and emerging trends in UHV research by utilising a scientometric method. It examines 2340 UHV-related scholarly articles published over the past fifty years (1970s to 2020s). The major findings of this scientometric analysis are: (a) UHV is an emerging research area and is expected to rapidly expand; (b) UHV research is clustered around five interconnected key areas: Urban planning and architectural design; Urban environment and ecology; Urban public health and wellbeing; Urban climate and meteorology; Urban remote sensing; (c) The recent shift in research focus towards public health and wellbeing perspectives in UHV studies highlights the importance of a human -social focus and interdisciplinary collaboration; (d) Remote sensing, particularly supported by machine learning, is a significant technical tool in UHV research; (e) UHV research aligns with the UN sustainable development goals and contributes to achieving urban sustainability and climate resilience. Further advancements in UHV research will require interdisciplinary collaboration, technological innovations, and targeted policies to effectively address urban heat impacts and protect vulnerable populations.

AB  - Nowadays, social media applications (SMAs) which are quite popular among students have a significant influence on education sustainability. However, there is a lack of research that explores elements of the constructivist learning approach with the technology acceptance model (TAM) in higher education. Therefore, this research aimed to minimize the literature gap by examining the SMA factors used for active collaborative learning (ACL) and engagement (EN) to affect the students' academic performance in measuring education sustainability, as well as examining their satisfaction from its use. This study employed constructivism theory and TAM as the investigation model, and applied a quantitative method and analysis through surveying 192 university students at King Faisal University. Using structural equation modeling (SEM), the responses were sorted into nine factors and analyzed to explain students' academic performance in measuring education sustainability, as well as their satisfaction. The results were analyzed with structural equation modelling; it was shown that all the hypotheses were supported and positively related to sustainability for education, confirming significant relationships between the use of SMAs and the rest of the variables considered in our model (interactivity with peers (IN-P), interactivity with lecturers (IN-L), ACL, EN, perceived ease of use (PEOU), perceived usefulness (PU), SMA use, student satisfaction (SS), and students' academic performance (SAP).

AB  - This study investigates the interplay between digitalization capability, environmental sustainability perception, and radical innovation performance with a particular focus on the mediating roles of knowledge integration capability and knowledge accumulation. The study utilizes Structural Equation Modeling and the Hayes PROCESS Model to analyze data from 315 firms in technology-driven industries. The findings reveal that digitalization capability significantly enhances radical innovation performance (beta = 0.767, p < 0.001, R-2 = 0.589), while environmental sustainability perception does not directly influence innovation performance nor mediate its relationship with digitalization. However, knowledge integration capability and knowledge accumulation emerge as critical enablers, strengthening the effect of digitalization on innovation outcomes. Moreover, knowledge integration capability positively moderates the digitalization capability-radical innovation performance relationship, demonstrating that firms with higher knowledge integration capability derive greater innovation benefits from digital transformation. In contrast, environmental sustainability perception does not moderate this relationship, suggesting that sustainability perception alone is insufficient to drive radical innovation. The findings provide insights for firms leveraging digitalization to drive innovation and efficiency. Knowledge integration and accumulation are key to sustaining competitive advantage. These results contribute to the literature on digital transformation, innovation management, and sustainability, highlighting the necessity of knowledge-driven mechanisms in leveraging digitalization for innovation success. This study offers valuable managerial insights by highlighting the strategic significance of knowledge integration and accumulation in enhancing the effectiveness of digital transformation on innovation performance. Future research should explore longitudinal dynamics, sectoral variations, and additional moderating factors such as digital leadership and organizational culture to deepen the understanding of this evolving field.

AB  - Land degradation poses a significant global challenge, adversely affecting soil quality and diminishing the productivity of arable land, which, in turn, impacts food production and ecosystem services. This degradation manifests in various forms, including soil compaction, salinity, nutrient depletion, loss of biodiversity, and contamination, ultimately rendering soil unproductive and exacerbating climate change. Given the challenges arising from conventional farming practices and climate change, there is an urgent necessity to develop agricultural systems that not only enhance agronomic efficiency but also improve environmental performance. This study focuses on addressing food security in Africa by investigating the role of land restoration and biodiversity in sustainable food systems through a comprehensive bibliometric analysis for documents between 2010 to 2023, identifying 64 relevant documents. The analysis reveals insights into the most-cited documents and thematic evolution, underscoring the significant contributions from Ethiopia and advocating for collaborative efforts among African nations. Key themes identified include "climate change", "food security", "biodiversity conservation", and "agroecosystems", all highlighting the importance of sustainable agricultural practices. The study anticipates a continued prioritization of agroecosystems, smart agriculture, and biodiversity conservation to tackle food security challenges in the face of climate change. Collaboration, investment in research, and practical initiatives emerge as essential components for achieving sustainable food security and mitigating climate change impacts in Africa. This research provides valuable insights into the current landscape and future trends regarding the contributions of land restoration and biodiversity to food systems in Africa, emphasizing the critical need for concerted efforts to address these pressing issues.

AB  - This paper aims to assess the influence of land use and land cover (LULC) indicators and population density on water quality parameters during dry and rainy seasons in a tourism area in Indonesia. This study applies least squares regression (OLS) and Pearson correlation analysis to see the relationship among factors, and all LULC and population density were significantly correlated with most of water quality parameter with P values of 0.01 and 0.05. For example, DO shows high correlation with population density, farm, and built-up in dry season; however, each observation point has different percentages of LULC and population density. The concentration value should be different over space since watershed characteristics and pollutions sources are not the same in the diverse locations. The geographically weighted regression (GWR) analyze the spatially varying relationships among population density, LULC categories (i.e., built-up areas, rice fields, farms, and forests), and 11 water quality indicators across three selected rivers (Ayung, Badung, and Mati) with different levels of tourism urbanization in Bali Province, Indonesia. The results explore that compared with OLS estimates, GWR performed well in terms of their R-2 values and the Akaike information criterion (AIC) in all the parameters and seasons. Further, the findings exhibit population density as a critical indicator having a highly significant association with BOD and E. Coli parameters. Moreover, the built-up area has correlated positively to the water quality parameters (Ni, Pb, KMnO4 and TSS). The parameter DO is associated negatively with the built-up area, which indicates increasing built-up area tends to deteriorate the water quality. Hence, our findings can be used as input to provide a reference to the local governments and stakeholders for issuing policy on water and LULC for achieving a sustainable water environment in this region.

AB  - In this paper, we determine the role of knowledge in the development and consolidation of social innovation (SI) on the revitalisation of traditional farming in marginalised rural settings. We seek to address the following questions: (i) how the co-production of knowledge in SI initiatives for the revitalisation of traditional farming might influence its development path, and (ii) how the networking of local and external actors accelerates knowledge co-production and triggers the reconfiguration of social practices towards sustainability transformation. To answer these questions, we applied mixed-method approach by investigating the example of SI initiative (the case of Vlkolinec UNESCO site in Slovakia). We conducted a focus group, semi-structured and structured interviews, historical analysis and social network analysis with the actors involved in the SI. Based on the empirical results we revealed how mix of local and external knowledge and knowledge co-production can enhance the development of SI through the networking of numerous local stakeholders, particularly science and policy representatives. This knowledge sharing and knowledge co-production strengthened the development path of the SI in seeking to initiate effective measures for local people to return to traditional small-scale farming, supporting traditional crafts, creating new green jobs and conditions for improving the quality of life for local people, and new services for sustainable tourism. Our results highlight the importance of external knowledge in the expansion of bonding social capital, and the establishment of a regional knowledge network of local and external actors to trigger SI in rural areas. The analyses reveal that multi-actor networks that support knowledge exchange play an important role in SI development paths.

AB  - Tibetan Buddhism, as an indigenous religion, has a significant and far-reaching influence in the Tibetan areas of China. This study, focusing on Lhasa, explores the integration of Tibetan Buddhist spiritual perceptions within urban spaces. Employing a novel approach that combines street view data and deep learning technology, the research aims to identify and map the spatial distribution of Tibetan Buddhist spiritual sites against the backdrop of the urban landscape. Our analysis reveals a notable concentration of these spiritual places near urban architectural and cultural heritage areas, highlighting the profound connection between residents' cultural life and spiritual practices. Despite challenges posed by modern urbanisation, these spiritual sites demonstrate resilience and adaptability, continuing to serve as cultural and spiritual pillars of the Tibetan Buddhist community. This study contributes to the fields of urban planning, religious studies, and digital humanities by demonstrating the potential of technology in examining the impact of urban development on cultural and religious landscapes. The research underscores the importance of protecting and integrating spaces of spiritual perception in urban development planning. It shows that safeguarding these spaces is crucial not only for cultural heritage preservation but also for achieving sustainable urban development and social harmony. This study opens new avenues for interdisciplinary research, advocating for a deeper understanding of the dynamic relationship between urban development and spiritual spaces from psychological, sociological, and environmental science perspectives. As urban landscapes evolve, the study emphasises the need to maintain a balance between material sustainability and cultural and spiritual richness in urban planning.

AB  - Scientists are frequently faced with the important decision to start or terminate a creative partnership. This process can be influenced by strategic motivations, as early career researchers are pursuers, whereas senior researchers are typically attractors, of new collaborative opportunities. Focusing on the longitudinal aspects of scientific collaboration, we analyzed 473 collaboration profiles using an egocentric perspective that accounts for researcher-specific characteristics and provides insight into a range of topics, from career achievement and sustainability to team dynamics and efficiency. From more than 166,000 collaboration records, we quantify the frequency distributions of collaboration duration and tie strength, showing that collaboration networks are dominated by weak ties characterized by high turnover rates. We use analytic extreme value thresholds to identify a new class of indispensable super ties, the strongest of which commonly exhibit >50% publication overlap with the central scientist. The prevalence of super ties suggests that they arise from career strategies based upon cost, risk, and reward sharing and complementary skill matching. We then use a combination of descriptive and panel regression methods to compare the subset of publications coauthored with a super tie to the subset without one, controlling for pertinent features such as career age, prestige, team size, and prior group experience. We find that super ties contribute to above-average productivity and a 17% citation increase per publication, thus identifying these partnerships-the analog of life partners-as a major factor in science career development.

AB  - Due to a growing population, urbanization, industrialization and agriculture, the quality of nature and biodiversity globally has decreased enormously. This also applies to The Netherlands. Habitat banking is a market-based instrument for nature conservation and sustainable development to counteract this decrease. We analyze under which conditions habitat banking can indeed offer possibilities and opportunities for improving biodiversity, nature conservation and sustainable development in The Netherlands. For this, we first identify the shortcomings of mandatory nature compensation in The Netherlands and link them to current innovations in Dutch nature policy. In addition, we investigate three necessary instruments for a successful habitat banking system: (1) a system for nature valuation, (2) a method for creating ecological opportunity maps, and (3) the institutional setting in which habitat banking can be operationalized. We conclude that habitat banking contributes to solving the problems for nature and biodiversity and to sustainable development in The Netherlands, provided that this is primarily addressed (i) in the domain of voluntary nature compensation, (ii) in bottom-up pilots for integrated area development (in this article shortly referred to as area pilots) where the widest possible range of owners and users of these areas is involved, (iii) in a context of participatory decision-making and (iv) learning and experiment en route to social-ecological systems (SESs). To actually realize the added value of habitat banking for The Netherlands, further scientific research is required to collect and analyze empirical data from relevant stakeholders.

AB  - The adoption of pesticide mitigation measures and innovation at farm level, are seen as a drivers to reach the sustainable water policy objectives. With the aim to prevent the pesticide pressure of hilly vineyards on groundwater contamination, a stepwise approach in Tidone Valley was applied using different consultation mechanisms and involvement strategies throughout the overall process. Face to face meetings, direct surveys, participatory monitoring and planning of several activities aiming to inform, educate, improve skills, change of individual behaviour or raise awareness, or even initiatives to build institutional trust or support for new investment in innovation are some examples. These activities allowed us to involve key actors of water use and governance (such as farmers, advisors, representatives of drinking water management, farmer's associations, Winemaking cooperatives, local Health Authority), and to have a deeper knowledge of the context agricultural practices, of farmer's knowledge and skills concerning factors influencing water contamination and also to promote the most suitable Best Management Practices aimed at limiting the pesticide occurrence in groundwater. Indeed, the surveys results highlighted that the majority of the farms are small (64% of vineyards <10 ha), that most of the farmers (62%) are not aware of the current legislation on water, even if 64% of them declare to participate regularly to training courses for the prevention of water contamination and that there is a low to moderate level of adoption of Best Practices able to prevent contamination by pesticides. At the end of the overall process, it can be stated that the multi-actor approach and engagement strategy adopted were successful in improving attitudes to more sustainable practices. This is supported also by the monitoring data that show in 2019 a decrease by 44% of pesticides occurrences and a fall by 68% of values above EQS(gw) if compared with the period 2017-2018.

TI  - Addressing China's grand challenge of achieving food security while ensuring environmental sustainability
T2  - SCIENCE ADVANCES
LA  - English
AB  - China's increasingly urbanized and wealthy population is driving a growing and changing demand for food, which might not be met without significant increase in agricultural productivity and sustainable use of natural resources. Given the past relationship between lack of access to affordable food and political instability, food security has to be given a high priority on national political agendas in the context of globalization. The drive for increased food production has had a significant impact on the environment, and the deterioration in ecosystem quality due to historic and current levels of pollution will potentially compromise the food production system in China. We discuss the grand challenges of not only producing more food but also producing it sustainably and without environmental degradation. In addressing these challenges, food production should be considered as part of an environmental system (soil, air, water, and biodiversity) and not independent from it. It is imperative that new ways of meeting the demand for food are developed while safeguarding the natural resources upon which food production is based. We present a holistic approach to both science and policy to ensure future food security while embracing the ambition of achieving environmental sustainability in China. It is a unique opportunity for China to be a role model as a new global player, especially for other emerging economies.

AB  - Mar Piccolo of Taranto is an estuarine basin heavily exploited for commercial mussel (Mytilus galloprovincialis L.) farming. The historical renown of the Taranto mussels has suffered over the last decade following policy decisions to expand the mussel farms and to relocate a portion of the urban sewage to an outfall outside of Mar Piccolo. The resulting decline in mussel quality and the quandary of how to restore stability to Taranto mussel production became the focal issue for our application of the systems approach framework (SAF). We simulated the ecological, economic, and social interactions that affect mussel production. Stakeholders and mussel farmers contributed by participating in meetings during the entire exercise. Our simulation analysis provided them with a means for understanding the effects of policy scenarios on the system. We present three aspects from our initial results that demonstrate the value of the SAF, as: (1) an operational model to monitor and better research the status of the ecosystem, (2) a management tool to evaluate sustainable mussel farming strategies, and (3) an opportunity for improved communication with and engagement of stakeholders, policy, and the public. The application has also raised important questions about how the food chain is controlled, what could be changed to stabilize the ecosystem to a higher level of productivity, and what role the public and policy could play in promoting sustainable development.

AB  - High population growth rates and poverty are likely to elevate the vulnerability of many coastal communities in the Pacific region to climate change. Alternative livelihood strategies which can generate income and simultaneously conserve fish stocks and their habitats are a priority. This paper investigates the feasibility of 'sport fishing' (recreational catch and release angling for particular species of predatory game fish) as such a strategy. The limited research of sport fisheries in developing countries is augmented with a review of community-based ecotourism, integrated conservation and development projects (ICDPs) and common property management literature to propose design principles. Five prerequisite principles for the success of sport fishery enterprises are suggested. First, adequate local capacity must be available to manage a tourism business and facilities, supported by cross-scale co-management amongst stakeholders. Second, appropriate governance arrangements must be in place to ensure the equitable dispersal of benefits to all members of the local community, and conflict resolution. Third, resource-ownership boundaries and rights must be clearly delineated before the enterprise begins in order to minimise the potential for future conflict. Fourth, social, biodiversity and ecosystem service co-benefits should result from the enterprise. These should include improvements in income, health, education, food security, the status of the target and non-target species and their habitat and non-fishery ecosystem services. Fifth, monitoring and evaluation of these principles is required within an adaptive co-management framework which takes a social-ecological systems approach and includes all stakeholders in social learning and power-sharing. Through this, broader impacts of the enterprise may emerge which go beyond the standard assessment of ecotourism and ICDP success in financial or biodiversity terms. These principles now need to be tested by researching the experiences of case studies of sport fishing enterprises in the Pacific. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Human factors affecting e-Agriculture should be identified and understood to ensure the success and sustainability of e-Agriculture projects. However, specific human factors influencing e-Agriculture in sub-Saharan Africa have never been consolidated. In this regard, the current study reviewed diverse literature and consolidated the human factors and gaps limiting the expansion of e-Agriculture in sub-Saharan Africa to inform the sustainability of projects millions of people in the region rely on for their livelihood. Employing a systematic literature review method, the study initially retrieved 1624 relevant articles from seven e-databases. The retrieved articles were filtered to the 14 most representative articles using the standard protocol to narrow a database. The results revealed human factors and gaps limiting e-Agriculture projects in sub-Saharan Africa as inadequate education and training, age, gender bias, lack of experience, lack of awareness, exclusion of farmers, lack of user-centred requirements, exaggerated expectations and lack of trust and transparency. Thus, the study enlightens e-Agriculture service providers and policy practitioners on issues about human factors that need improvement to facilitate the success and sustainability of e-Agricultural projects. Likewise, the study draws the attention of stakeholders to devise mitigation measures against human factors affecting e-Agriculture projects in sub-Saharan Africa.

AB  - Community-based approaches to natural resource management are being discussed and experienced as promising ways for pursuing ecological conservation and socio-economic development simultaneously. However, the multiplicity of levels, scales, objectives and actors that are involved in sustainability transformations tends to be challenging for such bottom-up approaches. Collaborative and polycentric governance schemes are proposed for dealing with those challenges. What has not been fully explored is how knowledge from local contexts of community-based initiatives can be diffused to influence practices on higher levels and/or in other local contexts. This study explores how theoretical advances in the diffusion of grassroots innovation can contribute to understanding and supporting the diffusion of knowledge and practices from community-based initiatives and proposes a transdisciplinary approach to diffusion. For that aim, we develop an analytical perspective on the diffusion of grassroots innovations that takes into consideration the multiplicity of actors, levels and scales, the different qualities/types of knowledge and practices, as well as their respective contributions. We focus on the multiplicity and situatedness of cognitive frames and conceptualize the diffusion of grassroots innovations as a transdisciplinary process. In this way three different diffusion pathways are derived in which the knowledge and practices of grassroots initiatives can be processed in order to promote their (re)interpretation and (re)application in situations and by actors that do not share the cognitive frame and the local context of the originating grassroots initiative. The application of the developed approach is illustrated through transdisciplinary research for the diffusion of sustainable family farming innovations in Colombia. This conceptualization accounts for the emergence of multiplicity as an outcome of diffusion by emphasizing difference as a core resource in building sustainable futures.

Positioned as a technology-focused concept that can generate economic gains while alleviating pressure on the environment, circular economy enjoys a positive reception by organisations in public, private and civic sectors and, increasingly, academia alike. However, concerns have been raised regarding some purported circular economy practices being promoted as 'sustainable' yet resulting in detrimental impacts on environment and society. We briefly revisit the systems ecology literature that construed the context for both circular economy and sustainable development. Values and principles in core sustainable development literature are analysed to offer a foundation against which circular economy can be discussed. We then analyse and critically reflect upon the strengths, shortcomings and theoretical flaws within the values and principles that emerged from the evolving circular economy literature. We propose a value framework and set of ten principles for the design, implementation and evaluation of a sustainable circular economy. We finish with a call for action for both practitioners and a research agenda for academia. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of Institution of Chemical Engineers.

AB  - Incorporating concerns of sustainability and circularity into design practice is undoubtedly important for both design research and education. There is a need to equip novice designers with the skills to facilitate a sustainability-focused future, whilst also collaborating with industry to implement these concerns into contemporary design practices. On the one hand, SMMEs and small teams in other sectors (i.e. public) lack the resources and time to improve their knowledge, to explore alternative ways of conducting business and to transform their design practices. Contrarily, novice designers (i.e. design students) can access state-of-the-art knowledge on sustainability and experiment with sustainable design practices throughout their education, yet they lack insights into market realities around implementation. Similarly, design researchers and educators are on the fore-front of developing sustainability-focused design methodology through research, but they often lack exposure to the industry. If the parties were all to work together, however, the sharing of resources, knowledge and experiences become valuable commodities in creating more sustainable design practices.
   This paper outlines an on-campus Design for Circular Economy and Sustainability training programme where industry worked with interns and academics to address real-world challenges. The project forms a part of a larger EU collaboration. The programme aimed to create a co-learning environment for novice designers, industry partners and design researcher/educators. Here all stakeholders could exchange their knowledge and insights and learn from each other to explore and experiment with practically implementing sustainability in real-world contexts. This paper briefly introduces the development of the programme and explores how and what co-learning occurred for the different stakeholders. Finally, the paper discusses how the outcomes of this programme subsequently affected the practices of industry partners. The programme offered a unique environment to prepare novice designers for the real world and provided researcher/educators with valuable insights on how to facilitate such a transition. The industry partners utilised this experience and outcomes to review their practices and kick-start the transition towards sustainable businesses. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Microgrids (MGs) connected with multiple distributed renewable generations, energy storage equipment, and stochastic loads have recently attracted significant attention. However, uncertainties in renewable energy availabilities and demand side widely exist in the MG energy system. A top-down decision strategy should be developed with respect to the conflicts among different stakeholders. This study presents a layered modeling framework for the synergic optimization of the MC system with considering price-based demand response program. This layered framework can not only involve multiple renewable technologies for ensuring sustainable development but also capture the noncooperative relationship among different stakeholders. The leader enjoys a decision-making priority to optimize the environmental performance of the MG energy system. The follower takes corresponding actions to optimize economic goals. The effectiveness of the developed model is then illustrated through a real-world MC system in Lize Financial Business District, Beijing, China. Results can facilitate the following: (a) identification of the effects of load shifting and charging-discharging characteristics on the MG operation; (b) development of sustainable electricity generation in environmentally and economically sustainable ways. The layered model proves its effectiveness in developing collaborative schemes for comprehensively achieving the cost-emission goals compared with the traditional single-objective models.

AB  - Strategic partnerships between universities and declining urban neighborhoods with limited resources have resulted in some innovative and forward-thinking approaches to land use and planning. These approaches respond to the impacts of boom-and-bust through the implementation of problem-based solutions and have spurred development to make communities more resilient. The university-community partnerships and engagements have multiple goals, including increasing university responsiveness to local needs, stimulating real-world change, and preparing students to effectively address complex social challenges (Dorado and Giles, 2004). However, such approaches are complicated by a variety of factors, including stakeholder expectations, power imbalances, and the conflicting goals of educators and community members (Mansuri and Rao, 2004). While the benefits of service-learning programs to universities are well documented, the benefits of such higher education partnerships to community participants are not as well known (Netshandama, 2010). Successful engagements seem to require community involvement and decision-making authority at every phase, mutual accountability, and trust (Winkler, 2013). This paper refers to a series of case studies of community engagement and neighborhood empowerment that involved the development of a collective sustainable plan/vision for declining inner-city neighborhoods with limited resources. This participatory form of local community development combines and goes beyond spatial planning and land use tools to demonstrate in some depth how an "inside the neighborhood" approach can make communities less vulnerable to boom-and-bust cycles. These neighborhoods, located in Columbus, Ohio, have seen tremendous declines in population and economy over the past years because of significant losses in manufacturing jobs. The case studies can inspire communities and demonstrate that service learning has the potential to provide communities with place-specific guidelines and recommendations that improve the quality of life for residents; but their implementation requires a collective effort that goes beyond the classroom.

AB  - Smart technologies are useful for performance monitoring i.e. to gather real-life evidence to address the designperformance gap, reduce emissions, optimise energy use, address energy inequalities, empower and engage citizens. Smart home performance monitoring therefore has wider connotations of societal utility. However, current technology adoption models do not address this question of societal value. This study investigates the correlations between acceptance, adoption, affordance, and active citizenship as the basis for householder participation in smart performance monitoring 'for the common good'. The aim is to propose an integrated framework for engendering householders' participation in bridging the performance gap. The research design combined theoretical and methodological triangulation. First, it reviewed and consolidated existing technology adoption models to establish a conceptual household participation framework. Then, a survey was deployed until 972 nationally representative sample was achieved. Lastly, Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) was used to test goodness-of-fit hypotheses, to validate the framework. The result confirms that smart home performance monitoring implementation promote acceptance first by addressing citizenship/active participation factors. Therefore, policy initiatives should prioritise issues of trust, capacity for sustainable, social and technology innovativeness, and cost-benefit. Then resolve affordance factors such as perceived cost, performance expectancy, data security and perceived savings to promote adoption. Significantly, hedonic value, and social influence were not proven as effective for promoting participation. Therefore, the proposed participation framework contributes new theoretical and strategic insights into how smart home performance monitoring can be deployed to address the performance gap and aid the transition to net zero homes.

AB  - Excess agricultural nitrogen, mainly from manure and chemical fertilizers, is a primary source of nutrient pollution and presents serious environmental threats to natural ecosystems and human health. Improvements in nitrogen-use efficiency in crop production are critical for addressing the triple challenge of food insecurity, environmental degradation, and climate change. Approaches such as sustainable intensification that stress technological innovations have received the most attention. But science-based cropland use planning, a promising complementary approach, has so far been largely overlooked. Here we develop a spatially integrated economic-ecological modeling method to assess this previously unexplored potential for improving the economic-environmental performance of crop production by examining the seasonal and spatial implications of cropland and fertilizer use in Bangladesh. In doing so, we aim to make the modeling method accessible to researchers and practitioners interested in achieving the dual goal of food production and environmental sustainability for countries that are characterized by seasonal and spatial variations in crop mix and cropping practices.
   - The modeling method combines economic and ecological models to explore trade-offs between food security and environmental sustainability.
   - The modeling method considers both spatial and seasonal dimensions when measuring trade-offs.
   - The modeling method is highly suitable for adaptation to study topics concerning food security-ecosystem service trade-offs or to inform the design of related models. (c) 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Today, innovating with a user community seems an effective strategy for developing a firm's innovation capacity. However, short-term benefits from this collaboration are no longer sufficient, and firms are now looking to develop a sustainable relationship with users, to maintain sustainable innovation. This study furthers our understanding of the way in which a user toolkit connected to a community serves to manage innovation of an existing product or service. The literature provides a limited understanding of the role of a user toolkit in the management of a sustainable innovation approach in firms. The research is based on a longitudinal case study of the video game Trackmania, which has an integrated toolkit connected to a large and active user community. Results confirm the crucial role of the toolkit in the construction, control and maintenance of a sustainable innovative approach with a user community. From the innovation perspective, the toolkit can be considered as a means of managing the boundary between the firm and the user community, because it enables the community to structure itself as a multi-sided platform, where all categories of users participate in value creation. Finally, we identify four modalities for managing sustainable innovation with a user community toolkit.

AB  - Sustainable business practices (SBPs) are pivotal for achieving sustainable economic growth by balancing environmental, social, and economic dimensions. This study investigates the determinants of SBPs in Muslim-majority nations, focusing on Indonesia and Brunei Darussalam. Specifically, it examines the roles of awareness, Islamic moral values, and innovation in fostering sustainability across diverse industries. A quantitative research design was employed, utilizing a structured survey with 29 indicators distributed to 75 business owners and managers. Data were analyzed using an ordered logit model to explore the relationship between the determinants and business sustainability. The findings reveal that awareness significantly influences SBPs, with businesses that prioritize waste management and environmental preservation demonstrating higher sustainability outcomes. Islamic moral values also contribute positively by fostering ethical practices and stakeholder trust, although their impact is less pronounced without complementary innovation. Conversely, innovation, including green technologies and digitalization, showed limited significance due to barriers such as resource constraints and insufficient collaboration with universities and industry peers. This study highlights the importance of integrating awareness, ethical governance, and innovation to enhance SBPs in developing nations. It underscores the need for multi-stakeholder collaboration, targeted policies, and capacity-building initiatives to address gaps in innovation and external partnerships. The findings contribute to the broader discourse on sustainable development by providing actionable insights into the socio-cultural and economic contexts of Muslim-majority countries. Future research should explore sector-specific dynamics, advanced technologies, and longitudinal impacts to further elucidate pathways for achieving sustainable business growth.

AB  - Background Wasting is perhaps one of the signs of malnutrition that has been linked to the deaths of children suffering from malnutrition. As a result, understanding its correlations and drivers is critical. Using quantile regression analysis, this research aims to contribute to the discussion on under-5 malnutrition by analyzing the predictors of wasting in Bangladesh.
   Methods and materials The dataset was extracted from the 2017-18 Bangladesh demographic and health survey (BDHS) data. The weight-for-height (WHZ) z-score based anthropometric indicator was used in the study as the target variable. The weighted sample constitutes 8,334 children of under-5 years. However, after cleaning the missing values, the analysis is based on 8,321 children. Sequential quantile regression was used for finding the contributing factors.
   Results The findings of this study depict that the prevalence of wasting in children is about 8 percent and only approximately one percent of children are severely wasted in Bangladesh. Age, mother's BMI, and parental educational qualification, are all major factors of the WHZ score of a child. The coefficient of the female child increased from 0.1 to 0.2 quantiles before dropping to 0.75 quantile. For a child aged up to three years, the coefficients have a declining tendency up to the 0.5 quantile, then an increasing trend. Children who come from the richest households had 16.3%, 3.6%, and 15.7% higher WHZ scores respectively than children come from the poorest households suggesting that the risk of severe wasting in children under the age of five was lower in children from the wealthiest families than in children from the poorest families. The long-term malnutrition indicator (wasting) will be influenced by the presence of various childhood infections and vaccinations. Furthermore, a family's economic position is a key determinant in influencing a child's WHZ score.
   Conclusions It is concluded that socioeconomic characteristics are correlated with the wasting status of a child. Maternal characteristics also played an important role to reduce the burden of malnutrition. Thus, maternal nutritional awareness might reduce the risk of malnutrition in children. Moreover, the findings disclose that to enrich the nutritional status of children along with achieving Sustainable Development Goal (SDG)-3 by 2030, a collaborative approach should necessarily be taken by the government of Bangladesh, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) at the community level in Bangladesh.

AB  - This study focused on fabricating a cellulose aerogel for oil spill clean-up, using common reed (Phragmites australis) as the cellulose source. The process involved isolating cellulose from reed via traditional Kraft pulping, considering the effects of key factors on the isolated cellulose content. After a two-stage HP bleaching sequence, the highest cellulose content achieved was 27.2%, with 80% ISO brightness and 1% ash content under mild Kraft pulping conditions of 30% sulfidity, 20% active alkali (AA), sustained cooking at 165 degrees C for 3 h, and a liquor-to-reed ratio of 8 : 1. Subsequently, reed-based cellulose aerogel was fabricated via a freeze-drying method using an eco-friendly NaOH/poly(ethylene glycol) aqueous solvent system, which was then modified with methyltrimethoxysilane. The resulting aerogel exhibited remarkable characteristics, including a low density of 0.04 g cm-3, high porosity of 96%, high hydrophobicity with a water contact angle (WAC) of 141 degrees, and a superior crude oil adsorption capacity of 35 g g-1. Comprehensive characterizations of the fabricated materials, including scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis/differential scanning calorimetry, and WAC measurements, were evaluated. This interdisciplinary study explores the commercial promise of reed-based cellulose aerogel as a sustainable solution for oil spill clean-up efforts.

AB  - Small plastic particles like Microplastics have become a global environmental concern including in Bangladesh due to their persistence in the environment and potential harm to aquatic lives and human health. This article aims to provide a comprehensive review of the current scenario of microplastic pollution and explores the sources, distribution, and impacts of microplastic pollution on human health, marine, and terrestrial ecosystems as well as utilizes a systematic literature review method to identify and analyze the available research on microplastic pollution in Bangladeshi perspective. The results show plastic waste mismanagement, such as inadequate waste collection, disposal, and recycling as the origin of microplastic pollution. The article examines the distribution of microplastics in various environmental matrices such as water bodies, soil, and biota and discusses the potential ecological and human health impacts of microplastic pollution in Bangladesh. Moreover, the study highlights the potential risks of microplastic ingestion by aquaticorganisms, such as shrimp, crabs, and fish which ultimately affect human health through the food chain. The study suggests several mitigation strategies including improving waste management practices, promoting public awareness, developing policies and regulations to reduce plastic use, and increasing recycling. Overall, this review contributes to the existing knowledge on microplastic pollution in Bangladesh and provides useful insights for policymakers, researchers, and practitioners to develop effective strategies for mitigating this environmental problem. However, the involvement of all stakeholders including policymakers, industries, and the general public is necessary to achieve a sustainable and healthy environment for the country.

AB  - This chapter analyzes the complex interplays between and among sustainability, resilience, adaptation and transformation, key paradigms and analytical concepts that have emerged from the human-environmental interactions, social-ecological systems, and global environmental change literatures. Specifically, this chapter provides a summary of how these key paradigms and analytical concepts have evolved over time and synthesizes current debates about their interplays. Our findings reveal certain theoretical synergies between and among sustainability, resilience, adaptation and transformation, as well as epistemological tensions and practical tradeoffs when actions are taken to promote ostensibly desirable attributes of social-ecological systems through on-the-ground actions. These findings highlight the need for scholars, practitioners and policy makers to be explicit about the normative assumptions associated with sustainability, resilience, adaptation and transformation as they complement or contradict each other in local contexts, and how they may affect or be affected by the characteristics of and processes within local communities. Such understanding will be crucial for moving towards developing adaptation or transformation interventions that maximize the achievement of sustainability or resilience policy goals and minimize potential negative outcomes on both human well-being and environmental conditions.

AB  - Research in the fields of organizational behavior, human resources, or sustainable development management has paid much attention to employee job satisfaction and suggests it is critical to a firm obtaining a dominant position and gaining competitive advantage in a competitive environment. From the internal marketing perspective, how to satisfy employee job satisfaction to retain the valuable human resources needed to achieve sustainable development of the organization is a major concern of scholars and practitioners. However, most studies focus on above-average job satisfaction and relatively neglect below-average job satisfaction. Accordingly, this study categorized relevant antecedents into causal configurations for identifying the sufficient conditions of job (dis)satisfaction. Specifically, this study investigated how employees can achieve job satisfaction or dissatisfaction based on a fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA). Most problems and theories of social science are formulated in terms of sets and set relations, while study employs asymmetric thinking in data analysis of previous linear relationships. The fsQCA found three and two causal configurations to be sufficient for high employee job satisfaction and dissatisfaction, respectively. For instance, the results indicate one configuration, namely task-related, innovation-related, coworker-related, and personal-related characteristics present but supervisor-related characteristics absent, can achieve high employee job satisfaction when the values of task-related, innovation-related, coworker-related, and personal-related characteristics are high with lower values of supervisor-related characteristics.

AB  - Indigenous Peoples have been stewarding lands with fire for ecosystem improvement since time immemorial. These stewardship practices are part and parcel of the ways in which Indigenous Peoples have long recorded and protected knowledge through our cultural transmission practices, such as oral histories. In short, our Peoples have always been data gatherers, and as this article presents, we are also fire data gatherers and stewards. Given the growing interest in fire research with Indigenous communities, there is an opportunity for guidance on data collection conducted equitably and responsibly with Indigenous Peoples. This Special Issue of Fire presents fire research approaches and data harvesting practices with Indigenous communities as we "Reimagine the Future of Living and Working with Fire". Specifically, the article provides future-thinking practices that can achieve equitable, sustainable, and just outcomes with and for stakeholders and rightholders (the preferred term Indigenous Peoples use in partnerships with academics, agencies, and NGOs). This research takes from the following key documents to propose an "Indigenous fire data sovereignty" (IFDS) framework: (1) Articles declared in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) as identified by the author and specified in Indigenous-led and allied Indigenous fire research in Australia, Canada, and the U.S.; (2) recommendations specific to cultural fire policy and calls for research in the 2023 Wildland Fire Mitigation and Management Commission report; (3) research and data barriers and opportunities produced in the 2024 Good Fire II report; and threads from (4) the Indigenous Fire Management conceptual model. This paper brings together recommendations on Indigenous data sovereignty, which are principles developed by Indigenous researchers for the protection, dissemination, and stewardship of data collected from Tribal/Nation/Aboriginal/First Nations Indigenous communities. The proposed IFDS framework also identifies potential challenges to Indigenous fire data sovereignty. By doing so, the framework serves as an apparatus to deploy fire research and data harvesting practices that are culturally informed, responsible, and ethically demonstrated. The article concludes with specific calls to action for academics and researchers, allies, fire managers, policymakers, and Indigenous Peoples to consider in exercising Indigenous fire data sovereignty and applying Indigenous data sovereignty principles to fire research.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore the coherence between sustainability conceptualization (the "what") and its implementation (the "how") in terms of implemented actions and stakeholders' interactions. The paper proposes a grid approach for the simultaneous evaluation of sustainability conceptualization and implementation.
   Design/methodology/approach - This research is based on a multiple case study conducted in ten Italian Universities. In-depth interviews with general directors and administrative staff responsible for sustainable activities have been conducted together with documents and websites analysis.
   Findings - The coherence between sustainability conceptualization and its implementation showed heterogeneity of practice. Results propose a grid approach, which highlights six different approaches to explain the connection between the "what" and the "how" of sustainability.
   Research limitations/implications - The research is focused on Italian universities and may have overlooked approaches to campus sustainability specific of other countries.
   Practical implications - Understanding the coherence between the "what" and the "how" of sustainability can provide university managers with a practical tool of analysis when approaching and evaluating the sustainable campus.
   Originality/value - While higher education scholars are widely exploring the conceptualization of a sustainable campus and its implementation, little is known about the coherence between these two realms, despite their importance to facilitate the transition of sustainability vision into real practice. This study contributes to this area by proposing a grid approach to evaluate the coherence between sustainability conceptualization and implementation.

AB  - Norwegian municipalities set citizens' wellbeing a top priority, through transparent social practices and democratic conduct of public services. In 2015, the United Nations (UN) have set a collection of 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs), which are interlinked towards achieving a sustainable future by 2030. In smart sustainable cities context, a multi-stakeholder, physical and virtual platforms are considered pivotal to achieve the UN SDGs. They are core initiator for transformative actions, endeavoring on public service excellence. This research aims to investigate the digital governance platforms utilized, by a case study Norwegian municipality, to achieve the UN SDGs; towards a smart sustainable city. An empirical systematic approach was followed. The approach commenced by the conduct of a 1) narrative review and synthesis of the literature, and the municipal strategic development documents, 2) collection of a developed semi-structured survey, and 3) interviews with the municipal decision makers (including directors, and departmental professional advisors). As part of the study, broad aspects related to municipal governance and services have been discussed with the interviewees, where effectiveness measures have been identified and prioritized. Further, recommendations for improving the municipal platforms and initiatives were identified and discussed. The municipal investigated platforms and the strategic documents have led to formulating a novel conceptual model for the behavior needed towards making a unified municipal platform. Discussion and recommendations were presented to identify future development prospects, towards achieving a transformative integrated ecosystem. Further, the research presents main concepts, to articulate organizational administrative practices, and to inform municipal stakeholders, decision makers and professionals about the existing digital platforms, while proposing a model for a unified municipal governance transformation.

AB  - The global climate crisis and the substantial greenhouse gas emissions associated with the food industry necessitate the flourishing of green initiatives in this sector. As a response, new food sources (NFS) have emerged as a means to shift consumption behaviors and enhance sustainability. However, NFS companies, often characterized by limited resources and expansion challenges, face difficulties in achieving sustainable growth. This research has the purpose to investigate the necessary capabilities for successful sustainable expansion within the NFS sector and develop a comprehensive framework that maps these capabilities to different stages of expansion. Through a multiple case study approach, encompassing 21 interviews conducted within the NFS sector, this study identifies five stages of sustainability work that act as drivers for sustainable expansion. Moreover, eight categories of capabilities crucial for achieving sustainable expansion are identified and ranked in a progressive manner, from fundamental to competitive advantage. Subsequently, the study establishes a framework that links the five stages of sustainable expansion with the corresponding capabilities, providing a practical guide for NFS companies seeking to pursue sustainable growth. This research contributes to the understanding of the NFS sector by uncovering key success factors for sustainable expansion. The findings offer valuable insights for NFS companies and stakeholders, informing strategic decision-making and fostering sustainable practices in the food industry.

AB  - Local communities collectively managing common pool resources can play an important role in sustainable management, but they often lack the skills and context-specific tools required for such management. The complex dynamics of social-ecological systems (SES), the need for management capacities, and communities' limited empowerment and participation skills present challenges for community-based natural resource management (CBNRM) strategies. We analyzed the applicability of prospective structural analysis (PSA), a strategic foresight tool, to support decision making and to foster sustainable management and capacity building in CBNRM contexts and the modifications necessary to use the tool in such contexts. By testing PSA in three SES in Colombia, Mexico, and Argentina, we gathered information regarding the potential of this tool and its adaptation requirements. The results suggest that the tool can be adapted to these contexts and contribute to fostering sustainable management and capacity building. It helped identify the systems' dynamics, thus increasing the communities' knowledge about their SES and informing the decision-making process. Additionally, it drove a learning process that both fostered empowerment and built participation skills. The process demanded both time and effort, and required external monitoring and facilitation, but community members could be trained to master it. Thus, we suggest that the PSA technique has the potential to strengthen CBNRM and that other initiatives could use it, but they must be aware of these requirements.

AB  - Decreases in bone density and pathological changes in bone structure are associated with an increased risk for fractures that can lead to significant functional impairment, pain and other complications. In the conservative management of these patients inadequate compliance is often observed. As an alternative surgical procedures are considered to achieve an immediate and long lasting pain relief and an improvement in functional impairment. As a first method for vertebral augmentation vertebroplasty using PMMA was introduced. Under the aspect of enhancing security the transpedicular approach was developed. The PMMA is usually applied bipedicular and permeates the entire vertebral body. There are different systems of several companies for vertebroplasty available. In addition, the balloon kyphoplasty (Medtronic) was introduced. In this method, at least 70% of the original vertebral body height is reached, and there will be fewer leakage of cement than with vertebroplasty. The system was varied by the developments of other companies. The results of extensive studies have confirmed the efficacy and safety of balloon kyphoplasty impressively. As a disadvantage of this method the destruction of the remaining cancellous bone structures must be considered. An alternative is the radiofrequency kyphoplasty (DFine), in which highly viscous cement is used, which can be injected with high accuracy and which connects with the cancellous bone. This will maintain the structures of vertebral bodies and will reduce the risk of PMMA-extravasations. For some time, systems are available, for those additional implants are used. A sustainable success of these different surgical procedures will be always dependent on an interdisciplinary agreed and individually adapted approach.

AB  - Health policy and systems research (HPSR) is vital to guiding global institutions, funders, policymakers, activists and implementers in developing and enacting strategies to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. We undertook a multi-stage participatory process to identify priority research questions relevant to improving accountability within health systems. We conducted interviews (n = 54) and focus group discussions (n = 2) with policymakers from international and national bodies (ministries of health, other government agencies and technical support institutions) across the WHO regions. Respondents were asked to reflect on challenges and current policy discussions related to health systems accountability, and to identify their pressing research needs. We also conducted an overview of reviews (n = 34) to determine the current status of knowledge on health systems accountability and to identify any gaps. We extracted research questions from the policymaker interviews and focus groups (70 questions) and from the overview of reviews (112 questions), and synthesized these into 36 overarching questions. Using the online platform Co-Digital, we invited researchers from around the world to refine and then rank the questions according to research importance. The questions that emerged amongst the top priorities focused on political factors that mediate the adoption or effectiveness of accountability initiatives, processes and incentives that facilitate the acceptability of accountability mechanisms among frontline healthcare providers, and the national governance reforms and contexts that enhance provider accountability. The process revealed different underlying conceptions of social accountability and how best to promote it, with some researchers and policymakers focusing on specific interventions and others embracing a more systems-oriented approach to understanding accountability, the multiple forms that it can take, how these interact with each other and the importance of power and underlying social relations. The findings from this exercise identify HPSR funding priorities and future areas for evidence production and policy engagement.

AB  - Carbon markets are crucial to attaining sustainable development objectives given the pressing need to cut greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change. China is a key player in the fight against climate change since the country emits the most greenhouse emissions globally. In light of China's carbon markets, this study evaluates the risks and mitigation strategies related to financing carbon credit projects. Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (FAHP) and Fuzzy Viekriterijumsko Kompromisno Rangiranj (FVIKOR) methodologies are used to assess carbon finacing risks and strategies for the growth of China's carbon market. The FAHP method evaluated carbon credit financing risks and sub-risks, while the FVIKOR method prioritized mitigation strategies. The findings of the FAHP method show that regulatory and policy risks, financial risks, and operational risks are the major risks in the Chinese carbon markets. To mitigate these risks, prioritizing strategies based on FVIKOR suggests that developing stakeholder relationships, financial stability, and transparency would be a practical approach to achieving efficient, productive, and sustainable carbon markets in China. The study provides practical policy implications for stakeholders involved in carbon credit financing and contributes to global climate change efforts by offering insights into carbon credit market risks and opportunities.

AB  - Background/Objectives: Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming healthcare, enabling advances in diagnostics, treatment optimization, and patient care. Yet, its integration raises ethical, regulatory, and societal challenges. Key concerns include data privacy risks, algorithmic bias, and regulatory gaps that struggle to keep pace with AI advancements. This study aims to synthesize a multidisciplinary framework for trustworthy AI in healthcare, focusing on transparency, accountability, fairness, sustainability, and global collaboration. It moves beyond high-level ethical discussions to provide actionable strategies for implementing trustworthy AI in clinical contexts. Methods: A structured literature review was conducted using PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. Studies were selected based on relevance to AI ethics, governance, and policy in healthcare, prioritizing peer-reviewed articles, policy analyses, case studies, and ethical guidelines from authoritative sources published within the last decade. The conceptual approach integrates perspectives from clinicians, ethicists, policymakers, and technologists, offering a holistic "ecosystem" view of AI. No clinical trials or patient-level interventions were conducted. Results: The analysis identifies key gaps in current AI governance and introduces the Regulatory Genome-an adaptive AI oversight framework aligned with global policy trends and Sustainable Development Goals. It introduces quantifiable trustworthiness metrics, a comparative analysis of AI categories for clinical applications, and bias mitigation strategies. Additionally, it presents interdisciplinary policy recommendations for aligning AI deployment with ethical, regulatory, and environmental sustainability goals. This study emphasizes measurable standards, multi-stakeholder engagement strategies, and global partnerships to ensure that future AI innovations meet ethical and practical healthcare needs. Conclusions: Trustworthy AI in healthcare requires more than technical advancements-it demands robust ethical safeguards, proactive regulation, and continuous collaboration. By adopting the recommended roadmap, stakeholders can foster responsible innovation, improve patient outcomes, and maintain public trust in AI-driven healthcare.

AB  - Improving environmental sustainability through purchasing and supply management (PSM) has gained increasing attention from both industry and academia. However, few attempts have been made to summarize the research development of this field. This study aims to identify the major author collaborative networks and thematic trends of this field by conducting a bibliometric review based on 371 peer-reviewed articles published between 1998 and 2017 using CiteSpace. The results show that this field is an emergent and fast-growing field which has been recognized by multiple disciplines. In terms of authors, the top ten influential authors represented by Sarkis, J., Zhu, Q.H., Vachon, S., and Klassen, R.D. were identified. Further, the four largest collaborative networks with varying research topics such as green supplier selection/evaluation and sustainable sub-supplier management were found. As for the research themes, the six largest research themes were abstracted: green supplier assessment, sustainable supplier/supply chain management, green supplier management, green supplier selection, environmental purchasing, and green supply chain management (GSCM). Further, the research thread over time was summarized as four stages: infancy stage, grow-up stage, surging stage, and deep-going stage. Finally, future research directions were given. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first systematic review of this field using bibliometric analysis, comprehensively acknowledging the current research status of this field and that of the future.

AB  - Background: While support for the idea of fostering healthy societies is longstanding, there is a gap in the literature on what they are, how to beget them, and how experience might inform future efforts. This paper explores developments since Alma Ata (1978) to understand how a range of related concepts and fields inform approaches to healthy societies and to develop a model to help conceptualize future research and policy initiatives. Methods: Drawing on 68 purposively selected documents, including political declarations, commission and agency reports, peer-reviewed papers and guidance notes, we undertook qualitative thematic analysis. Three independent researchers compiled and categorised themes describing the domains of a potential healthy societies approach. Results: The literature provides numerous frameworks. Some of these frameworks promote alternative endpoints to development, eschewing short-term economic growth in favour of health, equity, well-being and sustainability. They also identify values, such as gender equality, collaboration, human rights and empowerment that provide the pathways to, or underpin, such endpoints. We categorize the literature into four "components": people; places; products; and planet. People refers to social positions, interactions and networks creating well-being. Places are physical environments - built and natural - and the interests and policies shaping them. Products are commodities and commercial practices impacting population health. Planet places human health in the context of the 'Anthropocene.' These components interact in complex ways across global, regional, country and community levels as outlined in our heuristic. Conclusion: The literature offers little critical reflection on why greater progress has not been made, or on the need to organise and resist the prevailing systems which perpetuate ill-health.

AB  - This paper examines the strategic environmental assessment (SEA) systemic policy drivers for solid waste management (SWM) policies, plans and programmes (PPP) in Malaysia. Solid waste generation in Malaysia has been increasing drastically from 9.0 million tonnes in 2000 to an expected 15.6 million tonnes in 2020. This projected rate of solid waste generation is expected to burden the country's environmental and water quality resources. The key problem the study frames is the lack of environmental integration in the SWM process which is only conducted during the environmental impact assessments (EIA) stage of SWM facilities. The purpose of this study is to expand the SEA subject knowledge by validating a behaviour based theoretical framework and identifying key policy drivers that influence the integration of SEA in SWM policy planning. The study methodology utilized a confirmatory covariance based structural equation modelling approach to validate the proposed theoretical model based on the policy makers/implementers interview questionnaire data collection. The study findings indicate five latent SEA policy drivers which were named policy knowledge, environmental attitude, perceived benefits, perceived barriers and perceived enablers. The study has conceptualized and tested a SEA policy model which indicates that SEA integration behaviour is influenced directly by three main drivers (perception of benefits, perception of barriers and perception of enablers) and influenced indirectly by two sub-drivers environmental attitude and environmental knowledge. Furthermore, the findings also suggest that the enabler driver may be the most influential in predicting SEA integration behaviour followed by barrier driver and finally the benefit driver. In conclusion, the general study implication is that it provides an empirical based framework for environmental policy integration initiatives among policy actors while the specific study proposition is that the optimal SEA policy integration pathway may require the establishment of SEA enablers such as public participation and capacity building for the formulation of a long-term sustainable strategy for SWM.

AB  - Despite a vigorous, and year-long, debate about animal welfare in livestock farming, there is no evidence of substantial improvements having resulted for the farm animals. Aside from consistent assessment approaches, many farms lack the various resources - and the knowledge as to their allocation - required to protect farm animals against clinical and subclinical disturbances, and they also have difficulties in handling the conflicting goals pursued by the usage of farm animals, on the one hand and their protection, on the other. The performances, by farm management, of protecting as high a percentage of animals of one flock as possible against clinical and subclinical disturbances, and to reduce pain, suffering and damages is introduced, substantiated and further explained here in terms of their operability as "animal protection services". Within the farm system, this approach allows the alignment of animal protection and production services. At the same time, animal protection services can be compared between farms which can offer them as a quality service on the food market.
   To provide animal protection services, farm managers must ensure that living conditions are adapted to the needs of each animal, to prevent excessive strain on their adaptability, which would lead to disturbed animal health and behaviour. Animal protection services result from the entirety of processes which take place within a farm system. Valid statements about the protection services provided by a particular farm require a systemic, functional and result-oriented approach. Currently, it is up to the livestock farmer alone to decide on the effort and expenses invested and the level of animal protection services to be provided. This contribution concludes that only an external system, which classifies the animal protection services performed by a certain farm system, can overcome the prevailing anthropocentrism to give stakeholders involved the information and orientation they have been missing to achieve sustainable improvements of animal welfare in livestock farming.

AB  - In recent years, digital technologies represented by the Internet, cloud computing, big data, the Internet of Things, and artificial intelligence have developed rapidly and become a strong driving force for economic development. They have effectively driven manufacturing enterprises to innovate their production methods and management models and enhance their innovation capabilities. The improvement of the sustainable innovation capability of manufacturing enterprises is a complex system, which requires various types of collaborative coupling of digital transformation. Therefore, this paper constructs a comprehensive framework of sustainable innovation capability based on Complex System View, using 20 manufacturing enterprises in Dalian, China, as a sample to analyze the driving effects of digital transformation on the improvement of the sustainable innovation capability of manufacturing enterprises by using a mixture of NCA and QCA methods. The findings are: (1) A single type of digital transformation does not constitute a necessary condition for high sustainable innovation capacity, and the digital transformation of service, model and organization play a more universal role in generating high sustainable innovation capability in manufacturing enterprises; and (2) The combination of three paths can make various types of digital transformations couple and interact to achieve the high sustainable innovation capability of manufacturing enterprises in Liaoning Province, including the Pure Product Digital Transformation Driving Path, Model + Organization Digital Transformation Driving Path, and Comprehensive Digital Transformation Driving Path. In this paper, four conditional configurations are found to lead to non-high sustainable innovation capability, which can be summarized as the Process Digitalization Deficiency Type and Organization Digitalization Limitation Type. The findings of this paper have important theoretical and practical implications for making scientific and reasonable digital transformation decisions to improve the sustainable innovation capability of manufacturing enterprises.

AB  - This research focused on the organizational level of teamwork in companies in the Slovak Republic. The study helped to reveal the possibilities of sustainable management of team cooperation. Utilizing a mixed-methods approach, including quantitative questionnaires and qualitative interviews, the study examined four key areas: (1) team system and work positions in the team, (2) division of tasks in the team and tasks management, (3) team communication (external, internal), and (4) team training activities. The findings reveal a widespread use of teamwork, with a significant proportion of tasks performed by teams and many organizations exhibiting high reliance on teamwork. However, the study also highlights a dominance of traditional management practices, where team formation is primarily driven by capacity constraints, with limited support for organic team emergence. Moreover, management often retains significant control over team decision-making. The research further indicates that many employees lack adequate training in teamwork skills and principles. While teamwork is prevalent, reliance on traditional communication methods, such as face-to-face meetings and phone calls, persists, despite the potential of ICT tools to enhance collaboration. Furthermore, the effective use of ICT tools is hindered by challenges such as incompatibility between different systems and limited data accessibility. These findings underscore the need for organizations to embrace more agile and flexible team structures, invest in comprehensive teamwork training for all employees, leverage ICT tools effectively to improve communication and collaboration, and foster a culture of continuous improvement and feedback within teams. By addressing these areas, organizations can enhance teamwork effectiveness, improve employee engagement, and ultimately achieve better organizational outcomes so that they can implement sustainable approaches for organizing team collaboration.

AB  - Mainstreaming biodiversity in production landscapes ensures conservation and sustainable use of agricultural biodiversity, the key objectives of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and the projects supported by the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) Global Environment Facility (GEF). Mainstreaming integrates biodiversity in existing or new programs and policies, both cross-sectoral and sector-specific. The conventional model of agricultural production with limited diversity in production systems and use of high chemical input has taught us a valuable lesson as it is adversely impacting the environment, the essential ecosystem services, the soil health and the long term sustainability of our food systems. Using a qualitative participant observation approach, our study investigated four distinct traditional Indian production landscapes to gage (i) the farming communities' response to institutional policies, programs and agricultural biodiversity-related activities in traditional Indian production landscapes and (ii) opportunities and challenges for sustainable development in smallholder traditional Indian farming systems. Results indicate that the top-down decision-making regime is the least effective towards achieving sustainable development in traditional Indian farming landscapes and that farmers' experiential knowledge on participatory biodiversity management, maintenance and use for sustainable development are of critical importance to India's agriculture and economy. Reclaiming agriculture's spiritual roots through organic farming and locally grown food emerged as key, including the need for designing and implementing a more sovereign food system. Revisiting traditional smallholder farming under the COVID-19 pandemic and lessons learned for repurposing India's agricultural policy are also highlighted.

AB  - Purpose - The adoption of lean operational practices and independently the uptake of business practices related to sustainability and corporate social responsibility continues to grow. Past research has hinted at relationships between these two areas - suggesting that "lean is green" (e.g. Florida, 1996). The lean mantra of waste reduction and "doing more with less" is immediately apparent as delivering environmental benefits and has formed the basis of past research (e.g. Hughes, 2012). Almost all research linking lean operations or lean supply chains to sustainability issues have focused exclusively on environmental impact. The purpose of this paper is to explore the broader sustainability benefits of lean operations.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper uses a longitudinal multi-year (up to four years observation), multi-case analysis (n = 5).
   Findings - The paper reports that lean operations meet a wide range of sustainability outcomes beyond environmental benefits (including supply monitoring, transparency, workforce treatment, and community engagement). The paper specifies the internal and external policies, procedures, tools, and strategies for implementation of lean and sustainable operations management (OM). This is encapsulated in the development of a stage-based theoretical model of lean-sustainability. Further, it is proposed that lean implementation and sustainability performance are in fact interlinked.
   Originality/value - Past research on the role of lean operations in improving sustainably has focused almost exclusively on environmental benefits accruing from toolkit/workplace level waste reduction. This paper demonstrates that lean provides more than a toolkit (a philosophy and strategic direction) and that this meets a wide range of sustainable outcomes. This finding makes major contributions to conceptualising how lean operations influence sustainability outcomes. The paper develops the first integrative stage-based model of lean and sustainable OM.

AB  - The large proportions of waste generated from the construction industry have led to adverse environmental and economic impacts. Consequentially, there is a need for effective construction waste management (CWM) at construction sites. This study seeks to define Building Information Modeling (BIM) dimensions and respective conceptual interactions that shape the integration of CWM with construction management. A multi-dimensional framework is proposed that leverages BIM-based automated construction waste (CW) estimation capabilities to provide guidance on CWM applications, specifically, CW disposal scheduling, disposal cost estimation, onsite reuse, and allocation of waste bins. The framework presents interactions between these CWM applications and construction management fields-scheduling, estimation, sustainability, and site planning-to enable a strategic alignment between conventional project objectives and CWM. To demonstrate the framework, a real-world pilot project is employed for the case of concrete waste. Data used are documented and tracked from the project and interviews. The results reveal a 5.3% difference between estimated and actual concrete waste quantities. Accordingly, the expected dates for scheduling concrete waste pick-up are estimated for proposed integration into the project schedule. The study estimates savings of over $35,000 from reuse and recycling. Construction activities related to a retaining wall-requiring backfill-are identified from the project schedule as opportunities for reuse. Findings reveal that waste bins could be dedicated to waste streams with high generation rates at each construction stage. Findings from this study would serve as a guide for construction practitioners in assessing key benefits of CWM in improving the scheduling, cost, and sustainability performance of construction projects.

AB  - Modular construction (MC) has gained attention due to its potential for fast construction, reduced construction waste, and lower environmental impact while having several other issues on stimulating sustainability. The circular economy (CE) focuses on better resource management through a closed-loop system. Even though MC enhances sustainable practice, several pitfalls barricade sustainability in MC (high initial investment, design consideration, and technology challenges). Nevertheless, the synergy between CE and MC has not been investigated in past studies to address the issues in MC to achieve sustainability. This study investigates the integration of CE principles in MC to enhance sustainability. This study used a qualitative approach via the Delphi technique by conducting three semi-structured expert interview rounds with the use of a purposive sampling method. The collected data were analysed using manual content analysis. This study identified nine notable issues in MC to achieve sustainability, and all CE 9-R (rethink, refuse, reduce, reuse, repair, refurbish, remanufacture, recycle, and recover) principles could address those identified issues. Accordingly, thirty implementation strategies were recognised to fill the gap between the problems in MC and the potential of CE principles to solve the issues. The results provide insights for construction practitioners, policymakers, and researchers on integrating CE principles into MC processes to achieve sustainability goals. Ultimately, this study highlights the significance of a holistic approach by theoretically combining MC and CE principles as a benchmark for future studies. As a contribution, CE strives to make the planet a safe place to live by combatting resource depletion.

AB  - Background Primary healthcare (PHC) should be the cornerstone of equitable, efficient and high-quality healthcare in low- and middle-income countries. However, numerous challenges undermine its effectiveness in these settings.Objective To identify recommendations to improve PHC by integrating user preferences and provider capacity to deliver patient-centred and competent care in the Mendoza Province, Argentina.Design Modified RAND Corporation/University of California, Los Angeles (RAND/UCLA) Delphi method.Setting Health system of the Province of Mendoza, Argentina.Participants 32 public health experts from Mendoza.Interventions Proposals were developed from secondary data, the People's Voice Survey, an electronic cohort of people with diabetes, qualitative studies of users' and professionals' experiences and reviews of interventions in primary care.Primary outcome Experts had to evaluate proposals according to five criteria selected from the evidence to decision framework (impact, resource requirements, acceptability, feasibility and measurability).Results The 19 final recommendations emphasise policy continuity, evidence-based policy-making and standardisation of healthcare processes. Key areas include optimising healthcare processes, managing appointments for non-communicable diseases and ensuring competency-based training in PHC. Implementing performance-based incentives and improving financial sustainability were also highlighted. Other recommendations focus on the Digital Transformation Act, user participation in healthcare design and skills development for active engagement. Collaborative definitions of quality care, incident reporting systems and performance metrics are critical to improving healthcare quality.Conclusion This process provided decision-makers with contextualised information for health policy development. These interventions represent a step towards improving PHC, particularly chronic disease management, and provide a foundation for future regional research and health policy.

AB  - Approaches to manage for the sustainable use of natural and cultural resources in a landscape can have many different designs. One design is adaptive collaborative landscape management (ACLM) where research providers and users work closely together on projects to develop resources while adaptively managing to sustain or maintain landscapes in the long term. We propose that collaborative projects are more useful for achieving outcomes than integrative projects where participants merely join their separate contributions. To foster collaborative research projects to adaptively manage landscapes in northern Australia, a Tropical Savannas Cooperative Research Centre (TSCRC) was established in 1995. The TSCRC is a joint venture of major organizations involved in research and land management. This paper is our perspective on the four most important 'lessons learned' after using a ACLM-type approach for over 10 y. We learnt that collaboration (working in combination) not necessarily integration (combining parts into a whole) achieved sustainable outcomes. We found that integration across culturally diverse perspectives seldom achieved sustainable solutions because it devalued the position of the less empowered participants. In addition, positive outcomes were achieved when participants developed trust and respect for each other by embracing and respecting their differences and by sharing unifying concepts such as savanna health. Another lesson learned was that a collaborative organization must act as an honest broker by resisting advocacy of one view point over another. Finally, we recognized the importance of strongly investing in communication and networking so that people could adaptively learn from one another's experiences, understand each other's challenges and respect each other's choices. Our experience confirms the usefulness of the ACLM approach and highlights its role in the process of sustaining healthy landscapes.

AB  - The transdisciplinary research mode has gained prominence in the research on and for sustainability transformations. Yet, solution-oriented research addressing complex sustainability problems has become complex itself, with new transdisciplinary research formats being developed and tested for this purpose. Application of new formats offers learning potentials from experience. To this end, we accompanied fourteen research projects conceptualized as real-world labs (RwLs) from 2015 to 2018. RwLs were part of a funding program on 'Science for Sustainability' in the German federal state of Baden-Wurttemberg. Here, we combine conceptual and empirical work to a structured collection of experiences and provide a comprehensive account of RwLs. First, we outline characteristics of RwLs as transformation oriented, transdisciplinary research approach, using experiments, enabling learning and having a long-term orientation. Second, we outline eleven success factors and concrete design notes we gained through a survey of the 14 RwLs: (1) find the right balance between scientific and societal aims, (2) address the practitioners needs and restrictions, (3) make use of the experimentation concept, (4) actively communicate, (5) develop a 'collaboration culture', (6) be attached to concrete sites, (7) create lasting impact and transferability, (8) plan for sufficient time and financial means, (9) adaptability, (10) research-based learning, and (11) recognize dependency on external actors. Characteristics and success factors are combined to illustrate practical challenges in RwLs. Third, we show which methods could be used to cope with challenges in RwLs. We conclude discussing the state of debate on RwLs and outline future avenues of research.

AB  - During the COVID-19 pandemic, Canada faced a significant challenge addressing the demand for hand sanitizers. Despite having a thriving ethanol industry, the country was not equipped to address this need. The automative ethanol sector in Canada produces lower quality ethanol containing significant impurities that make their products unacceptable for use in hand sanitizers. Meanwhile, distilleries that produce higher grades of ethanol could not keep pace with the unprecendented demand. To address this issue, the Saskatchewan Structural Sciences Centre was employed to develop quality assurance methods for upgrading fuel-grade ethanol into higher grade alcohol, suitable for hand sanitizer. Through partnerships with various stakeholders, we successfully purified fuel-grade ethanol to comply with Health Canada guidelines. Our approach involved several strategies to enrich fuel-grade ethanol, including ozonation, alkaline salt and copper sulfate treatments, and carbon filtration. We also optimized the conditions of the distillation column to further reduce fusel oils to acceptable levels. While acetals and acetaldehyde posed a challenge in the purification process, a combination of amine treatments and optimized distillation were effective in decreasing these impurities to compliant levels. This review not only discusses the potential for Saskatchewan's ethanol producers to enrich fuel-grade ethanol to a higher quality but also highlights how the adversities of the pandemic precipitated innovative research applications. These efforts fostered collaborations between academia, government, and industry, addressing urgent needs, advancing economic sustainability, and transforming a crisis into an opportunity for rapid scientific progress and efficient resource optimization, all while promoting the principals of a circular economy.

AB  - Communities of Alaska's North Slope face increased stresses from cumulative effects of industrial development, resource use, and changing cryospheric and socioeconomic conditions. Given these multiple pressures, what avenues exist for citizens and decision makers to exchange knowledge about impacts of oil resource extraction in Alaska, and how do the successes and failures of knowledge exchange affect the resilience of the local social ecological system? We focused our research on the risk management process of Alaska North Slope oil resources, drawing on literature that has grown out of the risk society thesis and concepts of resilience science. We surveyed state and federal initiatives designed to increase local and indigenous stakeholder engagement in science and policy issues because such guidelines and regulations impact on the abilities of local peoples and communities to adapt sustainability strategies. Perceived risks and desired outcomes of stakeholders on the front lines of climate change and resource development should inform regulations that aim to anticipate future impacts and needed adaptation strategies. Integration of local values and perceptions in an adaptive risk management approach is fundamental in resilience-based ecosystem stewardship. The three case studies we have presented show that current provisions fail to equitably include the local and indigenous knowledge of Alaska's North Slope Borough communities in environmental risk mediation in proportion to the scope of risks inherent in current oil development policies. Our findings underscore the need for new, proactive risk management strategies that build on local stakeholders' rationalities on the trade-offs of risks and opportunities.

AB  - Experiments to create spaces for social-ecological transformation are multiplying. These experiments aim at transcending traditional spaces for rational deliberation, planning, and participatory decision-making. We present a methodological approach for triggering the emergence of "transformation laboratories" (T-labs), which are participatory spaces where new agency is activated in relation to a stagnant sustainability challenge to generate intentional bottom-up transformations. We applied a set of participatory research tools to elicit current perceptions and foster personal involvement in transforming the ongoing urbanization of a culturally and ecologically significant historical wetland in Mexico City. Given that the emergence of T-labs as genuine bottom-up transformative spaces involves changes at multiple levels (individual, collective, and social-ecological), our approach was designed to promote a safe space that stimulates openness and personal interaction. We posit that through enabling participants to reformulate their connections to the system, to others in the system, and to themselves, the system may be transformed from the inside out. We argue that transformation, in this sense, is essentially about how changes in perception about one's own role in the system's dynamics translate into changes in agency. Our T-lab brought in 19 agents involved in the use and management of the Xochimilco urban wetland. Through a set of research tools, we elicited and presented information that helped agents to see their social-ecological position and role and to identify the practices they share with others within specific social networks and spaces of action. We argue that the process of collaboration initiated by our application of these tools and communication of their results are key for advancing initiatives that seek to create conditions for endogenous transformations.

AB  - Climate change vulnerabilities are key environmental and social determinants of health, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa where public health and other infrastructure are not yet geared towards counteracting the potential impacts of changing climates. Health-related climate change adaptation research for sub-Saharan Africa is limited and existing research is not effectively translated into practical advice for decision makers. A World University Network (WUN) collaboration project was started in 2016 to investigate climate change impacts on non-communicable diseases (NCDs). This interdisciplinary collaboration, established through the Healthy-Polis International Consortium for Urban Environmental Health and Sustainability focuses on the intersection of health, climate and sustainability within urban environments through innovative research methods, co-production of knowledge, capacity building and intervention. NCDs like cancers, asthma, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and mental health are on the increase in sub-SaharanAfrican urban areas and can be further aggravated by climate change. If NCDs and the climate nexus are unaddressed, they will undermine achieving several of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Principally, we highlight climate-sensitive NCDs impacts on vulnerable populations, i.e. women, children, elderly, immune compromised and people with low socio-economic status, throughout their life course. We argue that interventions need to target disciplinary and sector 'intersections' for effective adaptation strategies. These interventions should be specifically linked to four SDGs, namely, SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-Being), SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities) and SDG 13 (Climate Action). We conclude with capacity development and policy guidance to strengthen sub-Saharan African countries ability to address climate-sensitive NCDs.

AB  - The integration of refugees into the labor market is crucial for their economic independence and cultural adaptation, but they often face significant difficulties due to legal, cultural, and language barriers. This paper explores the Mezze project - a distinctive social entrepreneurship initiative in Portugal that operates as a restaurant aimed at integrating refugees and immigrants from the Middle East, particularly women and young adults. Despite the promoters' lack of experience in the restaurant industry or working with refugees, Mezze has succeeded by leveraging a network of competencies to fill essential business skill gaps. Grounded in qualitative research, this study explores the importance of identifying key competencies and addressing competency gaps through a network of competencies to achieve purpose and impact. Mezze challenges the traditional notion that an entrepreneur must possess core business competencies. Instead, it demonstrates that social entrepreneurship can effectively address social problems through innovative, purpose-driven solutions and impact-alignment competencies, along with the crucial role of collaborative networks. This approach demonstrates that both social and financial sustainability can be achieved through business-oriented strategies, even when the promoters lack core business competencies. The key contribution of this article lies in showing that a committed social entrepreneur can prioritize purpose and impact by building a network of competencies across sectors. By focusing on desired outcomes, social entrepreneurs can explore innovative solutions and maximize the project's impact, proving that having the "right set" of competencies is not essential for making a meaningful difference.

AB  - This study investigated how local communities in Kazakhstan perceive, engage with, and potentially influence the adoption of carbon dioxide utilization technologies in their regions. Assess the impact of community -led initiatives on grid emission factors. In this study, qualitative interviews were conducted with community members residing in regions characterized by substantial carbon emissions or high energy consumption. These interviews delved into their levels of awareness, attitudes, and willingness to engage in local carbon reduction initiatives through the utilization of carbon dioxide. Furthermore, community workshops and focus group discussions were organized to facilitate community participation, foster dialogue about potential carbon utilization projects and enabling the collection of their ideas and concerns. Additionally, in-depth case studies were undertaken by selecting specific communities (Astana and Almaty), allowing for a comprehensive examination of ongoing local initiatives related to carbon utilization. These initiatives encompassed a wide array of community -led projects, collaborations with local industries, and grassroots innovations, providing valuable insights into community -driven solutions for carbon reduction. The survey results revealed that respondents strongly agree that communities face significant challenges in implementing carbon reduction initiatives, with concerns about funding and pessimism about the opportunities for success. However, there was optimism about the role of technological advancements in enhancing carbon reduction efforts. Also the survey showed that there is a strong consensus on the importance of community engagement in reducing grid emission factors, with a belief in the influence of active community participation. Public awareness and education are also considered key to enhancing community involvement. Confidence in community collaboration varies, with mixed levels of certainty about its effectiveness in achieving more sustainable grid emission reduction solutions.

AB  - This article discusses a business-school collaborative learning partnership in the Regional Centre of Expertise (RCE) on Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) in Greater Sendai. This partnership is further linked to a broader context of multi-stakeholder public participation in the RCE that was set up to advance the ESD agenda in the region. The authors propose a conceptual framework for multi-stakeholder, ESD-based social learning within the RCE with the aim of enabling the creation of a sustainability-literate society. This proposal is based on the results of students' prior experience in ESD activities, optimal age for ESD learning and future job choices presented in this paper, together with a reported article that the levels of sustainability of the two sectoral organizations were mixed and hence need improvement. The paper argues that it will be good to focus on bridging the business and education sectors by building ESD capacity of the children and youth in the formal education sector. It contends this could be done through collaborative learning using the government-mandated "Period of Integrated Studies" (PIS) in the Japanese primary and secondary school curriculum. Additionally, it will be appropriate for the RCE Greater Sendai Steering Committee to facilitate and coordinate the learning processes and also promote networking and cooperative interactions among the actors and stakeholders in the region. Recommendations for improvement of the learning partnerships in RCE Greater Sendai are made for consideration at the local and national policy levels.

AB  - Increasing small farmers' participation in contract farming is a key policy directive in many developing countries as a means of achieving multiple Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, only a limited number of small farmers actually participate in contract farming globally. Using the information-rich case of contract farming in oil palm cultivation in Ghana, this paper examines why small farmers choose to participate or not in contract farming. Data was collected through in-depth personal interviews and focus group sessions. We find that small farmers: (i) abstain from contract farming primarily due to unfavourable contract requirements; (ii) quit contract farming primarily because they view contract farming as an exploitative practice that lacks equity; and (iii) participate in contract farming primarily to obtain critical farm inputs and to access mainstream markets. By offering novel insights into the underlying reasons why small farmers abstain, quit, and participate in contract farming, this study will aid policymakers and contract farming corporations in formulating targeted strategies to attract and retain small farmers in contract farming. This paper broadens conceptualizations of sustainable palm oil production by integrating the voice of an overlooked, but important group of actors, small farmers. We contend that without a signficant increase in small farmers' participation in contract farming, sustainable palm oil production will remain a distant, elusive goal. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Sustainable rice systems play a crucial role in achieving sustainable development goals, particularly in countries like Sri Lanka that heavily rely on paddy production. The study aims to examine the economic, social, and environmental sustainability gaps of a rice production system at various spatial scales using the Sustainable Rice Platform (SRP) framework v2.1 and identify interventions that can address these gaps. Data for the study was collected through a structured questionnaire, which incorporated the 12 performance indicators of the SRP framework, including profitability, labor productivity, grain yield, water productivity, nutrient use efficiency, biodiversity, greenhouse gas emission, food safety, health and safety, child labor and youth engagement, and women empowerment. The survey was conducted over two consecutive cropping seasons, in 2019 dry and 2019/ 2020 wet seasons, in selected paddy fields representing three topo-sequences within the Deduru Oya irrigation project in Sri Lanka. The study's findings revealed that the rice systems' profitability ranges from 475 +/- 45 to 642 +/- 59 USD/ha across seasons and topo-sequences, and a yield gap of approximately 33% was observed. Substantial exploitable gaps were observed in labor productivity (67%-77%) and water productivity (58%-68%). Additionally, there was significant variability in nutrient use efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions due to variations in water management practices. The social sustainability of rice systems has received lower scores, particularly for health safety and women empowerment. The study attributed most of the economic and environmental sustainability gaps in the agricultural practices of cultivators, while various socio-political and cultural factors influenced the social sustainability gaps. This study offers valuable insights to policymakers and practitioners in countries with extensive rice systems, aiding their efforts toward achieving sustainable development goals.

AB  - This paper provides an analysis of the literature on transnational education to identify the key challenges and success factors for the sustainable operation of transnational higher education (TNE) programmes as perceived by key stakeholders. Probing the stakeholders' perspectives and applying a systematic approach, this study analyses 227 English-written articles retrieved from the Web of Science database published from 2000 to 2021. Key challenges identified include difficulties in managing the TNE programmes, ensuring quality assurance, adapting the curricula to the local contexts, accommodating offshore students' learning styles, creating studying environments for TNE students equivalent to those in the home institutions, ensuring preparedness of the academic staff, and facilitating the knowledge transfer in the host countries. The analysis also highlights six factors for the sustainable development of TNE programmes, including the effectiveness of the operations, the internationalization of the curricula, the transnational experience of the students, the development of the transnational staff, the existence of a proper regulatory framework in the host countries, and the development of a global systematic data collection for quality assurance. In addition, the evidence collected suggests that while the transition from domestic into a foreign programme can be rewarding, it demands appropriate planning and implementation.

TI  - Maternity waiting homes in Liberia: Results of a countrywide multi-sector scale-up
T2  - PLOS ONE
LA  - English
AB  - Objective Descriptions of maternity waiting homes (MWHs) as an intervention to increase facility delivery for women living in remote geographic areas dates back to the 1950s, yet there is limited information on the scale-up and sustainability of MWHs. The objective of this study was to describe the evolutionary scale-up of MWHs as a component of health system strengthening efforts and document the successes, challenges, and barriers to sustainability in Liberia. Methods Data were collected from a national sample of 119 MWHs in Liberia established between 2010-2018. The study used a mixed method design that included focus group discussions, individual interviews, logbook reviews, and geographic information systems. Qualitative data were grouped into themes using Glaser's constant comparative method. Quantitative data were analyzed using negative binomial regression to measure the differences in the counts of monthly stays at facilities with different funding sources and presence of advisory committee. Additionally, each MWH was geo-located for purposes of geo-visualization. Results In the years since the original construction of five MWHs, an additional 114 MWHs were constructed in 14 of the 15 counties in Liberia. Monthly stays at facilities funded by community were 2 center dot 5 times those funded by NGOs (IRR, 2 center dot 46, 95% CI 1 center dot 33-4 center dot 54). Attributes of sustainability included strong local leadership/active community engagement and community ownership and governance. Conclusion Success factors for scale-up and sustainability included strong government support through development of public policy, local and county leadership, early and sustained engagement with communities, and self-governance. A multi-pronged approach with strong community engagement is key to the scale-up and sustainability of MWHs as an intervention to increase facility delivery for women living the farthest from a healthcare facility.

AB  - Maintenance of functional ecological (or green) infrastructure is threatened by habitat conversion, fragmentation and loss, water scarcity, invasive species, climate change, resource extraction, poor policy implementation and societal inequity. Using South Africa as a case study, our transdisciplinary team identified actions likely to be effective in scaling up research and development projects that support implementation of policy about ecological infrastructure by active adaptive management. Based on expert knowledge at three scales, we analysed South Africa's opportunity to active adaptive management and to unlock investments that enhance functional ecological infrastructure. Barriers included lack of trust among actors, limited collaborative governance and integrated planning, including local partnerships; as well as a poor inclusion of evidence-based knowledge based on monitoring of landscape restoration efforts and its social and ecological consequences. Bridges include practicing transdisciplinary knowledge production, enhancing social learning among actors and stakeholders, and advocacy based on improved understanding. We propose a portfolio of place-based actions that could help to facilitate unlocking investments for functional ecological infrastructure by prioritising conservation, management and restoration through integrated cross-scale, collaborative and multi-sector spatial planning. Understanding the structure and dynamics of social-ecological systems, identifying champions, framing key messages for different audiences, and sharing failures and success stories internationally, are crucial requirements to unlock investments.

TI  - Transdisciplinary Education: Enabling the Sustainable Development Goals Using the Fourth Industrial Revolution
T2  - SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT IN AFRICA: Fostering Sustainability in one of the World's Most Promising Continents
LA  - English
AB  - More than ever before, the COVID-19 period has amplified the inequality of society. This inequality is particularly evident in South Africa and other African countries where the consumption expenditure Gini coefficient remains high. In the case of SouthAfrica, theGini coefficient measures 0.63 (2015). Despite the timespan since 1996, when this measure was 0.61, the inequality situation has thus barely changed. In 2015, South Africa became a signatory to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and in Dec. 2018, there was a call to establish the Presidential Commission on the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR). Attaining the ambition of SDGs is more likely through an intertwined approach with 4IR. This is particularly true for countries in Africa where resources are constrained, infrastructure lags that of other countries. Still, there is an opportunity, through innovation and a skills revolution, to leapfrog the journey towards the SDGs. This, however, requires human capacity; this realisation is partly an undertaking of higher education institutions. Higher education progression entails disciplinary as well as inter-, multi-, and cross-disciplinary education. Education in forms other than disciplinary education has occurred sporadically and not always by design. This manuscript, therefore, makes two contributions. Firstly, it discusses the intertwined aspect of 4IR and SDGs. Secondly, it calls for an explicit and institutional approach-transdisciplinary thinking about higher education and in favour of the SDGs. The transdisciplinary thinking then brings together the multiple lenses of the sustainable development framework to achieve the delivery of graduates who enable the realisation of SDGs.

AB  - Adequately understanding the role of context factors in the successful development of corporate sustainabilityoriented initiatives is an important step towards an integrative vision of sustainability at the organizational level. In the present research, an extensive and structured literature review enabled the identification of 19 context factors relevant for sustainability integration processes. The importance of these context factors was confirmed through a quantitative exploratory research with 156 experienced sustainability professionals from 42 different countries. The results obtained reveal that Commitment, Engagement, Information, Communication and Trust have the highest levels of perceived importance. The results also indicate that the relative importance of these context factors is higher for small and medium sized companies and for companies located in countries with lower Gross Domestic Product. The role of the context factors was analyzed on the scope of the operational stages of a strategic management framework focusing corporate sustainability integration - the Integrative Sustainability Intelligence model. The main contributions of this paper are: the identification of context factors relevant for corporate sustainability integration processes, combining the perspectives of scholars and sustainability professionals; the analysis of the role of the most relevant context factors in the strategic management of corporate sustainability integration processes, enabling the identification of pathways to promote their successful operationalization.

AB  - Community participation is increasingly embedded into environmental policy with the aim of accelerating transformative change towards sustainable management. A common approach to engaging with communities is through key stakeholders, who are still often selected ad hoc based on their activities. We tested an analytical approach for identifying distinct groups of community preferences as part of a case study to develop a community-led management plan for Blueskin Bay estuary and its catchment. We interviewed 36 community members to elicit their preferences for predefined management objectives following a standardised protocol. Using an agglomerative hierarchical analysis, we determined value-preference clusters for high-level management objectives and more specific objectives. At both levels combined, preference clusters were attributed to some of the commercial interests, such as cockle harvesting, forestry or tourism, which we also identified ad hoc based on their activities in the Blueskin Bay area. However, in addition, cluster analyses revealed five additional preference types: Urban Development Advocates, Cultural Environmentalists, Economic Environmentalists, Integrative Thinkers and those with Diverse Interests. We conclude that cluster analysis more objectively and specifically maps community preferences and, consequently, increases the robustness of collaborative environmental management processes, such as the one underway for Blueskin Bay estuary.

AB  - The COVID-19 crisis has immensely impacted the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals. The integration of the SDG in the teacher education curriculum could contribute to the intensification of the SDG which is called for among higher education institutions. Hence, this article assessed 238 randomly selected pre-service teachers' knowledge, awareness, attitudes, and behavior toward sustainability during the pandemic. The study applied correlation design through an online survey complemented with a qualitative approach. ANOVA and multiple regression were applied as inferential statistics. Students who were actively engaged in sustainability efforts during quarantine served as discussants during the Focus Group Discussion. Findings revealed that a significant relationship exists among the variables of knowledge, awareness, attitudes, and behavior toward sustainability. However, only awareness and attitudes can predict their behavior toward sustainability. Based on the illustrative examples in the qualitative results, students' attitudes and beliefs about sustainability include engaging in sustainable teaching-learning practices, project-based learning, environmental practices, introspection, and school-community collaboration. In addition, the sustainability practices of the students during the pandemic included tree planting, conserving resources, recycling, and campaigning for the environment. Utilizing the proposed SUSTAINtegrate toolkit is a useful teaching resource to incorporate the critical principle of sustainability into the curriculum. Educational institutions can promote awareness about sustainability through project-based learning and integrate sustainability into the teaching syllabus, instructional materials, and teaching-learning practices. Environmental and educational sustainability attitudes should be fostered among the students through introspection, school-community collaboration, and a value-laden sustainable society.

AB  - Social Impact Assessment (SIA) facilitates sustainable and equitable consideration of social issues in transport infrastructure planning. However, SIA practitioners face significant constraints in practice. Good SIA is effective in contributing to institutional mechanisms for holding political, bureaucratic and commercial processes accountable for social outcomes. This paper aims to better understand constraints to the assessment and management of social impacts. Drawing on interviews with expert infrastructure professionals involved in projects in Sydney (Australia), Amsterdam (The Netherlands), and internationally, this paper highlights weaknesses in the implementation of SIA, technical engineering-, time- and cost-focused project management practices, and poorly regulated, politically-driven urban governance and planning processes as key constraints. The findings suggest that overcoming those constraints cannot be the sole responsibility of EIA and SIA practitioners and there is more to be considered than practice alone. Instead, this requires an integrated approach across multi-level governance scales and the lifecycle of projects. This paper concludes that for good practice SIA to be realised as intended, systemic adjustments are needed in the planning of urban transport infrastructure, to address constraints and ensure that social impacts are considered in strategic stages and prioritised equally against other project and urban planning issues in decision-making.

AB  - Capabilities need to be built from the bottom-up. Social innovations at the grassroots seek to present new solutions to existing social problems. However, since the poor suffer from limitations on their individual capabilities and agency, they engage in acts of collective agency to generate new collective capabilities that each individual alone would not be able to achieve. The question is: how can these acts of collective agency be initiated, supported and sustained in practice? What roles can development actors (such as the state, donors and NGOs) play in supporting these acts of collective agency? Drawing on the literature on social innovation, the capability approach, participation and empowerment, the paper argues that three crucial C-processes are integral conditions for promoting successful, scalable and sustainable social innovations at the grassroots, namely: (1) Conscientization; (2) Conciliation and (3) Collaboration. By linking the individual, collective and institutional levels of analysis, the paper demonstrates the importance of individual behavioural changes, collective agency and local institutional reforms for the success, sustainability and scalability of social innovations at the grassroots. The paper acknowledges conflict, capture and cooptation as potential limitations and recognizes the role of contextual factors in initiating, implementing and sustaining social innovations at the grassroots.

AB  - Community-led sustainable tourism represents a paradigm shift that emphasizes the role of local residents in shaping tourism initiatives that not only promote environmental stewardship but also enhance local economies and preserve cultural heritage. The research focused on two rural wine destinations, Bano & scaron;tor in Serbia and Radda in Chianti, Italy, utilizing a constructivist epistemological approach to understand community-led tourism. The study aimed to assess how community involvement enhances the competitiveness of rural destinations, evaluates the social, cultural, and economic empowerment of local communities, and examines the role of community participation in sustainable tourism development. The factor analysis identified three key factors-destination competitiveness, local empowerment, and community participation-that collectively account for 86.25% of the variance in sustainable community-led tourism. This model highlights how community-led initiatives can enhance the competitiveness of rural destinations by attracting eco-conscious travelers and ensuring that economic benefits remain within the community, thus preserving local culture and traditions. Furthermore, active community participation in tourism planning is crucial for sustainability, as it fosters a sense of ownership and aligns tourism development with local values, ultimately leading to long-term benefits for both the community and the destination. To enhance competitiveness, Bano & scaron;tor must improve wine offerings, invest in marketing, and develop infrastructure while empowering local communities through tourism initiatives, ensuring that local voices are heard and tourism revenues benefit residents.

AB  - Food-security issues remain essential for decision-makers at all levels in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), and youth-oriented food-security policies in Ghana are no exception. While there are no "one-size-fits-all" policy pathways to eradicate poverty and hunger, various governments, civil society, youth groups, and citizens can afford to ignore the present food policies' status quo. This paper examines the perspective of sustainability when collaborative and open governance approaches are adopted by central governments and their sub-national departments, institutions, and agencies in youth-oriented food-security policymaking, implementation, and evaluation. The extent to which active stakeholder participation and collaboration, or the lack thereof, has either negatively or positively impacted food-security policies is another tangent this paper explores, including the sustainability of the youth-centered food-security policies in Ghana. Using qualitative documentary analysis technique through collaborative and open governance frameworks and drawing on the literature on multisectoral governance and youth-focused food-security policies, this paper identifies several disjointed youth-focused food-security intervention policies in Ghana with hazy institutional arrangements that have failed to ensure adequate implementation and assessment to promote cooperation, accountability, and transparency. The paper suggests the need for collaborative governance, effective policy monitoring, and evaluation strategies that involve government institutions, departments, agencies, civic societies, youth organizations, and citizens' commitments to food security. This research finds that collaborative strategies and active youth participation in all food-security-related policies are essential for Ghana to achieve Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 1 and 2.

AB  - Transformative change in how local governments support rural water services is required to accommodate the increasingly extreme effects of climate change on water service systems. This study explores the potential for contextualised soft systems thinking activities to prepare local government officials with responsibilities pertaining to rural water services in Nepal to shift towards more transformative thinking. First, the study presents the findings of focus group discussions in two rural districts of Nepal that identified common climate-related problems for rural water access including water shortages, contamination, and unequal burden of impacts. Second, we facilitated workshops with local government and non-government stakeholders, drawing on the focus group findings to frame the challenges for rural water linked to climate change that require local government response. We designed the workshops drawing on 'transformative spaces' concepts and included soft systems thinking activities to foster systemic perspectives. Participants learned about worldviews, leverage points, rich pictures, root cause analysis, and theory-of-change based action planning. Following the workshops, the study team participated in reflective sensemaking in which they deliberated on their experiences and notes from facilitating the workshops to assess the extent to which the participants demonstrated transformative thinking about rural water systems. The workshop approach showed promise in shifting how local government participants think about rural water services beyond technical fixes towards addressing deepseated issues. However, further work is required to foster new relationships necessary to support transformation and grapple with ethical dilemmas pertaining to power dynamics at community and government levels. Nevertheless, the approach presented here is a replicable, low-cost way to prepare local government stakeholders in Nepal for transforming their thinking and systems to ways that enable sustainable rural water service delivery under threats of climate change.

AB  - Development organizations and academic institutions have expressed the need for increased research to guide the development and implementation of policies to strengthen health systems in low- and middle-income countries. The extent to which evidence-based policies alone can produce changes in health systems remains a point of debate; other factors, such as a country's political climate and the level of actor engagement, have been identified as influential variables in effective policy development and implementation. In response to this debate, this article contends that the success of health sector reform depends largely on policy learning-the degree to which research recommendations saturate a given political environment in order to successfully inform the ideas, opinions and perceived interests of relevant actors. Using a stakeholder analysis approach to analyze the case of health sector reform in Lao PDR, we examine the ways that actors' understanding and interests affect the success of reform-and how attitudes towards reform can be shaped by exposure to policy research and international health policy priorities. The stakeholder analysis was conducted by the WHO during the early stages of health sector reform in Lao PDR, with the purpose of providing the Ministry of Health with concrete recommendations for increasing actor involvement and strengthening stakeholder support. We found that dissemination of research findings to a broad array of actors and the inclusion of diverse stakeholder groups in policy design and implementation increases the probability of a sustainable and successful health sector reform.

AB  - Green building projects (GBPs) involve multiple interdependent stakeholders, whose individual and separate concerns have different degrees of impact on sustainability management. These concerns are highly complex, subject to many uncertainties, and pose significant challenges to decision-makers during sustainability assessments, especially with regard to the social aspects of the project. As such, addressing the complexity of stakeholder concerns and optimizing the decision-making process in green building projects from the stakeholder perspective are crucial to improving practices in social sustainability management. However, to date, there is a lack of relevant empirical studies on this subject. This study proposes a decision-making model based on Bayesian networks (BN); a project network decision model is also constructed from a social sustainability perspective. A diagnostic analysis and sensitivity analysis of the constructed model identify the key stakeholder concerns that affect the social sustainability of the project. To verify its feasibility, the BN model is applied to a green building project, specifically, the Wuhan International Commerce Center, China. The results identify green design and construction, an abundance and stability of project funds, and conveniently-situated service facilities as the primary, sensitive stakeholder concerns that significantly impact social sustainability. The findings show that the BN model can be used as a long-term management decision-making tool for this project. The uncertainty problem associated with changes in sustainability levels induced by the multiplicity of stakeholders is addressed in this study. Furthermore, the findings expand the topic of social sustainability in green construction projects. These findings aid project decision-makers in managing stakeholders individually based on their various concerns, as well as improving the social sustainability of green building projects.

AB  - As technology continues to shape the landscape of education, the need for effective evaluation frameworks for sustainable technology-enhanced learning (TEL) becomes increasingly vital. This study presents an expert-opinion-based evaluation framework, utilizing Z-numbers and the fuzzy logarithm methodology of additive weights (LMAW), to assess the sustainability of TEL approaches. This framework focuses on four main criteria: cloud services compliance, cloud M-Learning essentials, system and technological advancement, and organizations management readiness. Additionally, it incorporates 17 sub-criteria to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the system. Drawing on the expertise of subject matter specialists, the evaluation framework utilizes Z-numbers to account for the inherent uncertainty and imprecision in expert judgments. The fuzzy LMAW is applied to calculate the overall scores for each criterion and sub-criterion, enabling a quantitative measure of their importance in the evaluation process. The findings of this study will contribute to the development of a robust and scientifically rigorous evaluation framework for sustainable TEL. By incorporating expert opinions and employing Z-LMAW, decision-makers and stakeholders can objectively assess the sustainability of TEL systems. This framework holds promise for informing the design and implementation of strategies to enhance the quality, compliance, and technological advancements in TEL environments.

AB  - Policies and actions that come from higher scale structures, such as international bodies and national governments, are not always compatible with the realities and perspectives of smaller scale units including indigenous communities. Yet, it is at this local social-ecological scale that mechanisms and solutions for dealing with unpredictability and change can be increasingly seen emerging from across the world. Although there is a large body of knowledge specifying the conditions necessary to promote local governance of natural resources, there is a parallel need to develop practical methods for operationalizing the evaluation of local social-ecological systems. In this paper, we report on a systemic, participatory, and visual approach for engaging local communities in an exploration of their own social-ecological system. Working with indigenous communities of the North Rupununi, Guyana, this involved using participatory video and photography within a system viability framework to enable local participants to analyze their own situation by defining indicators of successful strategies that were meaningful to them. Participatory multicriteria analysis was then used to arrive at a short list of best practice strategies. We present six best practices and show how they are intimately linked through the themes of indigenous knowledge, local governance and values, and partnerships and networks. We highlight how developing shared narratives of community owned solutions can help communities to plan governance and management of land and resource systems, while reinforcing sustainable practices by discussing and showcasing them within communities, and by engendering a sense of pride in local solutions.

AB  - To promote the resilience and sustainability of coastal social-ecological systems (SES), it is necessary to implement adaptive and participatory management schemes. Successful examples of adaptation to the rapid change in coastal SES exist, but the question of whether these cases may be scalable to other regions and contexts remains. To this end, the present study aimed to identify how successful management strategies implemented in a fishing cooperative in Baja California, Mexico, can be adapted to other coastal SES. In particular, this study aimed to understand whether adaptive co-management of Isla Natividad (IN) could be replicated in Isla Todos Santos (ITS), a biophysically similar coastal SES to IN but with different results with regard to fisheries management. We found that the resource systems and resources in both SESs were similar. However, there were substantial differences with regard to governance and resource users. In Isla Natividad, the level of organization orchestrated by the resource users has contributed to establishing rules and sanctions that have supported the sustainable use of fishery resources. On the contrary, in ITS, the number of resource users and their socioeconomic attributes have impeded the establishment of effective rules or sanctions. The results of this study suggest that the ITS governance system needs to be improved in order to adapt some of the IN management strategies to increase its adaptive capacity. To promote successful adaptive management, it is necessary to develop context-specific adaptive pathways that contribute to greater resilience in the SESs of this region and in other regions that face similar conditions.

AB  - Increased industrialization has led to unprecedented resource depletion on a global scale. The current state of affairs has compelled practitioners and academics to investigate the role of sustainable technologies in greening the operations of businesses. Previous studies have attempted to examine the number of operational aspects for their role in making firms sustainable, yet the utility of blockchain technologies is in its infancy. The role of BT in enhancing integration across supply chains has been in the limelight in the recent past. At the same time, its ability to cause sustainable supply chain performance (SSCP) in sync with the circular economy (CE) and supply chain integration (SCI) has largely remained unexplored. Therefore, this study intends to examine the association between blockchain technologies (BTs) and SSCPs through integration to fill the empirical gaps. The study was pursued to investigate the moderating role of the CE on the relationship between multiple extents of SCI and SSCP. Based on dynamic capability theory (DCT), the study considered BT a dynamic resource. BTs are used to integrate and reenergize the relationships with upstream and downstream channel members in pursuit of sustainable performance outcomes. The study opted for a cross-sectional design, where data was collected through convenience sampling from 475 managers from SMEs operating across Pakistan. PLS-SEM was used to analyze the data and to generate the required empirical outcomes. Study results favored the significant association between BT and SSCP, followed by a significant mediating role of SCI dimensions and moderating role of the CE. The study's findings propagate the utility of BTs adoption for SMEs, which holds the potential for firms to achieve system-wide integration to achieve sustainable outcomes. The given empirical investigation holds valuable insights for practitioners and scholars intending to pursue research on the subject matter.

The National Big Data Comprehensive Zone (BDCZ) pilot scheme, instituted by the Chinese government, systematically addresses seven core objectives, encompassing data resource management, sharing and disclosure, data center consolidation, application of data resources, and the circulation of data elements. This policy initiative aims to bolster the establishment of information infrastructure through big data applications, facilitate the influx and movement of talent, and propel corporate sustainable growth. Utilizing a quasi-natural experiment approach, we assess the pilot policy's influence on the digital-intelligent transformation (DIT) of manufacturing companies from a green innovation ecosystem perspective, employing datasets from 2010 to 2022, and methodologies such as Difference-in-Differences (DID), Synthetic Differences-in-Differences (SDID), and Propensity Score Matching-DID (PSM-DID). The findings indicate that the BDCZ initiative significantly fosters DIT in manufacturing companies. The policy's establishment confers benefits, including access to increased government support and innovation capital, thereby enhancing the sustainability of green innovation efforts. It also strengthens corporate collaboration, engendering synergistic benefits that improve regional economic progression and establish a conducive environment for digital development, ultimately enhancing the regional innovation ecosystem. The pilot policy's impact varies across entities, with more profound effects observed in developed financial markets compared to underdeveloped ones. Additionally, non-state-owned companies exhibit a greater response to BDCZ policy interventions than their state-owned counterparts. Moreover, manufacturing bussiness with a higher proportion of executive shareholding are more substantially influenced by the BDCZ. This article fills the research gap by using the quasi-natural experiment of BDCZ to test the impact on DIT of companies and provides inspiration for local governments to mobilize the enthusiasm of manufacturing companies for DIT.

AB  - The transition to sustainable energy systems presents a critical challenge for the 21st century, necessitating both technological advancements and transformative educational strategies to foster awareness and knowledge. Hydrogen technologies are pivotal for decarbonization, yet public understanding and acceptance remain limited. This study introduces and evaluates a novel gamified educational framework, uniquely integrating simulation-based learning, collaborative problem-solving, and adaptive instructional scaffolding to enhance hydrogen literacy and sustainability awareness. Unlike traditional pedagogical approaches, this method actively engages learners in real-world decision-making scenarios, bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical applications. This study involved adolescents aged 13-15 from two distinct educational and cultural contexts, one in Europe and one in the Middle East. A pre-post study design assessed knowledge acquisition, gamification engagement, and environmental awareness shifts. Findings reveal statistically significant improvements in technical knowledge and strong positive perceptions of gamified learning as an effective sustainability education tool across both cultural groups (Europe and the Middle East). Variations in engagement across cultural contexts suggest the need for adaptive, context-sensitive educational frameworks. While the findings indicate significant short-term knowledge gains, this study does not assess long-term knowledge retention, which remains an important area for future research. This research contributes to sustainability education by demonstrating how strategically designed gamification can foster behavioral engagement, enhance environmental literacy, and support the global energy transition agenda. This study offers a pioneering perspective on integrating interactive learning methodologies to cultivate sustainability competencies among younger generations.

AB  - The study investigates the moderating effect of board gender diversity on the relationship between environmental performance indicators (emissions, innovations, and resources) and financial performance. The study adopts a robust research design, drawing on a diverse sample of 6,104 companies operating in various countries. It employs a sophisticated panel data analysis with a fixed-effect model. The findings indicate a significant effect of environmental performance on financial performance. The results also reveal that higher gender diversity on a board is linked to lower returns on assets (ROA). Moreover, there is a positive interaction between management teams, board gender diversity, and financial performance. This study explores the relationship between corporate governance, environmental performance, and financial outcomes, offering practical insights for businesses, policymakers, and stakeholders. It also provides actionable insights for companies to align sustainability practices with financial success, enhancing their environmental stewardship and potentially improving financial performance. Policymakers can use this knowledge to design regulations and guidelines, while stakeholders, including investors and environmental advocacy groups, can use it to make informed decisions. The study's originality lies in its exploration of the moderating impact of board diversity on the relationship between firms' environmental performance and financial performance, using a large sample from different countries. As there is still a lack of consensus on the effect of environmental performance on financial performance, this study contributes to the understanding of corporate governance, environmental responsibility, and financial performance.

AB  - Purpose
   While one-third of Australians live outside major cities, there are ongoing challenges in providing accessible, sustainable, and appropriate primary health care services in rural and remote communities. The purpose of this paper is to explore a partnership approach to understanding and addressing complex primary health workforce issues in the western region of New South Wales (NSW), Australia.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The authors describe how a collaboration of five organisations worked together to engage a broader group of stakeholders and secure commitment and resources for a regional approach to address workforce challenges in Western NSW. A literature review and formal interviews with stakeholders gathered knowledge, identified issues and informed the overarching approach, including the development of the Western NSW Partnership Model and Primary Health Workforce Planning Framework. A stakeholder forum tested the proposed approach and gained endorsement for a collaborative priority action plan.
   Findings
   The Western NSW Partnership Model successfully engaged regional stakeholders and guided the development of a collaborative approach to building a sustainable primary health workforce for the future.
   Originality/value
   Given the scarcity of literature about effective partnerships approaches to address rural health workforce challenges, this paper contributes to an understanding of how to build sustainable partnerships to positively impact on the rural health workforce. This approach is replicable and potentially valuable elsewhere in NSW, other parts of Australia and internationally.

AB  - In recent decades, particularly during the outbreak of COVID-19, businesses organizations have focused on knowledge management processes in order to attain a sustainable competitive advantage by creating human and social capital as strategic leadership capabilities. This paper aims to develop an integrated conceptual and theoretical framework that connects strategic leadership capabilities, knowledge management processes, and sustainable competitive advantage for the public and private organizations within the service industry. The model approach has been used to build a theoretical framework that predicts the relationships between the variables. To support the link between them, a systematic literature review of traditional and contemporary theoretical and empirical research studies is conducted. Through the combination of the related literature, propositions are established. This conceptual research is primarily comprised of a model and assertions concerning strategic leadership capabilities, knowledge management processes, and sustainable competitive advantage. The outcomes of this study reflect that strategic leadership capabilities can accomplish sustainable competitive advantage. They also have the greatest potential to impact sustainable competitive advantage via engaging the knowledge management processes. Particularly, there are significant implications of this study. Regarding the theoretical implication, it contributes to the resource-based view, knowledge-based view, and knowledge creation theory in supporting strategic leadership capabilities, knowledge management processes, and sustainable competitive advantage. To the practical implication, the study linked the concepts of research variables for public and private enterprises within the service industry. It can also enable strategic leaders and businesses owners to participate in real-time opportunities and determine threats for achieving a sustainable competitive advantage in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. This is a preliminary study of the sustainable competitive advantage literature that includes the concept of strategic leadership as a knowledge management processes enabler for achieving a sustainable competitive advantage. Until now, there has not been any work like it in the literature, save in the qualitative style.

AB  - With charcoal set to remain an important energy source throughout Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) in the foreseeable future, this paper focuses on improving the efficiency of carbonisation as one contribution to more sustainable charcoal value chains. While the efficiency of woodto-charcoal conversion is often considered a technical matter of kiln performance, this study aims to shed light on the role of the enabling institutional context and the capacities of the players involved. We first review initiatives for enhanced charcoal production in different SSA countries. We then compare the data on carbonisation processes in two production areas in the Democratic Republic of Congo: Yangambi and the Bateke Plateau. The main findings are: 1) Large gains in wood-to-charcoal conversion rates are possible by improving carbonisation techniques, but success largely depends on the context-specific appropriateness of kiln solutions, on the capacity and awareness of producers and on the enabling institutional context. 2) Enhancing capacity among operators and other stakeholders requires efficient kiln techniques, but also raising awareness on benefits and sustainable sourcing options, building financial and management skills among producer organisations and improving transportation, handling and marketing. 3) The illegal or informal status of charcoal producers across SSA detracts from the efficiency of charcoal production processes, while an enabling institutional framework facilitates producers' access to permits and funding, provides for simple taxation with incentives for more sustainable practices and links technical requirements for carbonisation to sustainable sourcing and end-uses. The success or failure of improved kiln techniques and related socio-ecological outcomes is co-determined by solutions that include the aspects of capacity enhancement, acceptability and enabling institutions identified in this paper. Further development of these solutions in partnership with producers enhances the potential for more sustainable fuelwood value chains.

AB  - Sustainable tourism is known as an effort to prevent the negative impacts of tourism development by considering economic, social and environmental aspects. Sustainable tourism development is very important to be used as a reference in managing tourism destinations. The large tourism potential in the Bali Province has been inventoried by the Provincial Government of Bali by establishing a tourism area. However, in its development, several designated tourism areas cannot develop optimally and tend to experience a decrease in the quality and quantity of tourist visits. This paper presents transformation pathways toward sustainable tourism development in tourism areas. The general objective is to determine strategies that can be pursued in the development of tourism areas. The specific objective is to develop the best policies and scenarios in the development of tourism areas. This research was conducted in the Soka Tourism Area in Bali Province, Indonesia, which is the only strategic tourism area in Tabanan Regency, which has great potential but has not been able to develop optimally. The data obtained from the focus group discussion, as a data collection method will be analyzed using the MULTIPOL method. The results of the research show that the development of sustainable tourism areas can be carried out by preparing a clear and measurable framework. Promotion, preparation of cross-sector programs and tourism management training activities are needed as priority programs. On the policy, it is necessary to carry out effective planning as an optimal policy involving all stakeholders. In addition, the "Progressive Transformation" and "Integrated Transformation" scenarios can be considered to achieve sustainable tourism development. This study can be an important input for stakeholders in determining policies for the development of tourism areas in the research locations and can be applied in other areas that have similar characteristics.

AB  - BackgroundThere is increasing demand for health systems to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and invest in climate-resilient health care. Coordinating organizational structures and processes for reducing health system emissions presents challenges. Learning health systems, defined as systems that seek to continuously generate and apply evidence, innovation, quality, and value in health care, can guide health systems with planning organizational structures and processes to advance environmentally sustainable healthcare. The purpose of this research is to gather in-depth insight from key health system leaders and healthcare professionals to identify challenges and recommendations for planning environmentally sustainable learning health systems.MethodsEnvironmental scan methods were used, comprising jurisdictional literature review and informal discussions with key informants at one tertiary care center in Nova Scotia, Canada. Key informants were asked to describe challenges of coordinating environmentally sustainable health system structures and processes, and recommendations to advance planning for environmentally sustainable learning health systems. Deductive thematic analysis was used to categorize challenges and recommendations into seven characteristics of a learning health system framework.ResultsInformal discussions with 16 key informants provide detailed descriptions of 7 challenges and recommendations for planning and coordinating organizational structures and processes to advance environmentally sustainable learning health systems. Health system challenges include limited patient and community engagement, no systematic approach to measuring and monitoring emissions data, and limited knowledge of sustainability co-benefits and strategies for mobilizing sustainable organizational change. Recommendations include engaging patients and communities in co-creation of sustainable healthcare, monitoring of emissions data identifying high-impact areas for action, and well-coordinated leadership supporting sustainable policies, procedures, and decision-making in practice.ConclusionLearning health systems provide structure for establishing critical processes to adapt to routinely collected data through rapid cycle improvements, and operationalization of value-based health care that prioritizes health outcomes, reduction of costs, and mitigating environmental impacts.

AB  - In the coming decades, fishery resource managers and policy-makers in Pacific Island countries and territories (PICTs) will be increasingly challenged by the need to ensure food security in the context of a changing climate, increasing human pressure on the marine environment, and limited understanding of marine ecosystems and associated resources. These decision-makers must address a pressing and overarching question - how will pelagic resources and pressures on such resources change over time and space? Answering this question requires ongoing inquiry into critical dimensions of pelagic species and systems, for both the commercial tuna species that are managed by Regional Fishery Management Organizations (RFMOs), as well as nearshore pelagic fishes that support many small-scale fisheries and are managed at national and local levels. Research priorities include generating further insight into life history and physiology, oceanographic context, movement and migration, food webs, ecosystem dynamics and stock status. Concurrently, socioeconomic research is needed to tailor fisheries management strategies to local, national and regional conditions; and improve understanding of incentive structures among players in REMOs such as the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission. PI scientists and managers are ideally situated to generate new fisheries-relevant data; however, investments are needed to expand the capacity for research, management, and sustainable fisheries development within PICTs. Such capacity building can be accelerated through collaboration between PICTs, RFMOs, and scientific centers of excellence in Distant Water Fishing Nations. Without increased capacity development, this region will be adversely affected by the impacts of climate change and less able to take advantage of opportunities for economic development.

AB  - Payments for ecosystem services (PES) is one effective approach to address serious ecological degradation caused by rapid socio-economic development. However, inappropriate PES policy can cause conflicts among stakeholders. Uncovering the ecological and socioeconomic impacts of PES is crucial to achieve sustainable development. Focusing on donor-side and receiver-side impacts of PES, this study proposes a systematic evaluation framework based on improved emergy analysis and cost-benefit accounting. A garlic farm in Xizhou Town, Yunnan Province, where conflicts between local famers and government arise after enacting the garlic banning policy, is adopted as the study case. After reviewing the local garlic cultivation situation for the period of 2014-2018 and conducting site investigations, three scenarios, including Traditional Planting Mode (TPM), Alternative Planting Mode (APM) and Ecological Planting Mode (EPM), are set up and compared based on local characteristics. Results show that natural conditions, market price and cultivated land area affect emergy inputs and the overall sustainability. Both environmental load and pollution impacts have been decreased, while the overall sustainability has been significantly improved after the implementation of the APM policy. However, from per household income perspective, the results are completely opposite because per household income has been greatly reduced. EPM has remarkably increased economic and ecological benefits from both aspects compared with TPM, though is still inferior to APM in terms of total ecological impact. Several policy suggestions are proposed, including generalizing EPM, increasing compensation amount and capacity-building efforts. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - CONTEXT: Highly water-dependent agri-food systems are impacted by external shocks, revealing their vulnerabilities and stressing the need to transform them towards increased sustainability and resilience. Various disciplines and scholars highlight the role of Nature-based Solutions (NbS) in addressing societal challenges while creating sustainable and resilient contexts. OBJECTIVE: In steering transformative processes, participation is vital as a governance variable. However, motivating stakeholders' engagement with NbS uptake in decision-making requires evidence proving its potential to effectively address their direct and indirect environmental, societal, and economic concerns. This review systematically analyzed the potential of Citizen Science (CS) to overcome the barriers to NbS adoption and to drive stakeholders' attitudes towards sustainability. METHODS: Focused on water as an essential for the agri-food system, 46 articles were systematically analyzed to examine water-related NbS, locate relevant drivers and barriers of NbS and ecosystem services, including associated advantages and disadvantages. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Current research focuses heavily on NbS that benefit people, often overlooking the broader environmental benefits. While a trend towards using NbS for extreme weather events is evident, other critical areas like irrigation, groundwater management, food security, and water sanitation (WASH) need more attention. These elements are vital for sustainable and resilient agri-food systems. The literature identifies three central challenges to implementing NbS: knowledge gaps, participation, and funding. Novel participatory research methods like CS could prove pivotal in addressing NbS adoption barriers. CS in NbS can enhance engagement through improved and informed stakeholder participation while ensuring cost-effective and transparent processes of monitoring and evaluating potential success. Although NbS are gaining traction, scopes and scales of implementation must be more inclusive of various stakeholders and ecological services for the broader environment. SIGNIFICANCE: CS in NbS can promote sustainable attitudes within the individuals of the society, and by design, NbS provides a sustainable context. Upon proper alignment, CS-NbS can increase the harmony between human and natural systems, shedding light on the Resource Nexus cycle and ultimately causing a visible change in behavior within the engaged stakeholder network. This approach values and amplifies notions of inclusiveness and the incorporation of local knowledge. Living labs and mixed-method research in CS-NbS can initiate inter and transdisciplinarity, collaborative learning, knowledge sharing, and enhanced participation in decision- making while unlocking the transformative capacities of NbS and strengthening the science-policy-society interface.

AB  - Extensive and semi-extensive production based on local swine breeds such as Majorcan Black Pig, Cinta Senese, Gascon, Krskopolje and Turopolje is becoming extremely rare and on the verge of disappearing in Europe. In this context, the main aim of this study was to assess the potential feasibility of marketing strategies to act as guidelines for stakeholders along the supply chain to create and improve added value and match market demands. The sustainability of five production systems was evaluated together with 60 stakeholders representing five local swine breeds, using a World Cafe (WC) method combined with an Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP). The results showed that the proposed strategies could differ slightly depending on each system, while the product strategy was a common marketing priority for most of the stakeholders and represented all the systems evaluated. Diversifying production toward quality, innovative products, enhanced standardization, and quality labeling or seals of guarantee, such as the protected geographical indication or the protected designation of origin, would contribute to the sustainability of these chains. Advertising the storytelling of the meat products and emphasizing their healthier properties were also considered as positive strategies. To this effect, promotion should involve improving knowledge of the local systems and raising the profile of the meat products via public relations (networks, web pages, food and gastronomic events, workshops and so on) in the Hotels, Restaurants and Catering (HORECA) sector, stores selling top-quality products and local food shops. Better showcasing of these products and keeping the price in the premium segment would indirectly help the primary sector. By way of conclusion, other more developed local swine systems could be strong competitors, hence it is extremely important to effectively identify and trace all autochthonous swine breed products throughout the production chain. Furthermore, the entire chain must place greater emphasis on grazing (extensive or semi-extensive), the origin of the swine and their meat products. However, of utmost importance is cooperation between farms, firms and institutions.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this study is to examine the strategic organization-public dialogic communication practices of universities in the USA. The authors used the dialogic model of communication to explore the extent to which higher education sustainability leaders (SL) at the top 25 USA sustainable engage in relational communication strategies.
   Design/methodology/approach - The qualitative study involved semi-structured interviews with campus sustainability and student group leaders from a mix of regional areas in the USA. The authors examined the transcripts for concepts argued to exist within the dialogic model of communication from the public relations field.
   Findings - Results reveal that SL rely on dialogic communication strategies to recruit active participants, build stakeholder bridges across campus and empower individuals to have an impact within specific sustainability areas. Communicators most likely engaged in empathy, followed by propinquity, mutuality, commitment and risk of the dialogic model.
   Research limitations/implications - The authors extended the dialogic model of communication by identifying theoretical issues and scale items that can be used to measure each dimension of the model in future work.
   Practical implications - The results reveal several ways that institutes of higher education could successfully use relational strategies to promote sustainability across multiple campus groups and departments by recruiting campus ambassadors, collectively defining sustainability and sharing public progress reports.
   Originality/value - Few studies of sustainability in higher education holistically examine the relationship building practices of organizations that promote sustainability, despite the fact that communication is identified as a key factor in the successful implementation of sustainable actions.

AB  - Cities have become major contributors to sustainability problems and, in the meantime, seedbeds for sustainability transformation. Urban nature-based solutions, such as greening strategies that foster urban food production as a cross-cutting issue, promise to have multidimensional benefits for sustainable urban development. However, a conceptual understanding of interlinkages between nature-based solutions and their contribution to sustainability transformation is lacking. The goals of this study are twofold. First, to develop a conceptual model for testing multi-dimensional impacts of urban nature-based solutions supporting social-spatial, social-ecological and individual sustainable transformation. The model has been developed based on the concepts of place attachment, human-food connection and pro-environmental food behaviour. Second, the conceptual model is applied to the example of edible cities. Edible cities can be considered an innovative nature-based solution that provides multiple cobenefits by offering (free) food for urban residents in public spaces. A Principal Component Analysis of a survey among residents of Andernach (N = 380), one of the first edible cities in Germany revealed, in contrast to the conceptual three-dimensional model, a four-dimensional model with high construct validity and reliability. The model comprises a) place attachment, b) experiential and c) material human-food connection as well as d) pro-environmental food consumption. Items of internal emotional and philosophical human-food connection included within the pro-environmental food consumption scale suggested their important role in fostering sustainability. Results suggest that the edible city can be considered a strategy for increasing urban attractiveness and place identity, supporting social bonding and experiential human-food connection by using the edible areas for nature observation and recreation. However, although the residents are well informed about the edible city concept, most residents are not actively involved and rarely use the food provided by the edible city. Thus, they also could not answer questions related to cognitive human-food connection such as estimating the food's taste and health quality. To strengthen material and cognitive human-food connection, policy implications of the results propose the implementation of accompanying information and participation activities. By linking nature-based solutions with sustainability transformation, this study provides conceptual and practical implications for the multidimensional benefits of innovative urban greening strategies such as edible cities.

AB  - Background: The background of this research encompasses contemporary cultural policy issues and their factors of influence, with a special focus on cultural participation processes. The sphere of culture provides the fundamental base for reading and changing the paradigmatic paths through the contents and acts of formal and informal stakeholders. Culture is deeply interlinked with other departments of the entire economy by connections with feedback loops. The impacts of culture on the socio-economic and natural environment, as the "fourth pillar" of sustainable development, are recognized on the international level by theory, expert groups, and practice.Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to bring about a deeper understanding of participatory processes and their importance for strategic priority areas of cultural policy development.Study design/methodology/approach: Our study design included institutional analysis, starting from the regulatory framework that reflects cultural policy and its strategic goals, by involving previous relevant theoretical research including the ICET model. Another objective of the paper is to answer a range of questions. What are participation processes' main characteristics and challenges in culture and cultural policy development? Is there a relationship between these challenges? How to achieve desirable cultural and institutional integrative transformations in order to accomplish the strategic priority areas of cultural policy? We bring the conclusions based on theoretic and empirical overview of new empirical research findings based on the survey conducted in 2022 for the need of EPICA research projectFindings/conclusions: The findings of this research lead us to recognition, conceptualization and understanding of the existing participatory processes in culture, towards inspiring the future modelling of more integrative strategic and systemic solutions to reflect desirable and harmonized development.Limitations/future research: The limitations of research reflect future endeavour to contribute to reforming the field of culture (by formal and informal means) through more robust horizontal integration with other departments, to achieve sustainable and coherent effects through linking strategies, new forms of participation, decentralization, arm's length principle, and degrowth policy.

AB  - Background The need to more collaboratively measure the impact of health research and to do so from multidimensional perspectives has been acknowledged. A scorecard was developed as part of the Collective Research Impact Framework (CRIF), to engage stakeholders in the assessment of the impacts of health research and innovations. The purpose of this study was to describe the developmental process of the MULTI-ACT Master Scorecard (MSC) and how it can be used as a workable tool for collectively assessing future responsible research and innovation measures. Methods An extensive review of the health research impact literature and of multistakeholder initiatives resulted in a database of 1556 impact indicators. The MSC was then cocreated by engaging key stakeholders and conducting semi-structured interviews of experts in the field. Results The MSC consists of five accountability dimensions: excellence, efficacy, economic, social and patient-reported outcomes. The tool contains 125 potential indicators, classified into 53 impact measurement aspects that are considered the most relevant topics for multistakeholder research and innovation initiatives when assessing their impact on the basis of their mission and their stakeholders' interests. The scorecard allows the strategic management of multistakeholder research initiatives to demonstrate their impact on people and society. The value of the tool is that it is comprehensive, customizable and easy to use. Conclusions The MSC is an example of how the views of society can be taken into account when research impacts are assessed in a more sustainable and balanced way. The engagement of patients and other stakeholders is an integral part of the CRIF, facilitating collaborative decision-making in the design of policies and research agendas. In policy making, the collective approach allows the evaluation perspective to be extended to the needs of society and towards responsible research and innovation. Multidimensionality makes research and innovations more responsive to systemic challenges, and developing more equitable and sustainable health services.

AB  - The past decade has witnessed a rapid development of open government data practices and academic research. However, there is no systematic survey of existing research to understand the evolution of open government data. Such research can facilitate knowledge transfer within and across domains, and foster learning for countries in the early stages of open government data development. This study quantitively extracted the evolution trajectory of open government data based on the main path analysis method and then analysed the underlying motivations. The results show that open government data research went through four main phases and that the open government data movement has spread towards developing countries and smart cities. Different challenges and issues faced by the researchers in each phase drove the evolution of open government data research. Finally, we discuss future directions of open government data research based on our findings and recent development. There is a tendency to create sustainable open government data and smartness by employing artificial intelligence and creating data marketplaces.
   Points for practitioners
   Open government data efforts have evolved over the years into a global phenomenon. Countries have learned from each other and more and more efforts are focused on innovating with open government data by stimulating co-creation and using other incentives. The way that data are opened should focus on achieving goals like innovation, participation, transparency and accountability. There is a tendency to create sustainable open government data and smartness by employing artificial intelligence and creating data marketplaces.

AB  - The 4 August 2020 Port of Beirut blast caused material damage to an estimated 77,000 apartments located across 10,000 buildings within a 3 km radius of the blast, impacting around 300,000, people predominantly in the municipality of Karantina, which is situated adjacent to the Port of Beirut. The blast shed light on the instability and unsustainable development approach of the city of Beirut since well before the French mandate circa 1921-1940. The impact of the blast provides an opportunity to reassess the relationship between many relevant aspects of the city planning including but not limited to: the relationship of the city to its suburbs, waterfront, and city center; the lack of local planning and cross sectorial master plans; the preservation of the heritage versus the complexity of its urban development; the city growth and increased haphazard urbanization; the infrastructure/service systems that have over the years become increasingly deficient; the lack of public spaces; impacts on urban climate; and the urban divide and inequality that have only grown deeper since the blast, all of which have a combined and adverse impact on the quality of city life. This paper analyzes the most suitable indicators that one must highlight within the context of Beirut city to propose a better and sustainable quality of life with a focus on areas that were significantly impacted by the recent POB blast, namely Karantina. Examples of indicators which were analyzed include sustainable urban design, open spaces, heritage, infrastructure, and urban fabric. The results indicated that the following four main urban design features help improve the quality of life in Karantina, including: (i) connecting areas of Karantina and Mar Mkhael through the reactivation of vacant lots; (ii) reactivation of Ibrahim Bacha and El-Khodr Streets; (iii) redefining the historical El Khodr Mosque boundary and reclaiming its role as an urban landmark; and (iv) integration of classified built heritage. These parameters are necessary to improve the quality of life. The benefits of community participation are also assessed in the improvement and sustainable planning of the city of Beirut.

AB  - Societal Impact Statement The Anthropocene has seen declining biodiversity inextricably linked to our societies, values, and choices. This requires ecologists to engage with the public in ecosystems such as cities to learn from and help inform their values and experiences regarding their role in urban nature. This article presents a transdisciplinary citizen science project on spontaneous urban vegetation in the context of urban botany, art-science, and participatory research that engages with the ecology of cities. We address the interdependence of ecological and social networks, suggesting how plant ecology can become more relevant for society in the Anthropocene, while presenting a specific methodology for engaging the public with urban botany. Cities are socio-ecological systems that require new ways of thinking and engagement to successfully conserve biodiversity. In this article, we present the citizen science project Where Seeds Fall which was undertaken in the city of Zurich, Switzerland. It was developed in an "ecology with" cities approach seeking to conduct research with the humans living in the ecosystem while learning from and helping inform their values. Our project brings together the perspectives of ecologists, artists, and planners on the three themes of urban wastelands, spontaneous vegetation, and ecological connectivity. It is placed in the context of urban botany, environmental arts and participatory research. Volunteers placed trays of bare soil (without seeds) in their gardens and balconies and monitored what plants arrived and germinated. They then were able to share information about their trays (images, species lists) with one another through a spatially explicit web platform. The project was accompanied by public outreach events and artistic interventions in public space. This article presents the methodology of the project so that it can be replicated elsewhere. Based on the experiences with the project we discuss evolving transdisciplinary perspectives on wild plant biodiversity in cities.

KW  - MANAGEMENT
KW  - CITIES
AB  - The aim in mind in the construction of a zero-waste city is to recycle municipal solid waste in a more reasonable way in order to achieve the sustainable development of the urban environment. This goal is widely used internationally as a green development concept in urban management. However, when only the government takes the lead in the construction process, neglecting to engage and guide the participation of the public and of enterprises, the realization of a zero-waste city becomes challenging. Therefore, effective collaboration among all stakeholders would be a more effective approach to dealing with solid waste and creating an eco-friendly and livable urban environment. In this study, we adopted an evolutionary game model and selected three typical stakeholders-the government, the public, and enterprises-in order to examine the choice of tripartite strategies and their primary influencing factors based on prospect theory. This study found the following: (1) the selection of tripartite strategies at different stages of a zero-waste city's construction is influenced by the expected benefits and costs; (2) the government's leading role and related subsidies can promote the enthusiasm of enterprises and the public to participate in the construction of a zero-waste city; (3) tripartite participation in a zero-waste city's construction can maximize benefits, and after a sustainable development model has been established, each stakeholder can choose to participate actively, even without government intervention; and (4) the construction of a zero-waste city requires long-term exploration and practice, and China is currently in a transition period from government-led to government-directed planning. Establishing a perfect reward and punishment mechanism is beneficial in promoting the active participation of the public and of enterprises. The authors of this paper studied the game process of stakeholders at each stage of a zero-waste city's construction through prospect theory and explored the influences of important parameters on the strategic choice of each subject at the current stage by conducting numerical simulations, which has implications for the construction and sustainable development of a zero-waste city.

AB  - STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics) professions play a crucial role in transforming 21st-century society, as they contribute to developing new technologies that support the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Aligning engineering education with sustainable development requires raising awareness among students, fostering commitment among future generations of engineers, and promoting technical vocations. In this paper, an educational experience designed with these objectives is presented, in which more than 130 students from five undergraduate degrees in engineering and architecture at the Higher Polytechnic School of Zamora (HPSZ) of the University of Salamanca actively participated. To carry out the project, an online course was designed to train all participating students on general aspects of the 2030 Agenda, and research works were proposed in the ten involved degree subjects. The assessment of students' prior knowledge and learning regarding the 2030 Agenda was conducted through an objective multiple-choice pre-test and post-test. Additionally, their satisfaction with this educational experience was assessed through a questionnaire. The results revealed a considerable improvement in the students ' knowledge of the general contents of sustainable development, especially after participating in classroom debate sessions. The initial objective test showed a low average score, indicating the lack of knowledge about the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs among engineering students. However, the final objective test revealed a significant improvement of 3 points out of 10. Regarding the research works, out of a total of 91 students, 53 papers addressing complex issues related to sustainable development and current engineering solutions were presented. This approach facilitated collaborative learning and the celebration of World Engineering Day at the HPSZ. The results of the satisfaction survey demonstrated that the experience was positive for both students and faculty Furthermore, its media impact was essential for increasing engineering vocations ' visibility and social recognition.

AB  - Given the important role of green environments playing in healthy cities, the inequality in urban greenspace exposure has aroused growing attentions. However, few comparative studies are available to quantify this phenomenon for cities with different population sizes across a country, especially for those in the developing world. Besides, commonly used inequality measures are always hindered by the conceptual simplification without accounting for human mobility in greenspace exposure assessments. To fill this knowledge gap, we leverage multi-source geospatial big data and a modified assessment framework to evaluate the inequality in urban greenspace exposure for 303 cities in China. Our findings reveal that the majority of Chinese cities are facing high inequality in greenspace exposure, with 207 cities having a Gini index larger than 0.6. Driven by the spatiotemporal variability of human distribution, the magnitude of inequality varies over different times of the day. We also find that exposure inequality is correlated with low greenspace provision with a statistical significance (p-value < 0.05). The inadequate provision may result from various factors, such as dry cold climate and urbanization patterns. Our study provides evidence and insights for central and local governments in China to implement more effective and sustainable greening programs adjusted to different local circumstances and incorporate the public participatory engagement to achieve a real balance between greenspace supply and demand for developing healthy cities.

AB  - Future projections indicate an expansion for both food and energy demands, which can increase pressure on land use, while there is an urgent global need for climate change mitigation. Bioenergy is foreseen as key option to meet future energy demands and reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, however its sustainability depends on locations and regional characteristics. Simultaneously, agricultural production models that co-produce food, feed, and energy offer sustainability synergies and co-benefits, but site-specific sustainability assessments of their large-scale implementation are missing. This study presents a bottom-up approach to assess spatially explicit sustainability aspects of bioenergy-livestock integrated systems (BLI) in Brazil and shed light on their contribution to future energy demands, to climate change mitigation targets, and their impacts on selected ecosystem services, including bioenergy production, climate change mitigation, reduction of food competition, biodiversity conservation, and avoided deforestation. The proposed integration considers livestock intensification and use of biofuels by-products as animal feed supplement, taking advantage of synergies between these two value chains. The expansion of the BLI system in the Center-South region of Brazil produce up to 89 billion liters of ethanol, enough to meet future domestic ethanol demands from multiple shared socioeconomic pathways and generating surpluses for export. This production takes place on 16 million hectares of pastureland within the Sugarcane Agroecological Zoning, excluding the Amazon and Pantanal biomes, and biodiversity hotspots. BLI expansion mitigate up to 250 million tonnes of CO2eq and generate 15 billion dollars of profits. The best locations to maximize the selected ecosystem services are west of Sa similar to o Paulo, east of Mato Grosso do Sul, and the south-central region of the states of Goi ' as. This study may encourage the formulation of enhanced public policies for the integration of bioenergy and livestock value chains and guide a sustainable large-scale deployment of BLI systems.

KW  - rights-based approach
AB  - The intensifying loss of coral reefs from global climate change and local stressors has seen international commitments targeted at conservation and repair, for example the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework. Fulfilling these targets requires decisions to be made on where, when, and how to act, ultimately dictating where limited resources will be deployed. Every choice on action or inaction toward our ocean has direct and indivisible consequences not only for the health of marine ecosystems but also for the health of humans, particularly those who directly depend on marine habitats, both culturally and economically. The well-being of the environment, humans, and animals is interlinked, co-dependent, and even co-produced, as has already been acknowledged by One Health approaches, which endorse a cross- and trans-disciplinary view to health. Coral reefs epitomie how tightly intertwined ecosystem health and the fate of the human and nonhuman communities that depend on them are. A field that thus far remains poorly considered is a human rights-based approach to coral reef protection. A human rights-based approach implements human rights obligations, including the recently affirmed right to a clean, healthy, and sustainable environment, while embedding principles of accountability, nondiscrimination, participation, and empowerment for local and Indigenous communities that ensure effectiveness and meaningful stakeholder engagement. Tying the protection of coral reef ecosystems to human rights emphasises the importance of healthy ecosystems to human well-being and thus the inevitable connection between nonhuman and human life. The general failure to consider coral reef protection through a human rights-based approach is a missed opportunity to expedite reef protection while simultaneously advancing climate justice for both humans and nonhumans.
   Coral reefs are under threat worldwide from intensifying impacts of both local and global stressors. The loss of coral reefs not only threatens marine life but also the communities that depend on them. Dire predictions that at 1.5 degrees C warming, a mark which we might have already missed, the majority of warm-water coral-dominated systems will be non-existent leaves an uncertain future for coral reefs and the communities that rely on them. The well-being of the environment, humans, and animals is interlinked, co-dependent, and even co-produced, and consequently we propose the need for a human rights-based approach to coral reef protection.image

AB  - Purpose Suppliers and marketers have started planning toward postpandemic scenarios where logistics and retail will happen in a new way with the help of technological advances. This shift means new challenges for manufacturers, suppliers and retailers, and there is a need for strategic sourcing decisions for a robust supply chain system, logistics and on-time delivery system, as consumers have shown a positive change in online buying behavior. Furthermore, with digital transformation, customers are expected to not return to traditional buying. Hence, it becomes essential to identify the factors acting as enablers of online purchase behavior for sustainable digital business. This study aims to analyze the positive shifts in online purchasing by consumers, identify and model the enablers of positive transformations in online purchasing by consumers. Design/methodology/approach The interpretative structural modeling (ISM) technique is used to draw the interrelationships among the variables and their impact on online buying. A context-oriented relationship among the factors has been set up through the expert opinion technique. A total of 40 specialists have been approached for this. ISM with Matrice d'impacts croises multiplication appliquee a un classment (MICMAC) analysis was used to prioritize these drivers, identify the most critical factors and establish a driver-dependence relationship among these drivers. Findings Several significant categories of enablers like health, trust, convenience, work from home, referral buying, panic purchase and overstocking possess a strong influence on the shift to online due to the pandemic. The results will help the policymakers, suppliers, retailers, managers and practitioners with insights to plan, prepare for challenges and make decisions toward preparation and shifting to the emergent digital world. In addition, the study provides academicians scope for further research in the related area. Research limitations/implications Consumer behavior significantly impacts retail and supply chain business, as it is an interface with the customer and links between a manufacturer and a customer. This study provides an insight into the shift in purchase behavior which can help suppliers in this transition phase to be better prepared for tomorrow to achieve sustainable competitive advantage. Originality/value This study assists practitioners and researchers in understanding the interrelationships among the factors using ISM-MICMAC analysis in a realistic way rather than daydreaming with overambitious goals.

AB  - Efforts to expand the delivery of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) services are occurring in the context of increasing pressures on the environmental and resource systems on which WASH services depend. As such, it is imperative to explore how sustainability considerations can be made central to WASH initiatives in ways that strengthen both service delivery and environmental systems. This article contributes insights from a trans -disciplinary knowledge co-production process designed to bridge conceptual and practical priorities in a sectoral context - the WASH sector - with the intent to inform transformations at multiple levels from local practice through to global discourse. The co-production process was held online with a select group of WASH pro-fessionals from 10 countries. The design involved three components: engaging with worldviews and sustain -ability concepts; discussing the practical relevance of featured research studies in participant's professional roles; and co-creating ideas about desirable futures and transformation pathways. Findings from the process relate to its method, outcomes and implications for future knowledge co-production across four themes: (i) fostering self -reflection and engaging with purpose; (ii) considering sustainability across scales and contexts; (iii) generating ideas for individual and sectoral action; and (iv) reflecting on researcher power and considerations for future co-production processes. The case demonstrates the potential for co-production in a sectoral context to foster generative self-reflection, shared understandings and practical ideas for action towards sustainability trans-formations. Methodological insights suggest that future knowledge co-production proponents could beneficially emphasize purpose, work across scales and contexts, and take a reflexive approach to power.

AB  - As the importance of green governance (GG) for achieving sustainable development is generally recognized, research in this field is booming and has interdisciplinary features. Given of that, a systematic knowledge pedigree analysis is conducted based on 2342 papers related to GG from Web of Science to recognize the research status and better navigate the future research activities. First, the prolific authors, high-cited literature, geographical distribution and cooperation are carried out by using bibliometric tools to recognize the current research status of GG field. Then, the knowledge structure of GG is explained through high-frequency keyword analysis and keywords co-occurrence analysis. Next, the time zone map and strong citation bursts analysis are employed to unearth the knowledge evolution path of GG and reveal the research frontiers related to GG. Based on the above analysis, it is found that green economy, green revolution and justice are the current research hotspots of GG. Additionally, the topics of urban GG, management & performance of GG and the multi-agent to coordinately participate in the GG process are the research focuses. The research evolution of GG has experienced three periods. Through further analysis, three unique features of GG research are refined, i.e., governance agents, governance tools and governance objectives. And, a GG analysis framework contained the features of "agent-tool-objective" is constructed. Finally, four future research opportunities in this field are pointed out. This research integrates the results related to GG scattered in the literature system, which help to enrich the theoretical research of GG and guide the development of GG practice.

AB  - CONTEXT: The sustainability of the ongoing national Campaign-Based Watershed Management (CBWM) program in Ethiopia is questionable due to poor planning and implementation practices.
   OBJECTIVE: This study analyzes farmers? decision-making in the CBWM program, and mutual learning and collective decisions among local actors in Boset District - Ethiopia.
   METHODS: Role-Playing Game (RPG) was the main method of the study. In order to collect pertinent information during the game sessions, observation of farmers? behavior and group discussions were used. Descriptive statistics and qualitative analysis were employed to analyze game outputs.
   RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Results show that farmers prefer to collectively work on private farmlands rather than on communal land. Furthermore, participation of farmers in campaign works was higher under a defaultscenario (with control instruments), than under a willingness-scenario (without control instruments). In making decisions on their level of participation in campaign works, farmers followed the decisions of a fellow farmer they considered more knowledgeable. However, the participation of farmers in the maintenance of Soil and Water Conservation (SWC) structures was more or less the same under both scenarios. Both farmers? level of participation in campaign works and maintenance decisions were influenced by their proximity to the CBWM intervention areas (i.e. micro-watersheds) as well as their awareness and motivation. The commitment of local government actors was also crucial to enforce and encourage the farmers to participate in the program. Based on farmers? decisions in the RPG, none of the two scenarios simultaneously enhance the total land area covered with SWC structures and income of farmers. An important benefit of this game was that it stimulated mutual learning and collective decisions on micro-watersheds to be treated and alternative management strategies for the CBWM program. This revealed that there is a need to (1) motivate farmers through capacity building, (2) enhance the commitment of local government actors, and (3) introduce participatory planning to enhance mutual learning and collective decisions for sustainable watershed management.
   SIGNIFICANCE: While directly applicable to the study area, these recommendations and the RPG (as a toolkit) are essential to enhance the outcomes and sustainability of collective watershed management initiatives in other parts of the world.

AB  - This article draws from the concept of Shadow State to analyse the effects of tourism development in a Shadow State environment using the Okavango Delta (OD) in Botswana as a case study. The relationship between Shadow State and tourism enclaves and the resultant effects of tourism development in the OD is examined based on a qualitative approach. Results indicate the following: the creation of Shadow State in tourism development in Botswana has resulted in the creation of a tourism enclave emerging in the OD, especially core areas of the wetland; the tourism enclave is evidenced by the dominance of the tourism industry by multinational companies and investors; association of some of the multinational companies to local political and business elites; and, the increased corruption and a monopoly of tourism development by a few companies. This article therefore argues that tourism development in destination areas like the OD should aim at achieving the ideals of sustainable tourism where the industry should be more inclusive and beneficial to all stakeholders especially residents. The failure to eliminate signs of a Shadow State related to tourism development in the OD would render the ideals of sustainable tourism, which form part of the country's sustainable development agenda, fruitless.

AB  - In the past two decades, there has been ongoing development of corporate sustainability reporting frameworks to increase awareness of sustainability-related issues from various company stakeholders. At the same time, major reporting frameworks dealing with sustainability issues increasingly publish guides to support corporations' Sustainability Development Goals (SDGs) commitments. For corporations, it is challenging to use these guides to obtain the highest benefits for fulfilling corporate sustainability targets and provide valuable reporting on these for its stakeholders. This paper aims to provide a structural alignment approach and a robust alignment methodology that corporations can repeatedly use to harmonize the SDGs guides of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) to satisfy their evolving SDGs reporting challenges. The corporate sustainability assessment and reporting performance of four telecommunication companies on their SDGs commitment and their SDGs reporting challenges are examined to support them with tailor-made guidance established by aligning various SDGs guides of GRI and IIRC. The alignment process is carried out by utilizing the alignment framework and the alignment approach established by the paper. By applying the proposed alignment approach and alignment framework, the paper concludes that corporations can increase their SDGs reporting performance by satisfying their SDGs challenges with the deliverables of the SDGs guides. It adds value to strategic corporate sustainability literature by analyzing the relationship among companies' SDGs approaches in the same sector and supporting the various SDGs guides of GRI and IIRC by applying the alignment approach established in this paper.

AB  - Communities around the world have increasingly come to demand more involvement in decision making for local mining projects, a greater share of benefits from them if they are to proceed, and assurances that mineral development will be conducted safely and responsibly. At the same time, Bridge (2004) notes full legal compliance with state environmental regulations has become an increasingly insufficient means of satisfying society's expectations with regards to mining issues. There is now a recognised need for mineral developers to gain an additional 'social licence to operate' (SLO) in order to avoid potentially costly conflict and exposure to business risks. However, there is a correspondingly limited amount of scholarship specifically focused on SLO. More particularly, there is a need for research that uncovers those factors that lead to the issuance (or non-issuance) of a SLO in the complex and changeable environments that often characterise mineral development. In an effort to identify key determinants of SLO outcomes in the mining industry, this paper presents a comparative case study analysis of four international mining operations: Red Dog Mine in Alaska, USA; Minto Mine in Yukon, Canada; the proposed Tambogrande Mine in Peru; and the Ok Tedi Mine in Papua New Guinea. The analysis that is presented also makes use of insights from supplementary key informant interviews conducted by the author and the emerging literature on mining and communities. Five lessons for earning a SLO emerged from this analysis: (1) context is key; (2) a social licence to operate is built on relationships; (3) sustainability is a dominant concern for communities; (4) local benefits provision and public participation play a crucial role; and (5) adaptability is needed to confront complexity.

AB  - The fourth industrial revolution, commonly known as Industry 4.0, enables greater production efficiency, and significantly impacts economic, environmental, and social sustainability. However, Industry 4.0 adoption is relatively low in emerging countries. This study aims to understand the dynamics of Industry 4.0 adoption with regard to achieving sustainability goals. Accordingly, a comprehensive model is proposed to improve production and sustainability measures among SMEs through the digital transformation triggered by Industry 4.0. Based on simple random sampling, a quantitative study was conducted using Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) with data collected from 314 Malaysian SMEs. The results show that the effect of IT resources, management leadership, teamwork, and external support is significant with regard to Industry 4.0 adoption and sustainability, respectively. In contrast, the effect of market pressure is insignificant. Furthermore, the effect of Industry 4.0 adoption on sustainability is also significant. Finally, Industry 4.0 adoption mediates the relationships among all the success factors of Industry 4.0 and sustainability, except market pressure. The study extends the relationship between the success factors and Industry 4.0 adoption toward sustainability and empirically validates the mediating effect of Industry 4.0 adoption between the success factors and sustainability. The outcomes of the study provide valuable insights for the practitioners and policymakers and contribute to Industry 4.0 literature.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - As history shows, the nexus of Renewable energy and digitalization is transforming the future of sustainable global value chains.This study examines the comprehensive interconnection between low carbon participation in GVCs, renewable energy consumption, and digitalization in 20 countries with the highest level of digital exports from 1996 to 2023.Renewable energy (RECN) shows a negative relationship, indicating that high dependency on environment-friendly power corresponds with lessened fossil fuel byproducts involved in the procedure of participation in GVCs. Digitalization (DIGIT) illustrates a positive relation, highlighting the adverse effect of digital activities on carbon emissions from GVCs.The interactive effect of digitalization renewable energy (DIGIT*RECN) is positive, endorsing that renewable energy in digital activities advances the efficiency of digitalization in lessening carbon emissions. Economic and governance dynamics additionally impact the effectiveness of these given interventions. Strong frameworks of governance enable the renewable energy usage and adoption of digital technologies, whereas economic upgrading fasters the shift to sustainable global value chains by enabling investments in innovation and digital infrastructure. The study highlights the need for policy coordination and global collaboration in achieving the goals of decarbonization. The insights from the study presented herein are comprehensive and vital for policymakers and international organizations, pursuing to boost the global value chains sustainability.

AB  - Urban sustainability is most often measured using a series of social, economic, and ecological indicators. Assessment methods for urban sustainability typically factor in the ecological dimensions of greenspace, such as biodiversity maintenance, stormwater management, and/or air quality-yet indicator schemas that consider only the ecological dimensions largely overlook the social benefits of some types of urban greenspace, particularly community gardens and orchards. This article makes the case that the process of community formation and strengthening that occurs in shared growing spaces is an important element of urban sustainability in its own right. Based on 55 interviews of community garden advocates, policy-makers, and development professionals involved in urban agriculture planning, this article traces the widespread understanding among practitioners that shared growing spaces strengthen social as well as environmental sustainability, though the social benefits are often difficult to measure. The latter concern was most frequently expressed by urban agriculture advocates who, after involvement in the political process, perceived the need for such metrics in order to communicate persuasively with planners and policy makers. The social values of shared growing spaces, at once self-evident to garden advocates and difficult for them to demonstrate with quantitative data, may be theorized by drawing on insights from sociology: A truly sustainable city requires community coalescence among diverse citizens, and such community is fostered particularly well in shared growing spaces.

AB  - Viticulture is highly dependent on phytochemicals to maintain good vineyard health. However, to reduce their accumulation in the environment, green regulations are driving the development of eco-friendly strategies. In this respect, seaweeds have proven to be one of the marine resources with the highest potential as plant protective agents, representing an environmentally-friendly alternative approach for sustainable wine production. The current work follows an interdisciplinary framework to evaluate the capacity of Ulva ohnoi and Rugulopteryx okamurae seaweeds to induce defense mechanisms in grapevine plants. To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate Rugulopteryx okamurae as a biostimulator . This macroalgae is relevant since it is an invasive species on the Atlantic and Mediterranean coast causing incalculable economic and environmental burdens. Four extracts (UL1, UL2, RU1 and RU2 developed from Ulva and Rugulopteryx, respectively) were foliar applied to Tempranillo plants cultivated under greenhouse conditions. UL1 and RU2 stood out for their capacity to induce defense genes, such as a PR10, PAL, STS48 and GST1, mainly 24 hours after the first application. The increased expression level of these genes agreed with i) an increase in trans-piceid and trans-resveratrol content, mainly in the RU2 treated leaves, and, ii) an increase in jasmonic acid and decrease in salicylic acid. Moreover, an induction of the activity of the antioxidant enzymes was observed at the end of the experiment, with an increase in superoxide dismutase and catalase in the RU2-treated leaves in particular. Interestingly, while foliar fungal diversity was not influenced by the treatments, alga extract amendment modified fungal composition, RU2 application enriching the content of various groups known for their biocontrol activity. Overall, the results evidenced the capacity of Rugulopteryx okamurae for grapevine biostimulation, inducing the activation of several secondary metabolite pathways and promoting the abundance of beneficial microbiota involved in grapevine protection. While further studies are needed to unravel the bioactive compound(s) involved, including conducting field experiments etc., the current findings are the first steps towards the inclusion of Rugulopteryx okamurae in a circular scheme that would reduce its accumulation on the coast and benefit the viticulture sector at the same time.

AB  - Values and motivations can shape natural resource management decision-making as individuals set conservation goals based on diverse, unique backgrounds, histories, and experiences. Recent literature points to the need to understand, evaluate, and articulate practitioner values to make explicit how experiences shape their work. Our research responds to calls to explore a diverse range of values and motivations among conservation practitioners. We used a qualitative approach grounded in phenomenology to advance an in-depth understanding of how conservation and stewardship practitioners experience, acknowledge, and make sense of conservation decision-making in Maine, USA. We interviewed 21 conservation and stewardship practitioners. Our results indicate the presence of complex value systems, including strong biospheric, altruistic, eudaimonic, as well as egoistic values. These values interact and intersect with motivations for participants' careers in conservation in unique ways, driving participant actions and decision-making. Within Maine specifically, our results highlight the many areas for convergence of broad values among seemingly diverse groups that can inform opportunities for collaboration. Participants expressed various pathways to careers in conservation, where their work enables them to make a meaningful contribution to the environment and society. However in situations where personal and organizational values are misaligned, the role of organizational transparency, employee empowerment, and agency are key. Our results have implications for conservation groups seeking to achieve high employee satisfaction, as well as researchers, policymakers, and practitioners who hope to inspire individuals to take on conservation careers to create sustainable and transformative action for the future. Fostering early experiences in place, including interactions with the non-human world and local community, are important for influencing and reinforcing values and motivations for conservation action.

AB  - Stakeholder involvement plays a crucial role within Integrated Coastal Management (ICM) and is considered beneficial for gaining trust and knowledge and reducing conflicts. Nevertheless, disagreement and opposition among stakeholders and lack of manager experiences in participatory approaches have caused delays in ICM processes. A major challenge is to systematically guide target oriented discussions of heterogenic groups in order to reach consensus decisions based on sustainability objectives. Hence, this research aims to provide a stake-holder preference and planning tool that can be used to support participatory processes. For this, the DeCyDe-4-Sustainability methodology was tested and built upon. Seventeen applications with coastal experts, graduate students and stakeholders of ICM initiatives were carried out, which showed how the methodology can be adjusted and used for guiding stakeholder discussions systematically and generating a common understanding, for raising awareness about sustainability and evaluating concrete measures using success criteria. With a sound preparation, adaptation to local needs and combination with an indicator-based evaluation, the methodology can be applied to guide stakeholder involvement processes within ICM. The System Approach Framework (SAF) with its stepwise approach from the issue identification to the implementation of a solution and evaluation of success was found to serve as a suitable frame. Hereby, the modified stakeholder preference and planning tool can guide discussions from generating a general view of an area and problems therein, down to the selection and evaluation of concrete measures to tackle the problem and its effects on a larger level and contribution to a sustainable coastal development.

AB  - Values of the public are a key and dynamic component of bushfire governance SES. Learning to work with these values is a significant challenge for government and environmental managers and an important aspect of policy transition in many contexts. During such transitions, collaborative research can play a key role in social learning, but this may be particularly challenging for agencies with dominant expertise in technical and ecological domains. We examined how collaborative research supported social learning to incorporate values of the public in bushfire governance in the State of Victoria, Australia. Following disruption of a major bushfire, new policy directions were established, including greater attention to expectations and participation of communities in bushfire management. Among other actions, the state environmental agency supported this policy transition by establishing a 3-year research collaboration to better understand and incorporate values of the public in their decision making. As both participants and observers of this research, we analyzed publications, unpublished internal reports, and notes from meetings and workshops to identify how the collaborative research facilitated and constrained learning. Analysis revealed how collaborative research presents interruptions in the form of questioning of plans and routines (including of researchers), joint concept development, collection and sharing of new information, tensions within the research collaboration, idea generation building on research insights, and action research to develop new tools or frameworks. These forms of disruption operated in different ways, involving different groups of actors, levels of collaboration, and opportunities for feedback, and these in turn had implications for the forms of learning that occurred. Collaborative research also identified constraints to learning that, in some instances, set the stage for further learning, for example through capacity building and further research.

TI  - Achieving integrated care through commissioning of primary care services in the English NHS: a qualitative analysis
T2  - BMJ OPEN
LA  - English
AB  - Objectives Since April 2015, Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) have taken on the responsibility to commission primary care services. The aim of this paper is to analyse how CCGs have responded to this new responsibility and to identify challenges and factors that facilitated or inhibited achievement of integrated care systems.
   Design We undertook an exploratory approach, combining data from interviews and national telephone surveys, with analysis of policy documents and case studies in four CCGs. Data were analysed using thematic content analysis.
   Setting/participants We reviewed 147 CCG application documents and conducted two national telephone surveys with CCGs (n=49 and n=21). We interviewed 6 senior policymakers and 42 CCG staff who were involved in primary care co-commissioning (general practitioners and managers). We observed 74 primary care commissioning committee meetings and their subgroups (approx. 111 hours).
   Results CCGs in our case studies focused their primary care commissioning activities on developing strategic plans, 'new' primary care initiatives, and dealing with legacy work. Many plans focused on incentivising and supporting practices to work together and provide a broad range of services. There was a clear focus on ensuring the sustainability of general practice. Our respondents expressed mixed views as to what new collaborative service models, such as the new models of care and sustainability and transformation partnerships (STPs), would mean for the future of primary care and the impact they could have on CCGs and their members.
   Conclusions There is a disconnect between locally based primary care and the wider system. One of the major challenges we identified is the lack of knowledge and expertise in the field of primary care at STP level. While primary care commissioning by CCGs seems to be supporting local collaborations between practices, there is some way to go before this is translated into broader integration initiatives across wider footprints.

AB  - Policy making involves translating political visions into programs that seek to change a social behavior. To design these programs, decision makers must consider multiple aspects to achieve sustainable solutions. Furthermore, decision makers must manage interrelated information and preferences of different stakeholders to ensure the policy suits the community and accomplishes its goals. This research provides evidence of the applicability of the Choosing by Advantages (CBA) decision system to make environmental public policies, in particular to design a waste collection program for a city in Canada. The methodology is based on a case study where CBA was used to choose the recycling, organics, and PAYT (Pay as you throw) utility components of the program. To analyze the process, researchers measured decision makers' perceptions of levels of satisfaction or frustration during the program-design process by conducting surveys with decision-makers at different stages in time. The research also measured decision-makers' preference for applying CBA over traditional practices where no formal decision-making method is used, in terms of (1) reaching consensus and transparency, (2) making complex decisions, and (3) making faster decisions. The results show that CBA helped to include multiple aspects in designing for sustainability, and to consider the municipality and community preferences into the program. The study also evidenced that satisfaction levels increased as the process progressed. Finally, 75% of decision makers reported preference for CBA regarding reaching consensus and transparency, while this preference was milder (55%) regarding making complex decisions, and the opposite (27%) regarding making faster decisions.

AB  - The global challenges and problems that threaten sustainability and human well-being demand the provision of creative, innovative, and affordable solutions so that they are within the reach of different levels of society. From the point of view of Higher Education, this is a major challenge since it is responsible for training new generations with the competencies and knowledge that allow them to respond to contemporary challenges and problems. This study provides a framework to promote sustainable entrepreneurship through transdisciplinary and abductive thinking. This combination of approaches will allow students to identify, analyze, and understand contemporary problems and, through a systematized process based on the "design thinking" design model, propose creative, innovative, and affordable solutions that can be implemented through entrepreneurship mechanisms. The identified findings that will be presented in this work are (i) the relevance of the Education 4.0 model as a reference to promote transdisciplinarity in a current teaching-learning context, (ii) The relevance of "design for sustainable development" as a trigger for sustainable entrepreneurship, (iii) The formation of desirable competencies in the profile of the higher education student based on transdisciplinarity and abductive thinking within the active learning process, and (iv) quantitative and qualitative measurement that allows measuring acceptance and evaluation of the long-term sustainability of the solutions obtained. This work will present the implementation of the proposed framework through a case study. This case study allowed us to identify elements of the proposed reference framework. The case study will address the problem of water scarcity and pollution, describing initiatives to achieve ODS 6, where it explains how sustainable and visionary solutions can be forged through transdisciplinary collaboration and abductive thinking. The project named "STEAM-mural fountain" done by a transdisciplinary working team between academia-society-industry is described, which aims to make technological advances in water treatment and monitoring visible to society.

Such optimization process shall also consider multiple stakeholders' perspectives, interests and benefits, which remain less well investigated.ObjectivesThe study aims to integrate ecosystem services and land-use scenario analysis to design sustainable landscapes. The overall goal of spatial optimization is to explore pathways towards sustainable development.MethodsThis study uses the Mulberry-Dyke and Fish-Pond System as a representative agricultural landscape. It analyzes the spatiotemporal pattern of the landscape from 1975 to 2019. The market value method, InVEST model, and MaxEnt model are used to quantify the ecosystem services of the landscape. The analytic hierarchy process is used to set the weight of ecosystem services from the perspective of three stakeholder groups. We compare the outcomes of different scenarios and assessed through emergy yield ratio, environmental loading ratio, and environmental sustainability index.ResultsOur results indicated that: (1) The scale of the Mulberry-Dyke and Fish-Pond system decreased significantly from 1975 to 2019. (2) Among the six major ecosystem services, the average value of water purification service was the highest, while average value of mulberry supply service was the lowest. (3) Spatial optimization of the three design objectives, 'sustainably intensify', 'increase landscape multifunctionality', and 'restore ecological integrity', were primarily distributed in the study area's eastern, central, and western regions, respectively. (4) All three stakeholder-oriented scenarios showed improvements in ecological quality or agricultural output.ConclusionsOur study incorporates viewpoints of critical, diverse stakeholders in the assessment of ecosystem services and scenario analysis to establish sustainable and culturally important agricultural landscape. The framework and methods can help minimize environmental stress on the system, balance agricultural productivity and profitability, and enhance the sustainability of agricultural landscapes.

AB  - Projects and project-based activities account for over 30% of the global GPD and act as significant vehicles in the transition towards a more sustainable future. Sustainability strategies are typically enacted and implemented through projects in project-based organisations and firms. Incorporating sustainability principles into the project, product, and service management processes with successful project decision making is a challenging task and requires new personnel competencies and skills. Project sustainability management education requires the embedding of sustainability principles into project management education in a purposeful, integrative, innovative, and seamless manner. One way to facilitate this process is educational games. Active and experiential teaching methods will enable learning and practising complex project management activities in a simulative environment and are challenging at the same time. To extend knowledge of designing and using educational games for project sustainability management education, we explore the development and use of a novel educational game solution called the Project Business Game. It provides students and teachers with a computer game environment and game-based learning solution in which project planning, stakeholder management, cost management, decision making, and risk management skills can be enhanced by means of experiential, situational, and problem-based learning. The use of the game was explored in the context of educating European students of 'Junior Expert in Circular Economy' on a blended learning course in spring 2021. Action design research was applied as a research method. The results describe the requirements and goals for the instruction and the game design process based on these needs and experiences of the implementation. The findings indicate the strong suitability of using game-based learning methods to teach project sustainability management and create positive student experiences of achieving learning goals and improving engagement.

AB  - This study proposes a multi-stakeholder framework to enhance fintech use in Africa, aiming to improve financial inclusion and achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. This article analyzes past research and frameworks built to help stakeholders in developing nations adopt fintech, some of which have been tested in African states with limited success. The study recommends prioritizing national ownership, creating an enabling environment for private sector investment, partnering with multilateral development banks and other stakeholders, fostering innovation and digital literacy, and focusing on cost-effective, non-government-guaranteed financing. In accordance with the G20's High-Level Principles for Digital Financial Inclusion, a country-specific strategy can boost financial technology and digital financial services uptake in Africa. Each government may build a legislative climate that supports innovation and competition, strengthens its digital infrastructure, increases digital literacy and awareness, and collaborates with private sector stakeholders to extend financial inclusion. Partnerships with businesses, international organizations, and other nations can help The Better Than Cash Alliance (TBTCA) promote fintech adoption. Countries can use fintech companies to build and implement national digital payment infrastructure by joining the Alliance. Finally, the mSTAR program advises cooperating with USAID to promote marginalized people, incorporate digital financial services, increase public-private engagement, and educate and train policymakers, practitioners, and technologists. These ideas can help African governments adopt fintech products faster and enhance financial inclusion.

AB  - Background: The use of best practice guidelines (BPGs) has the potential to decrease the gap between best evidence and nursing and healthcare practices. We conducted an exploratory mixed method study to identify strategies, processes, and indicators relevant to the implementation and sustainability of two Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario (RNAO) BPGs at Best Practice Spotlight Organizations (R) (BPSOs).Methods: Our study had four phases. In Phase 1, we triangulated two qualitative studies: a) secondary analysis of 126 narrative reports detailing implementation progress from 21 BPSOs spanning four sectors to identify strategies and processes used to support the implementation and sustainability of BPGs and b) interviews with 25 guideline implementers to identify additional strategies and processes. In Phase 2, we evaluated correlations between strategies and processes identified from the narrative reports and one process and one outcome indicator for each of the guideline. In Phase 3, the results from Phases 1 and 2 informed indicator development, led by an expert panel. In Phase 4, the indicators were assessed internally by RNAO staff and externally by Ontario Health Teams. A survey was used to validate proposed indicators to determine relevance, feasibility, readability, and usability with knowledge users and BPSO leaders. Results: Triangulation of the two qualitative studies revealed 46 codes of implementation and sustainability of BPGs, classified into eight overarching themes: Stakeholder Engagement, Practice Interventions, Capacity Building, Evidence-Based Culture, Leadership, Evaluation & Monitoring, Communication, and Governance. A total of 28 structure, process, or outcome indicators were developed. End users and BPSO leaders were agreeable with the indicators according to the validation survey. Conclusions: Many processes and strategies can influence the implementation and sustainability of BPGs at BPSOs. We have developed indicators that can help BPSOs promote evidence-informed practice implementation of BPGs.

AB  - This research sought to establish the interdependent relationship between various factors concerning employee skills and sustainable tourism with the goal of achieving the targets set under the SDG-4. In this study, the soft and hard skills related to employability skills were the independent variables whereas sustainable tourism development was the dependent variable. The primary data were collected from 253 industry experts, including tour operators, hotel managers, travel agents, and destination marketers, offering significant perspectives on the operational intricacies and difficulties encountered within the tourism sector. Further, this research explored the importance of these factors using importance performance map analysis (IPMA). A measurement model was developed from the respondents specialized in the field of tourism. This research utilized statistical methodologies to assess the significance of various employee skills in promoting sustainable tourism. These findings demonstrate the significant impact of interpersonal, communication, competence, problem solving, and technological skills in promoting sustainable tourism. Further, it was found that competence skills had the highest importance and success in promoting sustainable tourism. These findings have significant implications for managers and stakeholders, encompassing strategic insights into workforce training, technological integration, and sustainability practices. Educational institutions should prioritize training programs that enhance the interpersonal, communication, competence, problem solving, and technology skills of their students to fulfill SDG-4. By investing in the development of these skills, educational institutions can develop a more adaptable and skilled workforce capable of promoting sustainable tourism. Novelty stems from this study's comprehensive investigation of both soft and hard skills, yielding a holistic understanding of their collective influence. This study contributes to existing knowledge by examining the relationships between skill set requirements and the educational setup in the context of the Aseer region of Saudi Arabia.

AB  - Forest restoration is critical for meeting global objectives related to climate change mitigation, biodiversity conservation and sustainable livelihoods. Recently, new technologies such as unmanned aerial vehicles (hereafter drones) have been promoted to support activities across the planning, implementation, monitoring and maintenance stages of forest restoration. Yet, there is little empirical data on how the development and application of drones are perceived by restoration managers and stakeholders and how drones intersect with existing forest social-ecological systems (SESs). Here, we investigate how drone tree planting initiatives in Australia can support ecosystem restoration. Through interviews and focus groups with key actors, we examine the opportunities and challenges that have been experienced or are foreseen with drone use. Opportunities included the ability of drones to access degraded sites that are difficult or unsafe to access on foot, for example, following bushfires, floods or landslides. They were also perceived to ease the labour shortage of bush regenerators in Australia. Drones were considered particularly useful when operating at scales of around 20-100 ha. Challenges included restrictive flying regulations that prohibit use of artificial intelligence to plot courses through complex terrain, their unproven ability to control or eradicate weeds and the uncertain supply, germination and survival rates of seeds-upon which drone-based restoration relies. Drone use may also reduce the emotional, spiritual and cultural connections of people to the land, as compared to hand-planting seeds or seedlings. We conclude by conceptualising how drone-assisted restoration can be embedded within a forest SESs management framework. Ultimately, we argue that drones offer a 'boutique' restoration approach that supports, rather than replaces, traditional forest restoration techniques.Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog.

AB  - Linkages between ecosystem services and human well-being are complex. These linkages are of particular significance to disadvantaged communities, commonly residing in marginalized rural areas, and having difficulties regarding biophysical factors, infrastructure, housing, and aging populations. In this paper, we focused on such a typical area in Southwestern China, where we examined the linkages between ecosystem services and human well-being, underpinning our investigation by the social innovation theory and a social-ecological system framework. Going beyond what has been done by other scientists, we considered the heterogeneity of beneficiaries and assessed human well-being as it was valued by people, on the ground. We did it with full realization that stakeholder evaluation is becoming a novel means and an important instrument for targeting sustainability. The identification of key stakeholders in the Wolong Nature Reserve was the first step in our research. We categorized and classified the stakeholders into groups based on their dependence on ecosystem services and their socio-economic characteristics. Significant differentiations among human well-being were found, and stakeholders with heterogeneous socio-economic characteristics had a varied dependence on specific ecosystem services. Further, the regression analysis performed revealed key factors that would mediate the level of human well-being at the local level. The factors identified included the dependence of people on regulating and cultural services, their level of education, knowledge and occupation. Our results have contributed to discerning key stakeholders for ecosystem management purposes and determining the driving factors mediating the linkages between ecosystem services and human well-being. Thus, in addition to contribution to science, the results have potential practical implications for steering a more sustainable governance of nature in areas that are similar to this typical socio-ecological system in China.

AB  - Nepal could rely on its huge renewable energy potentials to meet its energy demand sustainably. Also, renewable energy sources are considered by several national policy makers and international organizations as an engine for socio-economic development of the country, which can provide access to electricity to everybody and stimulate economic activity and economic growth. Several efforts were taken by the national government to stimulate deployment of renewable energy electricity generation capacities. However, the country is still not able to cover its energy needs with renewable energy despite decades of efforts for their deployment. The assumption of this research was that uncertainty in energy policy and planning gaps in Nepal are connected with the dominance of a limited number of discourses and ignorance of other voices which might be helpful. Nowadays, evidence exists that a multi-stakeholder and multi-sector perspective is extremely important for sustainable development. We provide evaluation of various perspectives, including technical, social, economic, environmental, and political. We collect empirical data in frames of a comprehensive stakeholders' process in Nepal. The stakeholders' preferences are analyzed through various methods of decision support sciences such as multi criteria decision analysis. To fast track hydropower development, the government has classified them into five categories based on their generation capacity. Assessment of each category and their collective comparison on multiperspectives has never been tried. Hence, such an assessment leading towards their prioritization is the objective of the study. It may help to identify a suitable strategy or policy to maximize national benefits. The study carried within the framework of five alternatives (categories) of hydropower schemes and nine different hydropower perspectives applicable in Nepalese context. The scoring method based is on secondary source evidence is applied for assessment. The study ranks medium schemes (25 to 100 MW) as best in Nepalese context.

AB  - Agricultural systems in Southeast Asia are rapidly transitioning from subsistence-oriented to market-oriented agriculture. Driven by the highly complex and variable decision processes of individual farm households, these transitions have produced a diverse landscape mosaic across the region. Elucidation and characterization of underlying decision-making processes, and the factors that influence land use choices, are thus essential for sustainable land use planning. To enable a study that seeks to understand these linkages, data on plot-level 10 year land use history, management and farm performance indicators were collected from 163 households in the Northern Lao uplands and in the Central Highlands of Vietnam, areas chosen to represent two extremes of the transition gradient. The objectives of the study were (i) to describe plot-level sequence patterns of seasonal variation of land use over several years, (ii) to apply a sequence dissimilarity metric, the complexity index (CI), to measure land use transition in an agricultural system, and (iii) to identify the key drivers of land use change and their linkages with farm performance indicators and plot level characteristics through multi-dimensional analysis. CI allowed compressing historical land use data and quantifying land use complexity in a simple and efficient manner. Land use dynamics varied strongly between the two sites, with 66% of the land use types in the Laos site being completely replaced by others during the recall periods, compared to only 15% in the Vietnam site. Associated key drivers of land use change also differed significantly: while end use of agricultural products was the main driver behind land use changes in the Vietnam site, a more complex relationship between topography and management vs. land use change was evident in the Laos site. Likewise, land use complexity does not exhibit the same relationship with farm performance in the two sites: in the Central Highlands, households with higher food availability are half as likely to transition, while in the Lao uplands, land use complexity was significantly correlated with the Progress out of Poverty index. Multidisciplinary studies remain necessary to assess the impact of innovative sustainable intensification options on system performance and environmental sustainability, before policies are enacted to support their dissemination in Southeast Asian smallholder agricultural systems. Context-specific CI thresholds associated with system quality indicators could support this by informing decision-makers on the pace of agricultural transformation and its environmental impacts.

AB  - From a climate change perspective, the governance of natural common-pool resources-the commons-is a key point in the challenge of transitioning to sustainability. This paper presents the main strategic advances of the Sao Paulo Urban Living Laboratory (ULL) regarding Food, Energy and Water (FEW Nexus) analysis and modelling at the border of a high biodiverse forest in a peri-urban region in southeast Brazil. It is a replicable and scalable method concerning FEW governance. The FEW Nexus is an analytical guide to actions that will enable a colossal set of innovative processes that the transition to sustainability presupposes. Sustainable governance of the FEW dimensions, seen as an innovation-based process, is approached by a decision making tool to understand the past and future dynamics of the system. The governance framework is based on a multi-criteria and multi-attribute set of sustainability-relevant factors used as indicators to model complex system dynamics (SD) and the stakeholders' future expectations through a Delphi approach. Based on the three main dimensions of the Ecosystem Services Approach-Physical and Material Conditions, Attributes of Communities, and Rules-in-Use-the tool comprises thirteen specific sustainability indicators such as water and carbon footprints, land use social development, payment for ecosystem services, and land use gain indices. Its development was designed to generate a long-term network of socioenvironmental stakeholders' decision making processes and collective learning about a higher level of sustainable systems. System Dynamics modelling demonstrates the associations between sustainability indicators and the impacts of payment for ecosystem services on the land use social development index, or on the trophic state index. The Delphi foresight approach, using the Promethee-Gaia method, allows us to understand the positions of multiple agents regarding the transition process. In this context, decision making tools can be very useful and effective in answering the "how to" questions of ULLs and paving the way for transition, providing collective planning and decision support frameworks for sustainability transition management.

AB  - Purpose: To develop a conceptualization of marketing strategies for sustainable development.
   Methodology/approach: When Corporate social responsibility (CSR) policies that specifically deal with issues that fall in the People and Planet domains of sustainable development, are translated in a functional marketing strategy, we speak of a marketing strategy for sustainable development (in turn the marketing strategy is an important influencing factor in the overall corporate CSR strategy). This chapter draws on literature research and insights from several subprojects within the KB3 project on value creation. The subsequent sections of this chapter set out to answer 5 questions: (1) what are marketing strategies for sustainable development? (2) Which marketing strategies for sustainable development can be distinguished? (3) Which resources such as knowledge and capabilities are associated with these strategies? (4) What is the effectiveness of these strategies? And (5) how do the strategies contribute to sustainable development? In the final section, we draw conclusions and implications for policy-makers.
   Findings: A basic basic distinction is made between responsibility strategies (in which a market offering is positioned vis-a-vis competitors on the basis of its value for society) and integrated quality strategies (in which sustainability attributes are among many other attributes that should increase the customer's overall quality perception of the offering). Firms that pursue responsibility strategies basically do the same thing as their competitors, only in a more sustainable manner, and they thus need similar resources as their competitors. Companies that pursue integrated quality strategies, are likely to favor more from a market orientation. The chapter identifies several factors that motivate companies to include sustainability attributes in their integrated quality strategies.
   Practical implications: Understanding marketing strategies for sustainable development is of key importance for policy-makers that aim to build on companies' investments and innovations to favor public (sustainable development) goals. In particular, policy-makers should align their policies with the external influences on companies, such as stakeholder pressure, opportunities for dialogue and standards, and responsible competition. Achieving sustainable development on the basis of market processes will happen by definition at the pace of market development, which may be slower than the pace that is desired by policy-makers or politicians.

AB  - Assessing pre- vs. post environmental and social effects of present irrigation projects is vital to provide sustainable socio-environmental roadmaps for the upcoming similar development projects. Such sustainability was assessed for the first time in the present study at a 20-year old irrigation and drainage network (TIDN) area in the north of Iran covering about 70 thousands ha. A 32-year period data on groundwater level and surface- and groundwater quality as well as data on harvested area and crop production was analyzed to evaluate environmental sustainability. Inverse distance weighting (IDW) method was used to prepare the zoning maps and to analyze the descriptive data. Social response to the TIDN was assessed using a cross-sectional survey through completing a questionnaire. The raw data obtained from the questionnaires were analyzed using SPSS software. During the operation of the TIDN, the cropping area increased gradually from about 34,000 ha to about 53,000 ha. In this period, the average yield of early- and late-matured rice (Oryza sativa L.) varieties, predominant crops grown in the area, increased steadily from about 5300 to 6700 kg ha(-1). Groundwater table depth declined gradually with an annual reduction of 7.5 cm mainly due to agricultural intensification. Groundwater quality parameters such as electrical conductivity, total dissolved solids, sodium, chloride, bicarbonate and magnesium decreased substantially especially in the semi-deep wells, while nitrate concentration showed a little increase without human effects. The TIDN project improved rural sustainability, hope feeling, security feeling, tourism development, cultural development, trust, social solidarity, social participation and life quality. The results indicate that similar comprehensive analyses can provide an important contribution to assess socio- environmental sustainability in irrigated catchments. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This article explores a case study of a multimethod approach to students' learning of corporate sustainability. Corporate sustainability here is seen as a comprehensive and multidisciplinary issue, closely related to Corporate Social Responsibility. The basic idea of this article proposes student learning as a joint activity with a corporate partner. Learning is therefore not only to be considered as knowledge acquisition but as mutual development of both students and partner practitioners. To integrate the diverse stakeholders, a multimethod curriculum is suggested which includes, as a central element, a playful modelling approach using childrens' building blocks. Central to this approach is the creation of a shared understanding among a multidisciplinary group to reveal individual learner's creativity with the goal of developing concrete solutions and enrichening theoretic concepts for corporate sustainability. This study is based on a review of existing learning concepts for corporate sustainability combined with conceptual models of playfulness and modelling in learning processes. In the case presented, learning activities and their outcomes are reported on from a family-owned, medium sized, industrial company in France. In the discussion, the authors engage in critical reflection on the outcomes in terms of their relevance for corporate sustainability learning by means of playful modelling and mutual development. The results indicate that the learning process provided for the students should not merely be based on passive consumption but rather on an active discourse with practice and intervention. It can be concluded that the value of the learning approach, with regard to the highly relevant and complex topic of corporate sustainability, lies particularly in the playful modelling approach, which integrates the diverse perspectives and enables multiple development through revealing the learner's creative potential, including emotional aspects.

AB  - Over 2500 airports worldwide provide critical infrastructure that supports 4 billion annual passengers. To meet changes in capacity and post-COVID-19 passenger processing, airport infrastructure such as terminal buildings, airfields, and ground service equipment require substantial upgrades. Aviation accounts for 2.5% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, but that estimate excludes airport construction and operation. Metrics that assess an airport's sustainability, in addition to environmental impacts that are sometimes unaccounted for (e.g. water consumption), are necessary for a more complete environmental accounting of the entire aviation sector. This review synthesizes the current state of environmental sustainability metrics and methods (e.g. life-cycle assessment, Scope GHG emissions) for airports as identified in 108 peer-reviewed journal articles and technical reports. Articles are grouped according to six categories (Energy and Atmosphere, Comfort and Health, Water and Wastewater, Site and Habitat, Material and Resources, Multidimensional) of an existing airport sustainability assessment framework. A case study application of the framework is evaluated for its efficacy in yielding performance objectives. Research interest in airport environmental sustainability is steadily increasing, but there is ample need for more systematic assessment that accounts for a variety of emissions and regional variation. Prominent research themes include analyzing the GHG emissions from airfield pavements and energy management strategies for airport buildings. Research on water conservation, climate change resilience, and waste management is more limited, indicating that airport environmental accounting requires more analysis. A disconnect exists between research efforts and practices implemented by airports. Effective practices such as sourcing low-emission electricity and electrifying ground transportation and gate equipment can in the short term aid airports in moving towards sustainability goals. Future research must emphasize stakeholder involvement, life-cycle assessment, linking environmental impacts with operational outcomes, and global challenges (e.g. resilience, climate change adaptation, mitigation of infectious diseases).

AB  - Recovering or threatened carnivore populations are often harvested to minimise their impact on human activities, such as livestock farming or game hunting. Increasingly, harvest quota decisions involve a set of scientific, administrative and political institutions operating at national and sub-national levels whose interactions and collective decision-making aim to increase the legitimacy of management and ensure population targets are met. In practice, however, assessments of how quota decisions change between these different actors and what consequences these changes have on population trends are rare. We combine a state-space population modelling approach with an analysis of quota decisions taken at both regional and national levels between 2007 and 2018 to build a set of decision-making models that together predict annual harvest quota values for Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) in Norway. We reveal a tendency for administrative decision-makers to compensate for consistent quota increases by political actors, particularly when the lynx population size estimate is above the regional target. Using population forecasts based on the ensemble of decision-making models, we show that such buffering of political biases ensures lynx population size remains close to regional and national targets in the long term. Our results go beyond the usual qualitative assessment of collaborative governance systems for carnivore management, revealing a system of checks and balances that, in the case of lynx in Norway, ensures both multi-stakeholder participation and sustainable harvest quotas. Nevertheless, we highlight important inter-regional differences in decision-making and population forecasts, the socio-ecological drivers of which need to be better understood to prevent future population declines. Synthesis and applications. Our work analyses the sequence of decisions leading to yearly quotas for lynx harvest in Norway, highlighting the collaborative and structural processes that together shape harvest sustainability. In doing so, we provide a predictive framework to evaluate participatory decision-making processes in wildlife management, paving the way for scientists and decision-makers to collaborate more widely in identifying where decision biases might lie and how institutional arrangements can be optimised to minimise them. We emphasise, however, that this is only possible if wildlife management decisions are documented and transparent.

AB  - Considerable uncertainties remain about magnitude and character, if not general direction of anthropogenic climate change. Global mean temperature could increase by 1.5-4.5 degrees C or more over historic levels, and extreme weather eventsdrought, storms, and floodingare likely to increase greatly in frequency. Although ecologists and foresters agree that the practice of forestry will be transformed under climate change, these uncertainties compound the challenge of achieving sustainable, adaptive forest management. In this aritcle, we (i) present a multidisciplinary synthesis of current knowledge of responses of temperate and boreal tree species and forest communities to climate change, and (ii) outline silvicultural strategies for adapting temperate and boreal forests to confront climate change. Our knowledge synthesis proceeds through critical appraisals of efforts to model future tree distributions and responses to climate change, and reviews physiological, phenological, acclimation, and epigenetic responses to climate. As is the case of climate change itself, there are numerous uncertainties about tree species and provenance responses to climate change. For example, acclimation of respiration and epigenetic conditioning of seed embryos has the potential to buffer species against limited warming. Provenances within species also display idiosyncratic responses to altered climates, implying that soemm varieties will be more resilient or resistant to climate change than others. Genetically determined limits to climatic tolerance, and the limits of tree community resistance and resilience (speed of recovery from disturbance) in the face of climate-related disturbances are largely unknown. These unknowns require managers to adopt a portfolio of silvicultural strategies, which may range from minor modifications of current practices to design of novel multi-species stands that may have no historical analogue. Forest managers must be prepared to respond nimbly as they develop, incorporate new insights about climate change and species responses to warming into their practices. Marshalling all strategies and sources of knowledge should enable forest managers to mount (at least) a partially successful response to the challenges of climate change.

AB  - Urban development planning is the process of developing long-range policies for the future of a region, taking into consideration technical, political, social and environmental aspects. The need to incorporate the prementioned aspects, resulted in the increasing use of multicriteria approaches. One of the most common problems of urban development planning is to choose among various alternative projects. Motivated by the sustainable utilization of Athens' Hellinikon airport, this paper proposes a methodology for the selection of the best solution for the development of the urban site under certain preconditions. The main purpose of this multicriteria methodology is to assess five alternative investment proposals for the development of the urban site. Since local policy makers are considered to be the stakeholders, the implemented evaluation method includes several criteria that are based on three main categories: economy, environment and society. The selected criteria represent relevant, controllable and measurable elements and could be used as sustainable development indicators. A questionnaire is designed to gather information from stakeholders to evaluate the degree of influence of each indicator on the selection of the proposals. A sensitivity analysis has been carried out giving different preferences from the stakeholders. This paper offers an evaluation framework based on a blend of three types of approaches, the additive value model, the Electre III and the Promethee II. The three methods have been developed in the past, however, this paper tries to offer a cohesive framework, which can be used for the evaluation of urban development proposals in the light of economic, environmental and social criteria. The results obtained by the multicriteria evaluation method showed that the alternative proposals including the exploitation of the examined region in all land uses, marked the best performances in almost all the criteria.

AB  - Purpose - This article is based on the hypothesis that distributed and ecological leadership by the school institution and agents involved contributes to the creation, further development and sustainability of learning ecosystems. With this premise in mind, the main research question was: What are the main dimensions for developing learning ecosystems from an ecological perspective focused on school leadership? Thus, the purpose of this article is to identify and analyze school leadership dimensions from an ecological perspective within the context of flourishing learning ecosystems. The specific aims are to test the significance of and empirically illustrate those dimensions and/or conditions considered to nurture learning ecosystems. Design/methodology/approach - Drawing on notions of system, distributed and ecological leadership, the article presents a theoretical approach for examining ecological leadership. The framework is tested and illustrated in two case studies developed in Reggio Emilia (Italy) and El Prat de Llobregat, Catalonia (Spain), respectively. The data consist of semi-structured interviews and focus group interviews involving school principals, educators and program coordinators from the two municipalities. Findings - Based on the literature review and empirical work carried out, three conditions are suggested and illustrated for creating, developing and sustaining learning ecosystems: (1) cultural conditions (shared purpose and view, ecosystem engagement, shared knowledge and organizational changes); (2) social conditions (social capital, trust and interdependence-collaborative culture) and (3) material conditions (time, infrastructure and sustainability). Practical implications - The findings have practical implications for understanding the conditions needed for an ecological leadership that nurtures thriving learning ecosystems throughout the school and local communities. Originality/value - This article adopts an ecological perspective on school leadership that challenges more traditional perspectives emphasizing individual leadership (school leaders) and identifies three core dimensions that characterize school leadership in the context of socio-educational ecosystems connecting school and local community. This approach is illustrated through two cases carried out in Reggio Emilia, Italy, and Catalonia, Spain, respectively.

AB  - Finding new, creative ways to improve the performance of their supply chains is one of the biggest problems that manufacturing organizations confront in the age of globalization and competition. To achieve better performance, companies should engage in networking activities such as integrating with other supply chain participants. Manufacturing businesses also face sustainability issues caused by suppliers' practices that fail to meet sustainability criteria. In this sense, developing a collaborative relationship with a supplier is essential for successfully implementing sustainable practices and gaining a competitive edge. Therefore, it is imperative for manufacturing companies to effectively manage their relationships with their suppliers by strengthening their suppliers' commitment to sustainability. The concept of sustainable supplier collaboration (SSC) emerges from the combination of sustainability and supplier relationship building. SSC, in general, broadens the traditional supplier management system by incorporating long-term partnerships into the sustainable aspects. Companies have begun to acknowledge the value of SSC and are taking initiatives in this regard. The adoption has been extremely slow, despite the assurances of sustainable collaboration with suppliers. Hence, research is required to determine how supplier collaboration with economic, environmental, and social promises has been hindered. It is important to acknowledge any hurdles that manufacturing organizations may have while developing SSC. Also, a thorough analysis of these barriers is essential so effective and sustainable collaboration with suppliers can be achieved. Therefore, the primary goal of the study is to identify and analyze barriers to sustainable collaboration with suppliers. The integrated methodology of Total Interpretive Structural Modelling-Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (TISM-DEMATEL) is used to achieve the purpose of study. An extreme case scenario involving one manufacturer of home appliances and its suppliers is used in a dyadic India based case study. The findings of this study reveal that the most significant barriers to SSC are lack of manufacturer-supplier communications for sustainable standards and appropriate regulations, lack of trust between manufacturer and supplier, lack of scope and focus for sustainable collaboration, unwillingness to share risks and rewards, lack of top management involvement, lack of combined training programs, and lack of consistent and adequate performance measurement systems. These barriers not only contribute directly to hindering SSC efforts but also influence other barriers at intermediate and lower levels. Additionally, the study offers detailed explanations of each barrier, thereby providing valuable insights for better understanding and effective implementation of sustainable manufacturer-supplier collaboration (SMSC).

AB  - The crisis in small-scale fisheries (SSFs) is worsened by weak governance structures, requiring urgent transformation. Participatory arrangements like co-management offer potential to enhance resilience in these social ecological systems. However, the performance of collaborative governance modes must be evaluated to support institutional learning, refine governance structures, and ensure the legitimacy of transformative changes. In Uruguay, Local Fishery Councils (LFCs) were institutionalized a decade ago to involve fishers in managing and governing SSFs. This study assesses the LFC for the yellow clam SSF using three approaches: analysis of LFC meeting minutes, compilation of stakeholder perceptions, and analysis of social networks. The study found a decline in session frequency due to limited resources caused by the termination of an externally funded project. Performance indicators from the minutes identified recurring concerns on assessment, governance, and management, and issues related to monitoring, control, and surveillance. The influence of markets and the impact of red tides on fisheries performance were also brought up. Stakeholders perceived successful management solutions achieved through collaborative efforts, supporting co-management and resource recovery progress. However, social network analysis revealed communication patterns marked by core-periphery structure, showing partial disconnection and reluctance of the coastal marine authority to engage in inter-institutional collaboration. Despite challenges from climate change and markets, the LFC played a crucial role in co-creating solutions, empowering fishers with new skills and knowledge. Findings stress the importance of collaborative governance in promoting sustainable management and supporting institutional learning for transformative change in SSFs.

AB  - The rapid changes in information and communication technology (ICT), the increasing availability of processing power, and the complexity of mathematical software demand a radical re-thinking of science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics (STEAM), as well as mathematics education. In the transition to technology-based classrooms, the constant use of educational software is a requirement for sustainable STEAM and mathematics education. This software supports a collaborative and actionable learning environment, develops 21st-century skills, and promotes the adoption of active and innovative methodologies. This paper focuses on learning and teaching mathematics and analyzes the role and utility of ICT tools in education as computer algebra systems (CAS) and dynamic geometry systems (DGS) in implementing active and innovative teaching methodologies related to sustainable STEAM education. Likewise, it highlights the necessity for learners to have extensive knowledge of mathematical theory, an essential asset to ensure the reliable and effective use of mathematical software. Through a practical experiment, this study aims to highlight that a mixed teaching method can significantly improve the sustainability of math knowledge. It provides various solid examples of CAS and DGS applications to emphasize its usage rooted in a mathematical background to enable learners to identify when the computer solution is unreliable. The study highlights that the proper use of CAS and DGS is an efficient method of deepening our understanding of mathematical notions and solving tasks in STEAM subjects and real-life applications. This paper's goal is to direct our attention to the proper and intelligent use of computer tools, especially symbolic calculators, such as CAS and DGS, without providing an in-depth analysis of the challenges of these technologies. The outcomes of the paper should offer educators and learners new elements of active strategies and innovative learning models that can be immediately applied in education.

AB  - Sustainable innovations are of growing interest to both managers and researchers. Managers want to understand how to develop these innovations. However, researchers have extensively focused on this question by analysing the determinants of sustainable innovation development. The purpose of the study is to address this issue by adopting a process view, which is an underexplored perspective in the literature of sustainable innovation. More precisely, the paper seeks to highlight the temporal and relational dimensions in a sustainable innovation development process by focusing on the following questions: How does sustainable innovation develop through interactions and transformations made by a manager and stakeholders? What are the mechanisms used by the manager to facilitate these interactions and transformations? The actor-network theory offers theoretical (socio-technical analysis) and methodological (socio-technical graph) tools to examine such questions. They are used to understand and track the relative successful development of a hybrid bike by a small and medium-sized enterprise in Canada. The findings reveal managerial mechanisms (playing the role of sustainability translator, defining multivocal obligatory passage points, casting of allies, mobilizing actors-certifiers and-influencers) related to four translation moments (problematization, interessement, enrolment and mobilization) in the sustainable innovation development that led us to consider it as a synchronous process (co-construction and parallel association). The main contributions of the study are: 1) the use of socio-technical analysis to provide an in-depth level of understanding of a sustainable innovation development within an organization; 2) the complete application of the socio-technical graph method to track a manager and stakeholders' interactions and transformations; 3) the identification of managerial practices that contribute to the success of the sustainable innovation development. The paper suggests further research on the dynamic process of different types of sustainable innovation within various organizational contexts. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - BackgroundCurrent local food environments encourage poor diets, posing a significant threat to public and planetary health. Acknowledging and addressing its inherent complexity is vital to making meaningful improvements to the food environment. Using a participatory approach with local stakeholders, this study aims to gain insight into the factors and mechanisms underlying the local food environment and to identify leverage points and system-based actions to foster healthy and sustainable local food environments.MethodsA systems-thinking approach was used in a Dutch municipality in 2022. Two group model building (GMB) workshops were held with community stakeholders (e.g. local policymakers, retailers and residents). During the first workshop (June 2022), factors and mechanisms influencing the local food environment were identified and visualized through a causal loop diagram (CLD). During the second workshop, leverage points and system-based actions to improve food environments were identified by the stakeholders. Four months after (October 2022), an action-implementation meeting was organized to stimulate the implementation of selected actions. Progress was monitored through brief telephone interviews 6 and 12 months after the second workshop.ResultsThe CLD visualises the factors and mechanisms influencing the local food environment from the point of view of the community stakeholders. The CLD consists of 46 factors shaping the local food environment, which were categorized into four identified subsystems: societal factors, individual, socio-economic factors, commercial factors and political factors. Eight leverage points were identified within the CLD, for example, 'lobby from food industry', 'governmental food policies' and 'e-commerce and platform economy'. Stakeholders formulated 20 actions targeting the identified leverage points. During the action-implementation meeting, long-term plans were created for five actions. After 1 year, only one participant (policy advisory role) remained actively engaged in three of these actions.ConclusionsThis study yields insight into the numerous factors and mechanisms underlying the local food environment and identified system-based actions as perceived by local stakeholders to improve this food environment locally. The CLD offers stakeholders valuable insights on employing a systems approach when enhancing food environments. More research is necessary, especially into the long-term processes and effects of implementing system-oriented actions to improve local food environments.

AB  - The marine renewable energy industry is expanding as countries strive to reach climate targets as set out in the Paris Agreement. For tidal energy devices, the potential risk for animals to collide with a device, particularly its moving parts such as rotor blades, is often a major barrier in the consenting process. Theoretical work surrounding collision risk has commonly made use of a formulaic modelling approach. However, whilst providing a platform to assess conventional horizontal axis tidal turbines, the frameworks applied lack the flexibility to incorporate novel device designs or more complex animal movement parameters (e.g. dive trajectories). To demonstrate the novel simulation-based approach to estimating collision probabilities a hypothetical case study was used to demonstrated how the approach can assess the influence that variations in ecological and behavioural data had on collision probabilities. To do this, a tidal kite moving in a 3D figure-of-eight trajectory and a seal-shaped object were modelled and variations to angle of approach, speed and size of the animal were made. To further improve the collision risk estimates, results of the simulations were post-processed by integrating a hypothetical dive profile. The simulations showed how variation in the input parameters and additional post processing influence collision probabilities. Our results demonstrate the potential for using this simulation based approach for assessing collision risk, highlighting the flexibility it offers by way of incorporating empirical data or expert elicitation to better inform the modelling process. This framework, where device type, configuration and animal-related parameters can be varied with relative simplicity, on a case-by-case basis, provides a more tailored tool for assessing a diverse range of interactions between marine renewable energy developments and receptors. In providing a robust and transparent quantitative approach to addressing collision risk this flexible approach can better inform the decision-making process and aid progress with respect to developing a renewable energy industry in a sustainable manner. Therefore, the approach outlined has clear applications that are relevant to many stakeholders and can contribute to our ability to ensure we achieve sustainable growth in the marine renewable energy industry as part of a global strategy to combat climate change.

AB  - Challenges involving economic, environmental, and societal aspects necessitate organisations in business networks to collaborate. The scientific problem central to this paper is the difficulty of building sustainable collaborations. The research question is how to support organisations in building sustainable collaborations in their business relationships. This paper presents a new socio-technical approach to this end, i.e., PDPS (an acronym for Participatory Design of Participatory Systems) and explores its potential in a case study. PDPS is a value-based approach to the participatory design of participatory systems. Such socio-technical systems enable people working in different disciplines, departments, and organisational levels to create sustainable relationships supported by distributed information and communication technology. In a participatory system, participants gain trust, engagement, and empowerment to self-organise actions that produce results they could not have achieved alone. Following PDPS, participants collectively explore challenges in their relationship, define a joint value-based mission, and create a continuous process of self-organisation to fulfil this mission. In a case study, PDPS supported two Dutch business partners in solving recurring transport and logistics issues in retail store refurbishment projects. Turning their traditional business processes into participatory ones led to new solutions for sustainable transport and logistics, more joint business, and more profit. PDPS differs from other approaches in its involvement of all participants in a business relationship, its focus on shared values, and its capacity for creating a continuous process of self-organisation to fulfil a joint mission. This paper may support researchers, practitioners, and organisational policymakers interested in building sustainable collaborations in business networks.

AB  - The natural resources in the semi-arid area of Tigray, northern Ethiopia, have been exploited for years. This has caused severe land degradation, which in turn led to recurrent drought and poverty. To recover the degraded lands, soil and water conservation (SWC) interventions were given a policy attention since the 1970s. Starting 1990s, SWC-based integrated catchment management (ICM) implementation programmes, complemented by conservation-based agricultural development strategy, have been implemented. Many studies on ICM interventions and associated benefits have been reported so far. However, as most of the studies were conducted on experimental plots/small catchment scale, none of them have attempted to report the achievements and lessons at large scale. Hence, a comprehensive review is needed to explore and publicize the interventions and associated benefits. This review was conducted through detailed analysis of evidence and facts from literature, field observations and farmers' perceptions. The reviewed literature explicitly showed that ICM interventions have been successful in Tigray. Collective evidence has shown that most of the degraded landscapes are considerably restored, of which the soil fertility, availability of water, and rainfed and irrigated crop productivity have significantly increased over the last two decades. Consequently, environmental, ecological and socio-economic changes have been observed when compared to pre-implementation of ICM. Despite these achievements, some interventions often suffer from over-ambition, upward accountability and a top-down approach. Failures of Horeye and roof water harvesting, mismanagement of fertilisers, low survival of tree seedlings and lack of income from exclosures can be considered pitfalls that may affect the sustainability of the achievements. An important lesson drawn from Tigray is the participation of all stakeholders and the strong commitment and sense of ownership by the people and local government, which many projects lack worldwide. Observed experiences, achievements and implementation pitfalls can provide a lesson to other regions with similar agro-ecological, environmental and socio-economic setups.,

AB  - Background Simulation based learning (SBL) is a technique where teachers recreate "real life" clinical experiences for health care teams for purposes of gaining clinical skills in a safe environment. There is evidence that SBL is superior to the traditional clinical teaching methods for acquisition of clinical skills. Although it is well established in resource rich settings, there is limited experience in resource limited settings and there is uncertainty regarding how SBL will be perceived among the stakeholders in medical education. As part of the steps leading to implementation of a SBL program at a university in Uganda, we sought to describe the perceptions of various stakeholders regarding the introduction of SBL methodology into learning at a medical school in Uganda. Methods We conducted a formative qualitative assessment using key informant interviews (KIIs) among faculty members and university administrators and focus group discussions (FGDs) among medical and nursing students at Mbarara University of Science and Technology. Data were collected till saturation point and were transcribed and analyzed manually using open and axial coding approaches to develop themes. Results We conducted seven KIIs and three FGDs. Overall, findings were categorized into five broad themes: 1. Motivation to adopt simulation-based learning 2. Prior experience and understanding of simulation-based education 3. Outcomes arising from introduction of medical simulation 4. Drawbacks to establishment of medical simulation; and 5. Potential remedies to the drawbacks. Overall, our data show there was significant buy-in from the institution for SBL, stakeholders were optimistic about the prospects of having a new method of teaching, which they perceived as modern to complement the traditional methods. There was significant knowledge but very limited prior experience of medical simulation. Also, there was some concern regarding how students and faculty would embrace training on lifeless objects, the human resources needed and sustainability of simulation-based learning in the absence of external funding. Conclusion Stakeholders perceive SBL positively and are likely to embrace the learning methods. Concerns about human resource needs and sustainability need to be addressed to ensure acceptability.

AB  - Through the provision of a range of essential services, infrastructure systems profoundly influence development. At a time of increasing global investment in infrastructure, there is a need to support practitioners in making informed choices in order to achieve progress toward sustainable development objectives. Using the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (the SDGs) as a framework to structure infrastructure decision-making and trade-offs, this analysis develops a performance indicator system that assesses the potential development implications of a portfolio of infrastructure investments and policies. We develop metrics to assess the performance of infrastructure-linked targets. We then embed these metrics in a systems model that allows for the quantification of future infrastructure needs and the assessment of portfolios of infrastructure investments and policies that contribute to meeting these needs. These methods are applied to the small-island country of Curacao, demonstrating the potential for meeting the SDGs through adoption of strategies of cross-sectoral infrastructure investments and policies in the energy, water, wastewater and solid waste sectors. In the face of growing demands for infrastructure services, we find that inaction with regard to infrastructure supply and demand will lead to a 28% decrease in average SDG achievement across these targets by 2030. We assemble a portfolio of interventions that provide infrastructure services across these four sectors that enable achievement of 19 SDG targets directly linked to infrastructure. These interventions imply scaling up of infrastructure where there are gaps in service provision, ranging from an overall 10% increase in the water sector to a 368% increase in waste sector infrastructure from current capacities by 2030. Achieving the SDGs does not necessarily imply more infrastructure: in the energy sector the sustainable policy implies demand reductions of 32% from current levels. Nearly 50% of the assessed targets require intervention in more than one sector, emphasising the interdependent nature of the infrastructure system. The analysis addresses future uncertainties around the key drivers of residential population and tourism growth on the island by modelling infrastructure needs for alternate scenario projections. Averaged across the four sectors, these needs range from -14% (low) to +5% (high) in relation to the moderate projection. The analysis provides the first step towards a practical means of utilising infrastructure to deliver the SDGs, using quantitative indicators to underpin effective decision-making.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore post-Bolian reflexive theatre-based learning (TBL) theory and practice, in conjunction with meta-language and learning from experiences to address the gaps and silos between top-level macro strategy planning and operational micro-management on-going challenges in a contemporary new public management (NPM) major organizational change context.
   Design/methodology/approach - An investigation was carried out over three months at a major French utility in a praxis-related action research context (PRAR). TBL formats, i.e. "improvisational wrestling" and "improvisational cabaret", were adapted and put into practice.
   Findings - A reflective process in which participants developed an enhanced sense of ownership and interest in the targeted organizational structure was developed. It allowed for collectively created contextual in-house knowledge, innovative practices and tools that supported the change initiative.
   Research limitations/implications - The main limitation of this research is that it is case-based, restricting the generalizability of its findings. Future research could examine the general validity of improvisational TBL forms and the way they can contribute to the creation of participatory innovation oriented corporate cultures. Also, an interesting research question would be to investigate how organizations, once having undertaken NPM initiatives, can continue nurturing a collaborative practice-based organizational culture over the long-haul, showing a clear need for longitudinal studies.
   Practical implications - The present initiative and case study was deemed as successful by all stakeholders, and the programme of engaged change management sustainable and self-reinforcing.
   Originality/value - This study extends the knowledge of the role of arts in enhancing organizational reflection. To the best of the knowledge, the TBL formats employed have never been used previously in PRAR. The paper builds links between organizational management, knowledge creation and micro-level organizational innovation. It fills a research gap concerning the content and the practices enabling innovation processes. Last but not the least, this study builds an actionable and replicable ( yet not generalizable) framework based on reflexive theatre techniques as a novel learning approach in knowledge production in public sector enterprises undergoing a major organizational change.

AB  - Background: Research capacity building and its impact on policy and international research partnership is increasingly seen as important. High income and low-and middle-income countries frequently engage in research collaborations. These can have a positive impact on research capacity building, provided such partnerships are long-term collaborations with a unified aim, but they can also have challenges. What are these challenges, which often result in a short term/non viable collaboration? Does such collaboration results in capacity building? What are the requirements to make any collaboration sustainable? This study aimed to answer these and other research questions through examining an international collaboration in one multi-country research capacity building project ARCADE RSDH (Asian Regional Capacity Development for Research on Social Determinants of Health).
   Method: A qualitative study was conducted that focused on the reasons for the collaboration, collaboration patterns involved, processes of exchanging information, barriers faced and perceived growth in research capacity. In-depth interviews were conducted with the principal investigators (n = 12), research assistants (n = 2) and a scientific coordinator (n = 1) of the collaborating institutes. Data were analysed using thematic framework analysis.
   Results: The initial contact between institutes was through previous collaborations. The collaboration was affected by the organisational structure of the partner institutes, political influences and the collaboration design. Communication was usually conducted online, which was affected by differences in time and language and inefficient infrastructure. Limited funding resulted in restricted engagement by some partners.
   Conclusion: This study explored work in a large, North-South collaboration project focusing on building research capacity in partner institutes. The project helped strengthen research capacity, though differences in organization types, existing research capacity, culture, time, and language acted as obstacles to the success of the project. Managing these differences requires preplanned strategies to develop functional communication channels among the partners, maintaining transparency, and sharing the rewards and benefits at all stages of collaboration.

AB  - Education plays a key role in ensuring that all learners are equipped with the knowledge and skills needed to promote sustainable development. The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) set out the key challenges of our time with targets to protect the planet, end poverty, and improve the prospects of all people by 2030. As global challenges including access to healthcare and climate change escalate, the need for action is even more pressing. Education is an enabler of change and presents opportunities to support learners to explore how they can participate in transformative education experiences that focus on building a more sustainable world. Science education provides unique opportunities to explore sustainability given the nature of the discipline, the knowledge it reflects, and its focus on inquiry based pedagogical approaches. This study explores the nature of science as an academic discipline, as it is lived and perceived within the teaching of an undergraduate Science Education (biological sciences) program in a Higher Education Institution (HEI) and its capacity for the integration of Education for Sustainable Development (ESD). An ethnographic informed research design was adopted to document the social culture, perspectives, and practices inherent in the educational setting. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with academics and tutors from the HEI's Science Department who contribute to the program (n = 11). Focus groups were held with pre-service teachers enrolled on the program (n = 21) and observations from lectures, laboratory sessions, and field trips were carried out. Findings arising from analysis of data point to a strong link between science and society in science education, and the need for learners to develop critical scientific literacy that enables them to meaningfully navigate the multiple perspectives presented in media and public debates relating to sustainability issues. Findings suggest that while sustainability themes permeated some modules in the program, the emphasis was on imparting hard, technical knowledge rather than allowing for the critical exploration of issues. Results also highlight some discipline specific challenges to adopting discursive pedagogical approaches in the science education program. Some ways of understanding these findings are explored.

AB  - This paper discusses observations of an architecture and environmental engineering undergraduate design studio project assigned to 4th year students at a UK university. In the UK, most architecture courses are characterised by a high proportion of design studio teaching supported by varying amount of technical modules that include environmental and construction learning. Recent scholarship on sustainability education in architecture, discusses the necessity for new approaches that enhance transdisciplinarity, autonomy and independent decision-making. However, despite increasing importance to both practice and policy, few empirical or theoretical examples account for the implications or experiences of such an approach. This study presents the experiences of an architecture and environmental engineering design studio whereby studio activities are closely interlinked with technical engineering enquiry and experiment. Specifically, the research examines the challenges and opportunities students face when assigned a design project that attempts to translate independently derived briefs into novel architectural environmentally engineered interpretations. The analysis draws on a series of ethnographic narrative and visual observations carried over a period of 6 months. The implications of the findings are threefold. First, the analysis shows the opportunities an integrated cross-disciplinary approach can offer, where the gap between creative and technical domains is narrowed. Second, the study presents some of the challenges faced by increased autonomy and lack of prescription that students encounter. Third, the paper contributes to an emerging agenda of sustainability education in the built environment by offering valuable insights into the benefits and difficulties cross-disciplinary approaches pose to architectural education.

AB  - Existing literature has highlighted how Environmental Social Governance (ESG) reporting enables companies to drive their Circular Economy (CE) practices. However, current approaches to ESG reporting do not specifically consider how company activities and decisions about CE contribute to sustainable development. Indeed, CE has a great potential to ensure that companies actively participate in the achievement of the United Nations 2030 Agenda Goals although a more effective way to link CE and sustainability reporting processes is necessary. The present paper recognizes the importance of developing a standardized approach that aligns ESG metrics with CE practices to enhance both transparency and accountability. To this end, taking into consideration the relevance of the GRI guidelines to make the ESG performance of companies more transparent, an expert-based analysis of the importance of GRI topics to capture the ability of CE practices to create circular value is proposed. Creating circular value through CE improves the company's profitability and resilience while reducing costs for customers, and benefits society and the environment. The use of the fuzzy AHP (F-AHP) method ensures that the relevance of the economic, environmental, and social performance is estimated to make ESG reporting more informative about the company's commitment to a restorative and regenerative business. The findings offer guidelines for using CE reporting information to compare the companies' contributions to SDGs.

AB  - This study investigates various factors for assessing sustainability in Multi-tier Supply Chains (MtSCs) using a hybrid approach consisting of an empirical study and fuzzy expert system. After an extensive literature review, four research questions were formulated and a questionnaire designed. From its distribution, 152 responses were collected from the textile industry. Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) was employed to determine the most effective factors that could contribute to the evaluation of extensive aspects of sustainability in MtSCs as well as recognize the importance of constructs. The categorized constructs based on their importance included "Environmental issues", "Economic issues", "Policy and governance", "Participation", "Social issues", "Transparency" and "Leadership and support". A comprehensive rating for evaluating sustainability by indicating a readiness score and linguistic variables for each construct was developed in the form of a "fuzzy expert system". The developed fuzzy expert system was applied in an Iranian textile company to assess its readiness status as a case application. The results indicated that the company had the highest and lowest readiness in "Transparency" and "Environmental issues" with total readiness scores of 2.65 and 0.17 respectively. The finding recommends that the company should pay more attention to environmental issues such as making a cutback on utility consumption and increasing recycled materials. The framework's validity was measured around 90% based on the satisfaction of experts' judgments, which enables the framework to be applied in different industrial settings. Theoretically, the findings contribute to the Resources-Based View (RBV) theory, with a focus on the sustainability of MtSCs, by unveiling a comprehensive set of factors for assessing sustainability and recognizing external and internal strategic resources that lead firms to sustainable competitive advantages.

AB  - China's sustainable development goals and carbon neutrality targets cannot be achieved without revolutionary transitions of the agricultural sector. The rapid development of digital technologies is believed to play a huge role in this revolution. The ongoing prevention and control of COVID-19 has greatly boosted the penetration of digital technology services in all areas of society, and sustainable transformation driven by digital technologies and services is rapidly becoming an area of innovation and research. Studies have shown that the rapid advancement of digitalization is also accompanied by a series of new governance challenges and problems: (1) unclear strategic orientation and inadequate policy and regulatory responses; (2) various stakeholders have not formed a sustainable community of interest; (3) information explosion is accompanied by information fragmentation and digital divide between countries and populations within countries. Meanwhile, current research has focused more on the role of digital services in urban governance and industrial development and lacks systematic research on its role in sustainable agricultural and rural development. To address the realities faced by different stakeholders in the process of digital transformation of agriculture, this paper aims to propose an inclusive analytical framework based on the meta-governance theory to identify and analyze the demand, supply, actor networks, and incentives in the digital technology-and-services-driven sustainable agricultural transformation, starting from the goals and connotations of sustainable agricultural and rural transformation and the interactions among different stakeholders in governing information flows. This analytical framework is further applied to analyze the cases of China and the EU. Although China and the EU represent different development phases and policy contexts, the framework is valid for capturing the characteristics of information flows and actor networks along the flows. It is concluded that a common information platform based on the stakeholder network would benefit all stakeholders, help reach common framing of issues, and maintain a dynamic exchange of information. Depending on the country context, different types of stakeholders may play different roles in creating, supervising, and maintaining such platforms. Digital infrastructures/products as hardware and farmers digital capacity as 'software' are the two wings for digital sustainable transformation. Innovative incentives from different countries may inspire each other. In any case, farmers' actual farming behavior changes should be an important criterion for evaluating the effects and effectiveness of digital transition governance.

AB  - The strategic goals of the United Nations and the Aichi Targets for biodiversity conservation have not been met. In-stead, biodiversity has continued to rapidly decrease, especially in developing countries. Setting a new global biodiver-sity framework requires clarifying future priorities and strategies to bridge challenges and provide representative solutions. Hyper-arid, arid, and semi-arid lands (herein, arid lands) form about one third of the Earth's terrestrial surface. Arid lands contain unique biological and cultural diversity, and biodiversity loss in arid lands can have a dis-proportionate impact on these ecosystems due to low redundancy and a high risk of trophic cascades. They contain unique biological and cultural diversity and host many endemic species, including wild relatives of key crop plants. Yet exten-sive agriculture, unsustainable use, and global climate change are causing an irrecoverable damage to arid lands, with far-reaching consequences to the species, ground-water resources, ecosystem productivity, and ultimately the commu-nities' dependant on these systems. However, adequate research and effective policies to protect arid land biodiversity and sustainability are lacking because a large proportion of arid areas are in developing countries, and the unique di-versity in these systems is frequently overlooked. Developing new priorities for global arid lands and mechanisms to prevent unsustainable development must become part of public discourse and form the basis for conservation efforts. The current situation demands the combined efforts of researchers, practitioners, policymakers, and local communities to adopt a socio-ecological approach for achieving sustainable development (SDGs) in arid lands. Applying these ini-tiatives globally is imperative to conserve arid lands biodiversity and the critical ecological services they provide for future generations. This perspective provides a framework for conserving biodiversity in arid lands for all stakeholders that will have a tangible impact on sustainable development, nature, and human well-being.

AB  - PurposeAlthough literature abounds on lean sustainability (LS), its contributions to manufacturing industries' triple bottom line performance (TBLP) through top management commitment (TMC) remain scanty. This research explores the mediating role of TMC in the nexus between LS and TBLP.Design/methodology/approachGiven the study's quantitative focus, the causal design was utilised. The structured questionnaire, a survey instrument, was used to gather primary data from 285 manufacturing organisations in Ghana, a developing country. Data analysis was done with structural equation modelling.FindingsIt was found that LS and TMC positively influence TBLP, whereas TMC partially mediates the connection between LS and TBLP of Ghanaian manufacturing organisations.Research limitations/implicationsThe study concentrates on Ghana's manufacturing industry and embraces the stakeholder theory and quantitative methods.Practical implicationsThis research underlines why top managers must prioritise investment in LS to promote sustainable development and attain their organisations' TBLP targets. The study also provides key insights for top managers to consistently commit enormous resources towards developing lean practices, contributing favourably to TBLP. By establishing the interplay among LS, TMC and TBLP, manufacturing practitioners and researchers can further advance new strategies to address the growing sustainability concerns and achieve higher economic, social and environmental performance.Originality/valueThe study's originality lies in analysing the mediation effect of TMC on the linkage between LS and TBLP in a developing economy where manufacturing organisations are continuously exposed to resource and waste management problems and lack adequate commitments from top managers towards sustainability initiatives. It is also the first to establish relationships between top management commitment and TBLP in the manufacturing industries of developing economies, concentrating on Ghana.

KW  - REFORM
AB  - Community participation in health service decision making is entrenched in health policy, with a strong directive to develop sustainable, effective, locally responsive services. However, it is recognised that community participation is challenging to achieve. The aim of the present study was to explore how a rural health service in Victoria enacts community participation at the local level. Using case study methodology, the findings indicate that enactment of community participation is desired by the health service, but a lack of understanding of the concept and how to enact associated policy are barriers that are exacerbated by a lack of resources and community capacity. The findings reveal a disconnect between community participation policy and practice.
   What is known about the topic? The need to involve communities in health service planning, implementation and evaluation is a feature of health policy across major Western countries. However, researchers have identified a dearth of research on how community participation is enacted at the local service level.
   What does this paper add? The study that is presented herein addresses a gap in knowledge of community participation policy enactment within a rural health service. Insights are provided into the challenges faced by rural health services, with a disconnect between policy ideal and the reality of implementation.
   What are the implications for practitioners? Health service staff need clear direction from chief executive officers about the purpose of community participation policy and the expectations for individual roles. Community advisory committees need clarity about the community member role and the processes for making decisions. Services and their boards would benefit from targeted government funding to resource community participation activity.

AB  - Transitions to more sustainable food systems are urgently needed, but they are also very complex and hard to achieve. The integration of transdisciplinary approaches into transition research can help to understand and promote sustainable food system transitions, but remains an agenda item in this research field. To fill this gap, this article describes how the multi-level perspective (MLP) can be used as a framework for explorative, participatory scenario development. On the one hand, MLP provides scholars with a framework for understanding the dynamics of transitions. On the other hand, participatory scenario development brings together academic and non-academic actors and perspectives to explore and promote possible development pathways. Based on this framework, researchers and practitioners jointly co-created four scenarios of how the landscape of five relevant European food innovations located in established food systems or niches (alternative sources of proteins, prosumer initiatives, regional value chains, school meal programs, and dietary interventions) might change by 2040 and further explored how these food innovations might evolve under the scenarios. The results provide initial insights into the role that food innovations could play in different transition pathways and also indicate the value of a diverse portfolio of food innovations to respond to changing circumstances. Furthermore, the process allowed participants to develop a shared understanding of food system dynamics and explore potential future risks and opportunities for food innovations, showing that participatory scenarios based on the MLP framework are a useful lens for exploring sustainable food system transitions.

AB  - In 2014, the Galapagos National Park Directorate, sponsored by various international non-governmental organizations, initiated a comprehensive marine and terrestrial spatial planning process to improve the management effectiveness of Galapagos' protected areas. This effort aimed to reconfigure management areas by expanding or redistributing no-take zones to protect Key Biodiversity Areas and ensure the conservation of at least 30% of terrestrial and marine ecosystems in the Galapagos. However, this process encountered significant challenges, notably the erosion of fishers' trust following the implementation of a "Marine Sanctuary". This top-down decision resulted in socio-political tension, compelling the Ecuadorian government to delay the implementation of the new marine zoning until there was conclusive scientific data on its socio-economic impact on local smallscale fishers' livelihoods. This paper examines the achievements and shortcomings of the Galapagos zoning update process, highlighting the successful integration of scientific zoning criteria and the enhanced protection of critical biodiversity areas, together with the reduced support from fishers and legal disputes. To move forward, we recommended a bottom-up approach centered on rebuilding trust among the fishing community via innovative engagement strategies and the introduction of market incentives to promote sustainable practices. Assessing the long-term impact of no-take zones is essential for refining management approaches. Additionally, the application of cutting-edge technology within an adaptive co-management model is recommended to improve fisheries and ecological data gathering and analysis, facilitating proactive and well-informed management decisions. Our suggestions aim to reconcile conservation objectives with the needs and aspirations of the local communities in this iconic archipelago.

AB  - Mountain social -ecological systems (SES) supply important ecosystem services that are threatened by climate change. In mountain SES there is a paradox between high community capacity to cope with extremes, and governance structures and processes that constrain that capacity from being realised. Climate adaptation that maintains livelihoods and supply of ecosystem services can catalyse this innate adaptive capacity if new adaptive governance arrangements can be created. Using the French Alps as a case study, we outline a participative framework for transformative adaptation that links adaptive capacity and governance to provide social innovation and ecosystem-based adaptation solutions for mountain SES. Grassland management was the main entry point for adaptation: bundles of adaptation services supplied by the landscape mosaic of biodiverse grassland types can maintain agricultural production and tourism and facilitate income diversification. Deliberate management for core adaptation services like resilient fodder production, erosion control, shade or aesthetic value generates co-benefits for future transformation ability. People activate bundles of adaptation services along adaptation pathways and realise benefits via co-production with other forms of capital including traditional knowledge or social networks. Common and distinctive adaptation services in each pathway create options for transformation if barriers from interactions between values and rules across scales can be overcome. For example conserving mown terraces which is a critical adaptation nexus reflects a complex interplay of values, markets and governance instruments from local to European scales. We conclude that increasing stakeholders capacity to mobilise adaptation services is critical for empowering them to implement adaptation to global change.

AB  - As the globe strives to solve severe environmental challenges, the concept of a low-carbon economy that prioritizes low energy use, little pollution, and sustainable development is gaining support. The supply chain management industry is not safe from the possibilities and threats posed by this new development. In light of the emerging norm, it is imperative that all supply chain links be economically and ecologically sustainable. For conventional businesses, ensuring environmental advantages and practicing the issue of equitably dividing supply network node profits is exacerbated by green supply chain management. This paper was prompted by the increasing need for information on green supply chain management (GSCM). GSCM is based on the idea of incorporating ecological considerations into traditional SCM practices. Therefore, GSCM is vital in shaping the cumulative environmental effect of businesses engaged in supply chain operations. To assess environmental sustainability requirements, we provide a best-worst method (BWM), a subset of China-based sectors in order to fill this void. The BWM was used to evaluate and quantify the impact of a variety of industrial operations and criteria on environmental quality. To make sure this approach is effective and reliable, we polled 34 experts for their input on which indications from our preliminary literature analysis would be most useful. This study's findings, supported by a sensitivity analysis, indicated stated "waste management" was the single most important indication for China-area businesses to achieve environmental sustainability. The results of this study provide industry managers, decision-makers, and practitioners with the information they need to choose areas of focus during the implementation phase that will have the most impact on promoting social sustainability in their organizational supply chain and moving toward sustainable growth.

TI  - A scenario-specific nexus modelling toolkit to identify trade-offs in the promotion of sustainable irrigated agriculture in Ecuador, a Belt and Road country

AB  - Increased demand for food due to development and population growth has prompted irrigated agriculture expansion, posing enhanced global challenges to water, energy, and food security. To confront these challenges, an approach that considers the water-energy-food-environment nexus can address multidimensional trade-offs that complicate the efficient use of resources and the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals. In order to provide insights into solutions to these challenges for a specific case, this study develops a modelling toolkit that integrates biophysical and socioeconomic aspects of nexus components in the context of agro-export and irrigation expansion in Ecuador, a Belt and Road Country. The nexus toolkit is applied to agriculturaldevelopment scenarios defined in participatory workshops and incorporates a water resources model, a lifecycle environmental assessment, and a socioeconomic analysis. The modelling exercise is constructed around specific scenario-determined land use patterns in the Santa Elena peninsula of Ecuador. Agriculture in the peninsula is water-limited, relying on delivery infrastructure and transfers from a neighbouring catchment. Impacts on nexus components are analysed for ten crops under two potential land-use scenarios: a substantial increase in irrigated area due to investment in irrigation infrastructure; and a substantial shift in land use towards export crops. The two have distinct impact on water and energy use, global warming potential, freshwater eutrophication, terrestrial acidification, and fine particulate matter formation. The results provide insights into future water and energy resource challenges and environmental and socioeconomic trade-offs associated with likely changes in irrigation expansion. The results for scenarios show that, for example, banana production has the greatest environmental impacts (e.g. a 519% increase in global warming potential and 452% increase in fine particulate matter form for scenario 2), primarily due to water and energy requirements, despite the crop being mainly produced organically. In addition, total net income and labour demand increase (net income increases by 43% and 217% under scenarios 1 and 2, respectively) due to a larger crop area and crop intensification. Scale effects on labour demand are mainly due to labour intensity of maize in Ecuador, which is disadvantaged in the crop export scenario (an unexpected result). However, expanding irrigated areas would also increase total water and energy demand for irrigation, global warming potential, and freshwater eutrophication. This type of information enables stakeholders and decision-makers to design policies that achieve equitable and sustainable agricultural production, water use, and economic growth.

AB  - There is increasing emphasis on psychological and social approaches to managing and treating mental illness, including a growing evidence base on the effectiveness of community-based social interventions including arts and heritage activities, library programmes, volunteering schemes, nature-based activities and community groups. However, there is a gap in understanding of what the barriers to, and enablers of, working with individuals with mental illness might be for the community and voluntary sector. A qualitative approach was used involving focus groups with non-profit organisations delivering social activities within communities across the United Kingdom. Behaviour Change Theory, the COM-B model and the Theoretical Domains Framework, were employed as the theoretical framework, to develop interventions to address the barriers raised. Representatives of the organisations reported being motivated by the mental health needs of others, and by seeing the benefits of participation. Further motivations included expanding inclusion, and economic motivation to ensure sustainability. Strengths identified included offering innovative, responsive services that were distinct from conventional mental health services. Running these services demanded new and potentially challenging skills, such as understanding statutory responsibilities, and being able to train and support staff. Further challenges included maintaining boundaries between their roles as community organisations and clients' mental health needs and avoiding burn-out. Ability to deliver this work was enhanced by support of peer organisations and opportunities to share practice. However, funding was often short term, and complex to obtain, which could destabilise organisations' sustainability. Lack of transparency around the process, differences in language between the community and health sectors, and confusion around commissioning pathways undermined the potential opportunity offered by social prescribing policy. Interventions to address these barriers were identified, including long term funding to support core costs, training on engaging with the commissioning process, around mental health support and safeguarding, and developing mentoring schemes and local co-operatives of organisations for developing partnerships with the health sector.

AB  - Increasing awareness for sustainability has led to the proliferation of initiatives in the wine industry. These initiatives mainly aim at managing the environmental aspects of wine production. In this context, the identification of suitable indicators is crucial to evaluate the industry's progress toward sustainability. Firstly, in the present study, the main environmental impacts of wine production are reviewed, with specific reference to LCA studies. On this baseline, the main programs from the New World, Europe and Italy that address sustainability in the wine sector are examined. Results show that each program has its strengths and weaknesses, but there is still a large margin to merge the best of these programs in one unique protocol internationally recognized. Therefore, the authors have compared the set of indicators employed by two specific wine industries initiatives (the Italian VIVA and Californian CSWA) and the indicators implemented by the wine Italian companies certified with the Environmental Management System (EMS), defined by the European Regulation EMAS. A specific evaluation framework has been developed to assess the comprehensiveness of these indicators in terms of their capacity to address the triple bottom line of sustainability. Findings reveal that while VIVA consider environmental, economic and social aspects, CSWA and EMAS focus mainly on environmental impacts of wine production. Additionally, only EMAS has an approach to the evaluation of raw materials efficiency and waste management. The outcome of the study integrates existing literature on sustainable wine production, expanding the scope of previous analysis and introducing an evaluation framework that stakeholders of the industry may apply to introduce new indicators sets to assess sustainability performances of wine producers.

AB  - ObjectivesTo evaluate the End-of-Life and Bereavement Care model (SWAN) from conception to current use.DesignA realist evaluation was conducted to understand what works for whom and in what circumstances. The programme theory, derived from a scoping review, comprised: person and family centred care, institutional approaches and infrastructure. Data were collected across three stages (May 2021 to December 2021): semi-structured, online interviews and analysis of routinely collected local and national data.SettingStage 1: Greater Manchester area of England where the SWAN model was developed and implemented. Stage 2: Midlands. Stage 3: National data.ParticipantsTwenty-three participants were interviewed: Trust SWAN leads, end-of-life care nurses, board members, bereavement services, faith leadership, quality improvement, medicine, nursing, patient transport, mortuary, police and coroners.ResultsResults from all three stages were integrated within themes, linked to the mechanisms, context and outcomes for the SWAN model. The mechanisms are: SWAN is a values-based model, promoting person/family-centred care and emphasising personhood after death. Key features are: memory-making, normalisation of death and 'one chance' to get things right. SWAN is an enablement and empowerment model for all involved. The branding is recognisable and raises the profile of end-of-life and bereavement care. The contextual factors for successful implementation and sustainability include leadership, organisational support, teamwork and integrated working, education and engagement and investment in resources and facilities. The outcomes are perceived to be: a consistent approach to end-of-life and bereavement care; a person/family-centred approach to care; empowered and creative staff; an organisational culture that prioritises end-of-life and bereavement care.ConclusionThe SWAN model is agile and has transferred to different settings and circumstances. This realist evaluation revealed the mechanisms of the SWAN model, the contextual factors supporting implementation and perceived outcomes for patients, families, staff and the organisation.

AB  - Food supply chains face challenges of sustainable supply chain management, such as waste management and environmental issues. Vertical integration or system integration is a corporate strategy for chicken production managed by the focal company. This research study discusses the role of the focal company for achieving sustainable development goals (SDGs) in a Brazilian food poultry supply chain. The research consisted of a single case study with the following steps: literature review, identification of the gaps, concepts synthesis, and case study. The findings indicated theoretical and empirical guidelines for SDGs. The literature review indicated the relevance of exploring some approaches to achieve sustainable supply chain management: corporate social responsibility, green supply chain management, industrial ecology, stakeholder theory, circular economy (reduce, reuse, and recycle with economic prosperity), and sustainability science. The focal company plays a strategic role in the vertical integration operation of the Brazilian poultry supply chain. The case study findings indicate the role of the focal company toward the actors, including the feed mill supplier, live poultry transport, poultry processor, rendering plant, and distributor. However, much remains to be accomplished to answer the question "how to be sustainable?", especially in environmental and social issues involving all actors in the poultry supply chain. The Brazilian environmental legislation still needs to be revised to be aligned with SDGs because the legislation will not guarantee sustainable management and efficient use of natural resources. The critical issues and challenges are radical changes in business models, measurement of supply chain impacts, collaboration and network picturing, corporate social responsibility versus supply chain responsibility, stakeholder engagement, frameworks to implement SDGs, education about SDGs and public participation, and food supply chain integrated system forums.

AB  - In recent decades, the issue of environmental sustainability has become increasingly important worldwide and there is growing pressure from stakeholders for companies to transform themselves in order to mitigate their environmental impacts. Green Human Resource Management (GHRM) plays an important role in promoting a corporate culture of environmental responsibility, ensuring the effectiveness of companies' environmental strategy through its direct role with employees. In response to the lack of studies on GHRM and its implementation in the Portuguese business context, this study aims to map the GHRM practices implemented by companies operating in Portugal and to identify the perceived benefits, constraints, and challenges in implementing these practices. A total of 15 semi-structured interviews with human resource managers and environment-related management professionals of companies selected from an Environmental Management Systems-ISO 14001 database were conducted. The results show that organizations in Portugal implement environmental practices that fall within the scope of GHRM. The practices identified also range across transversal categories such as digital, mobility, products and waste management, infrastructure, performance, production, and corporate events. However, a holistic approach is needed and GHRM should be built under a multidimensional and well-planned system. This study argues that perceived benefits are constrained by the specific characteristics of the Portuguese business context which results in obstacles for the implementation and success of GHRM practices. The implications of the results for the organizations are discussed and suggestions are put forward.

AB  - Understanding the motivations and benefits of citizen science (CS) participants is critical to the success of environmental science projects that rely on data collection from engaged citizens. Tailored communication with citizen scientists is essential, leading to the need to target specific societal groups for extensive and high-quality data sets. The purpose of the study was to apply marketing concepts such as stakeholder analysis, value proposition canvas (VPC), and key performance indicators (KPIs) to CS projects. The study examined the extent to which these strategies can be applied to CS projects and add value, resulting in improved recruitment and retention of participants, as well as improved project management. The dynamic landscape of CS projects requires adapted business-oriented approaches supporting ongoing participation with high motivation, acknowledging community needs, and recognizing institutional scientists, akin to targeting potential customers. The case study focuses on the CityCLIM initiative, an EU-funded project collecting urban climate data, especially air temperature, using mobile weather stations. The CityCLIM VPC, analyzing stakeholder groups, facilitated tailored communication strategies by analyzing stakeholder groups and highlighting the effectiveness of the CS cycling initiative within the "Stadtradeln" program. Impact KPIs served as a roadmap for strategic refinement, while data quality KPIs identified deficiencies, guiding adjustments to the campaign. Applied marketing tools improved project planning, engagement, and evaluation, demonstrating the potential of this concept. Adapting marketing tools to recruitment and communication strategies benefits CS projects by targeting specific groups. The holistic integration of stakeholder analysis, VPC, and KPIs streamlines project management and creates a framework for sustainable success. This adaptation forms a robust toolkit for CS project coordinators, contributing to effective communication, engagement, and impact assessment. Applying marketing tools significantly increases CS projects' reach and impact, ensuring long-term success and meaningful scientific contributions.

AB  - Nowadays, industries across the globe are acknowledging the need for a Net Zero Supply Chain (NZSC) by 2050, particularly within the Manufacturing Supply Chain (MSC) due to its significant contribution to Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. Government and regulatory bodies pressure the industry to reduce GHG emissions. Industries focus on cleaner and sustainable production by adopting net zero technique practices. Achieving the net zero goal needs technological integration, such as Caron Capture Technology (CCT) and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). Are LCA and CCT unlocking the potential for net-zero practices in MSC? This still needs to be answered. Therefore, this study aims to identify and prioritize potential enablers of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to facilitate the NZSC. We identified potential enablers using a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) and expert opinion. An empirical study validated these enablers, followed by the application of the "Best-Worst Method (BWM)" to rank them and the "Fuzzy Decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (F-DEMATEL)" to identify causal relationships. The outcomes of this study reveal that 'Energy Management and Emission Reduction' is the most critical category of enablers, followed by 'Governance and Collaboration', 'Assessment and Digitalization', and 'Sustainable Materials and Production'. Outcomes highlight the importance of integrating technological innovations and stakeholder engagement to achieve net-zero goals. The implications of this study provide valuable insights for policymakers and practitioners. By focusing on the prioritized enablers, the manufacturing industry can effectively implement LCA, develop the NZSC business model, and enhance competitiveness in the global market. This study contributes to the ongoing discourse on sustainable manufacturing practices and offers a strategic framework for achieving NZSC by 2050.

AB  - As the area of the world's forests shrinks, the management of production forests is becoming increasingly paramount for biodiversity conservation. In the United States and Australia, public debate and controversy about the management of production forests during the later decades of the 20th century resulted in governments adopting sweeping top-down changes to forest policy, with regional forest plans a cornerstone of this process. This paper reviews the biodiversity conservation outcomes of two such processes, the Southeast Queensland Forests Agreement (Australia) and the Northwest Forest Plan (United States). Several key lessons are identified. First, these plans are significant steps forward in the struggle to conserve forest biodiversity while providing for production of timber. Second, expanding the conservation reserve system by itself does not necessarily ensure biodiversity conservation, especially if reserves are traded off for increased timber harvesting in forests outside of reserves or if certain important elements of biodiversity are not accounted for either by conservation forests or production forests. Third, reserves often need active management to restore diversity in previously-logged forests and reduce fuels that have accumulated as a result of fire exclusion. Fourth, the current plans fall short of the comprehensive whole-of-landscape, multiple-ownership approach needed to support long-term sustainable forestry and biodiversity conservation. Fifth, adaptive management was not adequately institutionalized and sometimes misapplied, although, in the case of the Pacific Northwest, a major regional monitoring strategy was developed and partially implemented. Finally, ecological science suffered in the collision with the socio-political decision-making process due to the limited scope that was left for testing and evaluating the new approaches to forest management. We conclude, based on the evaluation of the two regional plans, that regional biodiversity conservation goals may be better achieved by implementing sustainable forest management practices across all ownerships and involving all stakeholders and the broader community.

AB  - The awareness and the engagement of various stakeholders play a crucial role in the successful implementation of climate policy and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). SDG 13, which refers to climate action, has three targets for combating climate change and its impact. Among the three targets, SDG 13.3 aims to "improve education, awareness-raising and human and institutional capacity on climate change mitigation, adaptation, impact reduction, and early warning". This target should be implemented based on the understanding of climate change awareness among various groups of societies. Furthermore, the indicator related to awareness-raising is absent in SDG 13.3. Hence, this study aims to explore the differences in climate change awareness among various social groups within a country from a text mining technique. By collecting and analyzing a large volume of text data from various sources, climate change awareness was investigated from a multilateral perspective. Two text analyses were utilized for this purpose: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling and term co-occurrence network analysis. In order to integrate and comparatively analyze the awareness differences among diverse groups, extracted topics were compared by classifying them into four indicators derived from the detailed targets in SDG 13.3: mitigation, adaptation, impact reduction, and early warning. The results show that the Korean public exhibited a relatively high awareness of early warning compared to the other four groups, and the media dealt with climate change issues with the widest perspective. The Korean government and academia notably had a high awareness of both climate change mitigation and adaptation. In addition, corporations based in Korea were observed to have substantially focused awareness on climate change mitigation for greenhouse gas reduction. This research successfully explored the disproportion and lack of climate change awareness formed in different societies of public, social, government, industry, and academic groups. Consequently, these results could be utilized as a decision criterion for society-tailored policy formulation and promoting climate action. Our results suggest that this methodology could be utilized as a new SDG indicator and to measure the differences in awareness.

AB  - The proliferation of screen-free programmable robotics allows teachers to implement age-appropriate integrated activities that can promote child learning and development. However, very scarce is known about the challenges of using programmable robots as a tool to empower children in minority communities. This mixed-methods case study examined a Free Quality Kindergarten situated in a low-income public housing estate in Hong Kong to explore the affordances and challenges of robot programming (RP) in early childhood education (ECE). Both quantitative and qualitative data were generated through videotaped observations, child assessments and teacher interviews to journey with the teaching team as they managed to implement the newly introduced RP curriculum. Child assessment evidence revealed that there was a statistically significant improvement in CT scores over 6 weeks of RP activities, while the pretest-posttest change of child self-regulation scores was nonsignificant. Video analysis results further revealed that children's interaction level with the robot kit significantly predicted the change of self-regulation over time. Qualitative results are presented to explicate the micro, meso and macro conditions that constrain the implementation of RP curriculum, including the following: (a) teachers' limited TPACK in RP education, (b) a disconnect between the RP curriculum and the school-based curriculum, (c) limited resources and (d) the Confucian tradition and cultural barriers. These illustrate the intricacies involved in the implementation of RP education to empower marginalized children in under-resourced ECE settings. This study will help bring systemic change to the ECE field by uncovering ecological difficulties in integrating new technologies to promote inclusiveness and sustainability for the future. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Screen-free robot programming (RP) is beneficial for preschool children in terms of promoting their computational thinking (CT) and executive functioning. RP can be generally engaging for preschool children from a middle-class background. What this paper adds The study is addressing the inclusiveness and sustainability according to the learning needs of kindergarten students, especially those from less privileged backgrounds. The story-based approach to RP can cater to the learning needs and interests of children from a lower socio-economic background, which is likely to enhance their CT skills. Children with a higher level of interaction with the robot kit benefited more from the RP activities in terms of self-regulation skills. This study used multiple methods (ie, video analysis, teacher interview and child assessment) to reveal the effects of micro, meso and macro contexts on RP education in an under-resourced Hong Kong kindergarten. Implications for practice and/or policy RP education should be cautiously prompted in diverse early childhood settings, especially the less privileged institutions, to enhance positive effects. Critical constraints on the use of programmable robots to empower marginalized children should be adequately addressed when trying to integrate RP into early childhood education. Teachers should receive training and continual support in RP-related pedagogical strategies to facilitate and scaffold children's learning.

AB  - COVID-19 pandemic has been threatening the sustainability of companies in Indonesia. Various policies and restrictions have caused a significant decline in sales and led to bankruptcy. As the major players in the national economy, the micro, small, medium enterprises (MSMEs) are encouraged to focus on their survival and sustainability. Survey method is done to examine the direct effect of human capital readiness and information capital readiness on business sustainability. It investigates whether the relationship is sequentially mediated by market orientation and business performance. Online questionnaires were distributed to 347 owners/managers of Indonesian manufacturing MSMEs in the East Java Province, Indonesia. PLS-SEM equation modeling was employed to test the hypotheses. Result shows that human capital readiness and information capital readiness positively affect business sustainability, and business performance does not mediate the effect of human capital readiness on business sustainability. Most important finding reveals that market orientation and business performance sequentially mediate the human capital readiness-business sustainability relationship. Market orientation and business performance sequentially mediate information capital readiness-business sustainability relationship. This study contributes to the development of resource-based view (RBV) by providing the empirical result on the important internal resources on sustainability. This brings practical awareness to the owners/managers of Indonesian MSMEs on increasing their market orientation to enhance their business performance and to guarantee their business sustainability. Practically, this research has important implications for achieving business sustainability as it offers a way for practitioners to improve business sustainability by utilizing human capital readiness, information capital readiness, market orientation, and business performance.
   In Indonesia, the COVID-19 pandemic has been tough on business, especially smaller ones. This study focused on investigating micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) by surveying 347 manufacturing businesses in East Java to check how ready these businesses were in terms of their workforce (human capital readiness) and how well they used information and knowledge (information capital readiness). The findings were clear: businesses with strong human and information capital readiness were more likely to be sustainable. However, the road to success wasn't direct. The study found that two things really mattered: market orientation (how well a business understands and meets customer needs) and business performance. For businesses with well-prepared people, market orientation played a crucial role in sustainability. On the flip side, businesses with good information use needed both market orientation and strong business performance to ensure long-term success. For small businesses in Indonesia, having skilled people and using information effectively is vital. But it's not enough on its own. Understanding the market and performing well as a business are equally important, especially in challenging times like the COVID-19 pandemic. This information is valuable for business owners and managers, guiding them to improve strategies and secure the long-term success of their companies.

AB  - There is increasing recognition of the importance of local knowledge in conservation governance and sustainable use of natural resources. This article studies three social-ecological systems: Bigi Pan, Noord Coronie, and Noord Saramacca - each designated as a Multiple Use Management Area (MUMA) by the Surinamese government. The main focus of this article is how local knowledge and user perspectives may contribute to the management of a MUMA, including to making decisions about biodiversity and natural resources. We use an action research approach that includes qualitative case study methodology, participant observations, group and individual interviews. The analytical framework is based on the SES model from Ostrom (2009) to understand interactions between subsystems as mediated by local and other forms of knowledge. We also explore how participatory engagement with MUMA resource users includes local knowledge and user perspectives. The findings show how local knowledge can offer tools and solutions to improve conservation governance by supporting the development of realistic management plans and by supporting better understanding of the interactions between social and ecological subsystems. Moreover, action research helps to recognize local knowledge as valuable for science and promotes social learning among stakeholders. This paper concludes that local knowledge has contributed to policy decisions that are connected to the use practices of the people who are of the place and know the context well. The inclusion of local knowledge through participatory drafting of management plans has contributed to overcoming some major management challenges and helped to build a supportive social environment for conservation.
   Local support for MUMAs will only be successful if community engagement is truly institutionalized.Participatory drafting of management plans is helpful in recognizing local knowledge and promoting social learning among stakeholders.Embedding local knowledge in management plans is fundamental to securing sustainable outcomes in MUMAs.Local knowledge includes knowledge about the resource system, individual resource units, and the governance system.Local resource users and local government agencies held various opinions about community engagement.Local knowledge is the result of the interactions between subsystems of SES.

AB  - Understanding and learning geographic knowledge and applying it to sustainable development (SD) depends not only on the knowledge itself, but also on how it is taught and studied. The teaching and learning methods for promoting sustainability in geography have not been thoroughly studied. This qualitative study examined articles on geography teaching and SD. The material was selected using keywords related to geography education. The study describes 17 articles published in peer-reviewed scientific journals from 2008 to 2018. The focus group varied from primary to higher education. The proportion of teaching and learning methods were determined. The data were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. The foci of the analyses were the teaching and learning methods, topics, goals, and levels of thinking skills. Additionally, features of the teaching methods used in geography education, including outdoor education, to achieve the sustainable development goals (SDGs) were investigated. Different teaching methods used together and interactive learning were the most often preferred. Group work and teachers' presentations were mentioned in 12 articles, and inquiry-based learning and argumentation in half of the articles. The most often written expressions promoting SD in geography education concerned environmental sustainability (42%), followed by social (25%), economic (19%), and cultural sustainability (14%). The most emphasized features of the current teaching methods were active participation, thinking skills, animation, evaluation, dialog, demonstrations, and information and communication technology skills. The whole school approach and forward-looking perspective in geography should be implemented in school education to reach the SDGs and to support SD.

AB  - PurposeThough there is literature on green collaboration to supplier selections, there are hardly any empirical studies that analyze collaborative networks toward green supplier selection (GSS) from the perspective of green relational capital (GRC). Therefore, this study aims to fill this research gap by analyzing the development of collaboration toward GSS through the lenses of GRC. Also, this study explores how collaboration between institutions and their relevant green stakeholders, framed through the lens of GRC influences the selection of green suppliers.Design/methodology/approachThis study uses an exploratory case study approach involving public universities in Ghana. This study is based on interviews conducted with 27 key respondents across seven universities. A purposive sampling technique was used in selecting respondents who were interviewed face-to-face with a semi-structured interview guide. Atlas ti software was used to generate themes for discussion.FindingsThis study's findings suggest that the reason green criteria are not integrated into supplier selection is due to an insufficient collaboration among relevant green stakeholders. Through green training workshops, conferences, continuous professional development and affiliation with professional bodies, procurement practitioners can develop a collaborative network among themselves to promote the integration of green sustainability into supplier selection. Constructs that help to establish strong collaborative network identified in this study include trust and consistency, mutual benefits, obvious intentions and effective communication.Practical implicationsThis study identified constructs promoting effective green collaboration toward the adoption of GSS. These constructs as identified in this study, provide a clear means of developing green collaboration among relevant stakeholders. By fostering and developing collaboration, the main construct of GRC, institutions can successfully integrate green sustainability into their supplier selection process, leading to long-term benefits for both the environment and the institution.Social implicationsCollaboration toward integration of green sustainability into supplier selection necessitates engagement with various relevant green stakeholders, including suppliers, customers, government bodies, colleagues in sister institutions and environmental advocacy groups. This fosters a sense of shared responsibility and collective action toward sustainability goals.Originality/valueThis study offers empirical evidence on the impact of collaboration on supplier selection and green sustainability performance, contributing to the existing body of literature. By analyzing collaboration, a perspective of GRC, toward the integration of green sustainability into supplier selection is considered as a novel study.

AB  - This paper examines whether or not specific forms of adaptation governance that involve city administrations and citizens can help (or hinder) creating a foundation for more sustainable climate adaptation and transformation. Based on the analysis of recurring patterns of social adaptation dilemmas (caused by the inter-dependencies between adaptation providers and beneficiaries), associated actor constellations, policy approaches, and gaps, this paper presents principles for supporting city citizen commoning for climate adaptation (Le. joint actions needed to create systems to manage 'shared' adaptation resources). The presented principles can assist in facilitating the management of public goods for adaptation, including privately-provided adaptation goods, and relate to four strategic aims: i) the effective management of collective and individual resources; ii) comprehensive risk reduction; iii) sustained local institutional linkages (mainstreaming); and iv) matching different actors' views, efforts and capacities. The principles synthesise and extend the literature by considering, and providing space for, a comprehensive understanding of risk and its root causes, and for alternative rationalities or Cnonrationall behaviours intended to address them. The latter takes account of the subjectivities (e.g. emotional attachments to resources and seascapes), which are as important as power structures with respect to how climate adaptation is managed. In fact, subjectivities are central to the operation of city administrations as they are an integral part of how people understand their relationship to others. In an adaptation context, this means focusing on practices and interactions that are required for taking adaptation actions, and how they can both promote and frustrate attempts to collaborate. We conclude that the developed principles can support more sustainable climate adaptation and transformation by holistically addressing existing adaptation dilemmas, actor constellations, and the associated policy gaps that make current approaches ineffective.

AB  - Within the existing literature body, the evaluation exercises predominantly adopt expert disciplined assessments to explore the biophysical conditions and economic values of ecosystem services (ES) and ecosystem disservices (EDS). This preference largely emerges from the relative convenience in data collection and quantification of these approaches, collectively accrue to practitioners' beliefs that unless explicitly quantified and monetized, these benefits will be negligible. Social aspects of ecosystems contributions to human well-being, on the other hand, are comparatively harder to grasp, thus predominantly overlooked in the general assessment of ES and EDS. To alleviate this imbalance, we presented a case study in exploring relevant ES and EDS within the context of a protected area using non-monetary methods with the aid of the local community. In particular, through deliberative mapping approach, the manuscript strived to locate, quantify, and assess a full range of relevant ES and EDS as perceived by local inhabitants across the landscape of U Minh Thuong National Park (UMTNP), Vietnam. Within the scope of this paper, we also delved into how socio-cultural perceptions and preferences towards these natural resources diverge among groups of respondents. Through the presented research, we strived to consolidate the baseline understanding regarding the ES profile of the research area with relevant social insights, paving the way for the design and implementation of sustainable management strategies. Finally, this manuscript also sought to present a practical measure to account for social dimensions and their relevance to the general assessment of ES.

AB  - The Indian electronics industry is facing immense pressure to include sustainability practices in order to meet customer expectations, comply with legislation and create an edge over competitors. This growing need for inclusion of sustainability is driving original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to collaborate with third-party reverse logistics providers (3PRLPs) to sustainably manage returns. Collaboration with 3PRLP will put OEMs in a stronger position regarding compliance with government legislation, improving upon their corporate image and customer satisfaction. It is a win-win situation for the OEM. On the other hand, from the 3PRLP's point of view, it is important to know the capabilities of the OEMs before entering into a collaborative endeavour. Hence, it is firstly necessary to identify the most appropriate attributes of the manufacturer which are essential for a sustainable collaboration. In this context, the study proposes a novel framework for investigating the performance attributes of the OEMs from the economic, environmental and social aspects of sustainability. Since the evaluation of each attribute for each dimension of sustainability differs in terms of the nature of the information needed and the time and resources required, it is necessary to conduct a pre-evaluation of the attributes using the Complex Proportional Assessment (COPRAS) method. Furthermore, the shortlisted attributes for each sustain ability dimension are evaluated and prioritized using the best worst method (BWM). The novelty of the attribute selection process lies in simultaneously considering the degree of importance of the attribute as well as the degree of difficulty of the collection of data required for the assessment of the OEM. The result of this study helps decision-makers and practitioners to comprehend the most influential attributes of OEMs which are crucial for collaboration, thus enhancing the overall sustainability impact of the supply chain. The managerial implications drawn from the resulting analysis provide the 3PRLP with a sustainable evaluation framework which can be ideally used for the selection of collaborative partners. The above model is validated using the case of an Indian 3PRLP company that handles electronic products.

AB  - BackgroundInterprofessional student-led clinics offer authentic clinical experiences of collaborative patient care. However, theoretical research on the sustainability of these clinics, considering forms of capital beyond the economic, remains limited. This study addresses this gap by employing Bourdieu's theoretical framework to explore how alternative conceptions of capital; both social and cultural might sustain conditions for interprofessional working in a student-led clinic serving patients living with a chronic neurological impairment.MethodsThe teaching and learning focussed clinic was established in 2018 to mirror a clinical service. Semi-structured focus groups with participants involving 20 students from 5 professions and 11 patients gathered in-depth insights into their experiences within the clinic. A thematic analysis was guided by Bourdieu's concepts of field, habitus, and capital.ResultsIn the complex landscape of the student-led clinic, at the intersection of a patient support group, a hospital-based aged care facility, and university-based healthcare professions, three pivotal mechanisms emerged underpinning its sustainability: Fostering students' disposition to interprofessional care, Capitalizing on collaboration and patient empowerment, and a Culture of mutual exchange of capital. These themes illustrate how students and patients specific dispositions towards interprofessional healthcare enriched their habitus by focusing on shared patient well-being goals. Diverse forms of capital exchanged by students and patients fostered trust, respect, and mutual empowerment, enhancing the clinic experience.ConclusionThis study bridges an important gap in theoretically informed explorations of the conditions for sustaining student-led clinics, drawing on Bourdieu's theory. It accentuates the significance of investment of diverse forms of capital in such clinics beyond the economic, whilst emphasizing a primary commitment to advancing interprofessional healthcare expertise. Recognizing patients as equal partners shapes clinic dynamics. In order for student clinics to thrive in a sustainable fashion, educators must shift their focus beyond solely maximizing financial resources. Instead, they should champion investments in a wider range of capital forms. This requires active participation from all stakeholders; faculties, patient partners, service providers, and students. These findings underscore the importance of investing in interprofessional learning by optimizing various forms of capital, and embracing patients as dynamic contributors to the clinic's sustainability.

AB  - Multiple international and supranational organizations call upon changes in current waste management practices to play a key role in developing more sustainable economies. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a popular method used to assess the sustainability of future waste management options. The uncertainties about future energy systems and waste compositions, however, may lead to ambiguous LCA results. One way to deal with this challenge is the development of joint energy and waste scenarios to investigate the robustness of waste management options. To date, joint energy and waste scenarios rely on the integration of large economic and engineering models. Complex models can hamper the transparency required for decision-makers to understand and implement LCA recommendations. Here we present the alternative of combining diverse energy scenarios and stakeholder-based waste storylines. This is a more qualitative approach than previous sustainable energy/waste evaluations and has a double aim: to address upfront the energy and waste composition sensitivity and enhance transparency by both relying on well-documented energy scenarios and involving stakeholders in the waste storyline formulation. We apply the approach to the Swiss municipal solid waste (MSW) management system in the context of the energy transition away from nuclear power. Three energy scenarios capture how radical the transition might be, while the storylines reflect societal developments and waste policies leading to low, high, and average MSW amounts. The approach delivers feasibility spaces of energy systems and waste compositions as input to the LCAs. It ensures a high level of transparency, which, in conjunction with the participation of decision-makers, has the potential to increase the chances of implementation of the recommendations based on LCA results.

AB  - The Balanced Scorecard (BSC) is a performance management tool that analyzes the relationship between tangible and intangible assets. Its ability to render business strategy visible has earned it the distinction of being a strategic management model. Sustainability has become an important part of daily and business life today. With the increasing importance given by stakeholders to environmental and social issues, companies find it necessary to evaluate sustainability activities in their performance evaluations. In order to meet this need, the Sustainability Balanced Scorecard (SBSC) emerged with the addition of a sustainability perspective or parameters to BSC. The number of academic studies pertaining to the application of BSC, which numerous companies and subjects to research have utilized, is inadequate. Due to its hierarchical structure and the necessity to evaluate numerous criteria, BSC is suitable for using multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods. In this paper, an integrated approach consisting of SBSC, the Picture Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (PF-AHP), and the Objective Matrix (OMAX) method is proposed for the performance measurement of companies. The PF-AHP method has been reorganized for ease of application in determining the perspectives, strategic objectives, and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) weights within SBSC. Additionally, the OMAX method has been employed for calculating the performance scores. This proposed approach was implemented in a factory operating in the glass industry. The SBSC created for the company includes five perspectives, 16 strategic objectives, and 34 KPIs. PFAHP method was used to determine the weights of perspectives, strategic objectives, and KPIs to be used in the performance score calculation with OMAX. The weight of financial perspective is 0.267, the weight of the customer perspective is 0.247, the weight of the internal process perspective is 0.191, the weight of the learning and development perspective is 0.161, and the weight of the sustainability perspective is 0.134. The evaluations made by the decision-makers indicate that the company's performance measurement still adheres to the traditional framework. The performance score of the company is 6.14 out of 10.

AB  - Sustainability research has witnessed significant growth over the past three decades, owing to the multiplicity of concerns and innovations to address them. Fake news, on the other hand, is a growing challenge to this dynamic narrative about sustainability and associated innovations. Notwithstanding few attempts to glean insights from literature at the nexus of sustainability, concomitant innovations, and fake news, the current study undertakes an integrative literature review with the objective of comprehending the repertoire of interactions between fake news, concomitant acts of deception, and sustainability-focused innovations. The review yielded 81 research articles published between 1992 and 2022. This collection represents a highly heterogeneous body of work encompassing these dimensions wherein comprehensive frameworks are rare and empirical works have focused on a limited range of innovations and fake news. The paper organizes the extant literature across four key themes and identifies five crucial gaps that have remained underexplored to date. Based on gaps in the literature, a research agenda with a set of thematic pathways and a holistic conceptual framework is presented to serve as a foundation for advancing research in the domain. This study is one of the first attempts to shed light on the menace of fake news in the context of sustainability-focused innovations and provides the necessary impetus for researchers to investigate empirical relationships and causal mechanisms surrounding the triadic nature of interlinkages between sustainability concerns, associated innovations, and fake news. The insights from this study aid practitioners in evaluating innovations from a novel vantage point and devising strategies to navigate potential pitfalls, while also serving as crucial evidence for policymakers to leverage an optimal mix of policy levers to circumvent sustainability concerns and foster innovations amidst the looming crisis of fake news.

AB  - Mountain social-ecological systems (MtSES) are vital to humanity, providing ecosystem services to over half the planet's human population. Despite their importance, there has been no global assessment of threats to MtSES, even as they face unprecedented challenges to their sustainability. With survey data from 57 MtSES sites worldwide, we test a conceptual model of the types and scales of stressors and ecosystem services in MtSES and explore their distinct configurations according to their primary economic orientation and land use. We find that MtSES worldwide are experiencing both gradual and abrupt climatic, economic, and governance changes, with policies made by outsiders as the most ubiquitous challenge. Mountains that support primarily subsistence-oriented livelihoods, especially agropastoral systems, deliver abundant services but are also most at risk. Moreover, transitions from subsistence- to market-oriented economies are often accompanied by increased physical connectedness, reduced diversity of cross-scale ecosystem services, lowered importance of local knowledge, and shifting vulnerabilities to threats. Addressing the complex challenges facing MtSES and catalyzing transformations to MtSES sustainability will require cross-scale partnerships among researchers, stakeholders, and decision makers to jointly identify desired futures and adaptation pathways, assess trade-offs in prioritizing ecosystem services, and share best practices for sustainability. These transdisciplinary approaches will allow local stakeholders, researchers, and practitioners to jointly address MtSES knowledge gaps while simultaneously focusing on critical issues of poverty and food security.
   Plain Language Summary Mountain ecosystems and the human communities that inhabit them deliver critical resources-such as fresh water and timber-to over half the planet's human population. Despite their importance, there has been no global assessment of threats to mountain systems, even as they face unprecedented challenges to their sustainability. With survey data from 57 mountain sites worldwide, we test our understanding of the types of stresses that are threatening mountain systems as well as the resources and benefits that come from mountains. We find that mountain systems worldwide are experiencing both gradual and abrupt climatic, economic, and governance changes. One of the most ubiquitous challenges facing mountain systems is that policies directly affecting mountain systems are being made by those living outside of the mountains themselves. Mountains that support primarily subsistence-oriented livelihoods in the developing world, especially mixed agriculture and animal husbandry systems, deliver abundant services but are also most at risk. Addressing the complex challenges facing mountain systems will require partnerships among researchers, stakeholders, and decision makers to jointly identify the types of futures they desire and the actions to achieve these. This approach will address knowledge gaps in mountains while simultaneously focusing on critical issues of poverty and food security.

AB  - The effectiveness of the application of value stream mapping (VSM) highly relies on the analysis of current state mapping (CSM) that focuses on identification, evaluation and solution processes of the non-value added (NVA) activities. The conventional application of VSM is performed for these processes using the "effect-based solution" approach. Here, the effects of NVA activities (known as production waste), such as defects, lead time, bottlenecks, etc. are separately identified and evaluated before being related to Lean tools for solution. These tools then recommend ways to eliminate/minimize waste. This conventional approach, however, will lead to unstable solution for long term practice due to its mechanism in targeting the effect as a primary solution rather than the root cause of the effect. In the literature, there are very limited works highlighting these processes in systematic, practical and effective ways. Therefore, this paper introduces a methodology called the VSM-Lean Thinking (VSM-LT) model to improve the analysis of CSM. Then, guides a feasible solution identification before it can be visualized in future state mapping (FSM). The key idea behind this VSM-LT model is to identify and evaluate the root cause of the waste as revealed by CSM. The waste is then treated by solving the identified root cause(s) as a primary solution target. The model provides a chain-effect relationship mapping platform to identify and evaluate the root cause (s). It can be carried out based on four steps; NVA effect identification, LT-based operation features deficiency matching, possible root cause(s) mapping and solution identification & mechanism description. The model is then validated using a case study in a small medium enterprise (SME) of the food-based manufacturing industry. Validation results showed that multiple NVA activities visualized through CSM, come from one similar root cause. Therefore, feasible solution strategies and mechanisms are then recommended. Based on identified root causes, the FSM is then presented to visualize the improvement. Related measures of expected improvement are then compared. In overall, the proposed model is significantly beneficial for VSM practitioners to improve the analysis and evaluation of CSM towards identifying more sustainable solutions for their industry-based operational problems.

AB  - In the context of global sustainability challenges and China's strategic prioritization of ecological civilization, understanding the evolution of and gaps in ecological civilization education research has become imperative. This study employs bibliometric and content analysis methods to examine 446 publications obtained from the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) and Web of Science databases (2000-2024) with the goal of mapping the knowledge structure and academic trajectory of ecological civilization education in China. Our analysis reveals three distinct phases of research evolution: the nascent stage (2000-2007), the developmental stage (2008-2012), and the rapid growth stage (2013-present). Each phase was driven by pivotal policy shifts, notably the national ecological civilization strategy that was introduced in 2012. While China has institutionalized ecological civilization education with the aim of establishing a balance among environmental, social, and economic development, research on this topic has focused predominantly on higher education and ideological-political frameworks; however, only limited interdisciplinary integration and societal engagement is evident in this context. High-frequency keywords such as "ecological civilization education" and "universities" emphasize a top-down, institution-centric approach. International studies have tended to emphasize sustainable development, but they have often overlooked China's unique ideological context. Notably, ecological civilization education remains fragmented and excessively policy-driven, and a coherent theoretical foundation for and robust integration of this approach into broader educational systems remain lacking. Addressing these gaps is vital with respect to efforts to identify the role played by ecological civilization education beyond campuses, thereby promoting interdisciplinary innovation and ensuring that it is in line with global sustainability education frameworks. By transforming ecological civilization education into a holistic, globally resonant model, China can both advance its national ecological goals and contribute to international sustainable development efforts.

AB  - An ecosystem-based management approach (EBM) is suggested as one solution to help to tackle environmental challenges facing worldwide farming systems whilst ensuring socio-economic demands are met. Despite its usefulness, the application of this approach at the farm-scale presents several implementation problems, including the difficulty of (a) incorporating the concept of ecosystem services (ES) into agricultural land use decision-making and (b) involving the farmer in the planning process. This study aims to propose a solution to overcome these challenges by utilising a geodesign framework and EBM approach to plan and design a sus-tainable multifunctional agricultural landscape at the farm scale. We demonstrate how the proposed approach can be applied to plan and design multifunctional agricultural landscapes that offer improved sustainability, using a New Zealand hill country farm as a case study. A geodesign framework is employed to generate future land use and management scenarios for the study area, visualize changes, and assess the impacts of future land use on landscape multifunctionality and the provision of associated ES and economic outcomes. In this frame-work, collaboration with the farmer was carried out to obtain farm information and co-design the farmed landscapes. The results from our study demonstrate that farmed landscapes where multiple land use/ land cover types co-exist can provide a wide range of ES and therefore, meet both economic and environmental demands. The assessment of impacts for different land use change scenarios demonstrates that land use change towards increasing landscape diversity and complexity is a key to achieving more sustainable multifunctional farmed landscapes. The integration of EBM and geodesign, is a transdisciplinary approach that can help farmers target land use and management decisions by considering the major ES that are, and could be, provided by the landscapes in which these farm systems are situated, therefore maximising the potential for beneficial outcomes.

KW  - curriculum
AB  - Schools of architecture play a major role in motivating and inspiring students to gain competencies in sustainability through pedagogical practices. However, at the operational level, the incorporation of sustainability within architectural programmes needs to be integrated into both the curricula and teaching methods. There are few studies on how architectural programmes' curricula and pedagogical practices can be institutionally articulated, as well as on how the required coherency among components can be empowered operationally. Since the interrelation of the courses form the structure of the curricula and provide certain inputs for the students' knowledge and skill, any operational risk can harm the quality assurance. Therefore, an operational framework aimed for a coordinated incorporation of sustainability in architectural programmes is required. In order to achieve this, scrutinising substantial equivalence programmes could provide constructive outcomes for the improvement of the existing programmes and future experiences for students. In order to determine the articulation of sustainability issues in architectural education, in this research, a recently accredited school in the Eastern Mediterranean region was chosen as a case study. The study includes an analysis of course descriptions, teaching methods, and teacher and student perceptions about the incorporation of sustainability into the courses. Also, jury sessions' evaluation criteria are assessed as a pedagogical tool. Then, the horizontal and vertical articulation of courses within the curricula and their coordination were studied accordingly. The findings reveal that horizontal and vertical relations between different course types that share similar learning objectives are very important. However, this relation and continuum should be perceivable by students, tutors, and the relevant stakeholders; otherwise, any attempt would remain superficial. Accordingly, the association of sustainability with pre-defined evaluation criteria for grading is very important. The methodological tools and lessons from this study can assist young architecture programmes with the incorporation of sustainability into their programme without changing its spirit, through the coordination of courses within curricula and adopted pedagogical tools.

AB  - Brazil has a network of marine extractive reserves (RESEX), a form of marine protected area (MPA) using comanagement. The RESEX program aims to bring traditionally marginalized populations with natural resource dependent livelihoods into national development processes by empowering them to participate in governance and steward biodiversity conservation. We apply the social-ecological systems framework (SESF) and collective action theory to diagnose challenges for comanagement in the Caete-Teperacu marine RESEX near Braganca, Brazil, a multiuse mangrove estuary supporting a small-scale crab fishery. We conducted key informant interviews and build on over 20 years of research in the region to provide an overarching analysis of the challenges facing comanagement. We describe the variables from the SESF in the case context and find that many social and ecological variables interact in clusters over time, and these clusters can be identified as themes, including (1) social and political momentum supporting the RESEX; (2) shifting perceptions of local residents and fishers; (3) patron-client relationships and social-ecological traps; (4) challenges with institutional fit; and (5) the interactions between harvesting closures, compensation, and dependence on local natural resources. Furthermore, we use collective action theory to help explain the role that each variable plays in either hindering or enabling successful governance. Our findings suggest that institutional resilience is needed to make RESEX adaptive to shifting social and political momenta. It could do this by providing more platforms for communication, deliberation, and knowledge exchange among the relevant actors. We believe our findings reflect broader challenges facing RESEX implementation throughout Brazil, and lessons can be learned for MPAs facing difficulties with the implementation of comanagement worldwide.

AB  - Purpose The paper aims to evaluate how progressive stakeholders view the adoption of contemporary techniques such as virtual technology in driving sustainable quality in an emerging economy context. Design/methodology/approach The authors adopted a systematic literature review to develop the theoretical framework for virtual reality (VR) technology adoption in sustaining quality in agriculture production. The framework was refined after discussion with a panel of academic experts. The refined theoretical framework was further empirically validated using Partial Least Square Structure Equation Modelling. Findings The study focuses on the future perspective of the perception for progressive farming with the adoption of VR technology in an emerging economy. The data were collected from the stakeholders (farmers, collectives, cooperative, etc.), for their future perspectives for the adoption of VR technology and sustainable quality agriculture production. The study may help build up VR technology in emerging economies which may take years to be established. Research limitations/implications The perception of the future perspective of VR technology study conducted has limitations. The findings are well established on technology adoption; however, the technology used will take many extra years to find its application in the agriculture sector. The study offers insightful theoretical, managerial and policy implications for sustainable quality in agriculture production through the adoption of virtual reality (VR) technology. The authors found very few works that focused on VR technology adoption. Originality/value The study discusses VR, which has an impact on sustaining the quality of agriculture production. The study has notable managerial and policy implications that suggest the future perspective for VR technology in agriculture production. The study is an unexplored area that needs research to capture future perspectives.

AB  - Precision agriculture provides important issues toward a more sustainable agriculture. Many farmers have the necessary technology to operate site-specifically, but they do not use it in practice, and thus available information and communications technology (ICT) systems are not used to their full potential. This paper addresses how to reduce the so-called "problem of implementation", based on the knowledge that participatory approaches during the design and development process is one of the most important factors to frame technology adoption. The development of sustainable ICT systems through theories and methodologies from the fields of human computer interaction and user-centered design (UCD) is presented and an ongoing Swedish project for development of an agricultural decision support system (AgriDSS) for nitrogen fertilization is used as an example to frame the issue. The overreaching aim is to develop AgriDSSs that are sustainable in design as well as through design by stressing the importance of participatory approaches for the successful development of AgriDSSs. The Swedish project has the intention to apply a UCD approach, and some pitfalls on starting to use this way of working is identified as well as some suggestions on how to reduce them through co-learning processes. Despite the challenges presented in this paper, ICT can contribute significantly to long-term sustainable development. Thus, several competences and scientific disciplines need to act in concert to help develop a sustainable development of agriculture via a transdisciplinary approach that can make an impact on society at many levels.

AB  - The development and survival or disappearance of civilizations has been based on the performance of soils to provide food, fibre, and further essential goods for humans. Amongst soil functions, the capacity to produce plant biomass (productivity function) remains essential. This function is closely associated with the main global issues of the 21st century like food security, demands of energy and water, carbon balance and climate change. A standardised methodology for assessing the productivity function of the global soil resource consistently over different spatial scales will be demanded by a growing international community of land users and stakeholders for achieving high soil productivity in the context of sustainable multifunctional use of soils. We analysed available methods for assessing the soil productivity function. The aim was to find potentials, deficiencies and gaps in knowledge of current approaches towards a global reference framework. Our main findings were (i) that the soil moisture and thermal regime, which are climate-influenced, are the main constraints to the soil productivity potential on a global scale, and (ii) that most taxonomic soil classification systems including the World Reference Basis for Soil Resources provide little information on soil functionality in particular the productivity function. We found (iii) a multitude of approaches developed at the national and local scale in the last century for assessing mainly specific aspects of potential soil and land productivity. Their soil data inputs differ, evaluation ratings are not transferable and thus not applicable in international and global studies. At an international level or global scale, methods like agro-ecological zoning or ecosystem and crop modelling provide assessments of land productivity but contain little soil information. Those methods are not intended for field scale application to detect main soil constraints and thereby to derive soil management and conservation recommendations in situ. We found also, that (iv) soil structure is a crucial criterion of agricultural soil quality and methods of visual soil assessment like the Peerlkamp scheme, the French method "Le profil cultural" and the New Zealand Visual Soil Assessment are powerful tools for recognising dynamic agricultural soil quality and controlling soil management processes at field scale. We concluded that these approaches have potential to be integrated into an internationally applicable assessment framework of the soil's productivity function, working from field scale to the global level. This framework needs to serve as a reference base for ranking soil productivity potentials on a global scale and as an operational tool for controlling further soil degradation and desertification. Methods like the multi-indicator-based Muencheberg Soil Quality Rating meet most criteria of such a framework. This method has potential to act as a global overall assessment method of the soil productivity function for cropping land and pastoral grassland but needs further evolution by testing and amending its indicator thresholds.

AB  - Increasing globalization and the emergence of disruptive learning technologies have derived a pedagogical paradigm shift from the conventional on-campus higher education to the digital and online higher education. Massive open online courses (MOOCs), especially, are the most notable manifestation of educational transformation. We developed a MOOC entitled Introduction to Land Management (ILMx MOOC) for potential entrants to the land management domain, or for those who simply want to become aware of land-related challenges and brought together with thousands of participants worldwide with freely accessible course content and rooms for open discussion. Our experience with ILMx MOOC has accumulated new knowledge and insight across a broad range of questioning on how to design and develop alternative courseware and teach using digital learning technologies in land management. This paper examines an account of emerging patterns of demographics, geography, and course engagement throughout the ILMx MOOC. We found that the subject of land management in digital higher education affects gender gaps in enrolments. We also assume that the topic of land management has been globally recognized as an important nexus to guide professionals in international development studies and practices as well as sustainability research. However, new behavioral patterns of learners were also observed. They participated in the learning process very enthusiastically only during the first month of the course and this seems to be due to lack of motivation and interest to induce learners efficiently into the learning content. We believe that the culture of excellence in land management needs to be accompanied by engaged excellence and new forms of educational culture and work processes. This means that the high-quality and rigorous knowledge we produce and accumulate is coupled closely with new styles of educational development and delivery, new types of resources and hardware, and extensive engagement with countries, localities, people, and practices of those who handle land matters.

AB  - Background: Preterm birth (PTB) is the leading cause of death in children under age five. Healthcare policy and other decision-making relevant to PTB may rely on obsolete, incomplete or inapplicable research evidence, leading to worsened outcomes. Appropriate knowledge transfer and exchange (KTE) strategies are an important component of efforts to reduce the global PTB burden. We sought to develop a 'landscape' analysis of KTE strategies currently used in PTB and related contexts, and to make recommendations for optimising programmatic implementation and for future research.
   Methods: In the University of California, San Francisco's Preterm Birth Initiative, we convened a multidisciplinary working group and examined KTE frameworks. After selecting a widely-used, adaptable, theoretically-strong framework we reviewed the literature to identify evidence-based KTE strategies. We analysed KTE approaches focusing on key PTB stakeholders (individuals, families and communities, healthcare providers and policymakers). Guided by the framework, we articulated KTE approaches that would likely improve PTB outcomes. We further applied the KTE framework in developing recommendations.
   Results: We selected the Linking Research to Action framework. Searches identified 19 systematic reviews, including two ;reviews of reviews'. Twelve reviews provided evidence for KTE strategies in the context of maternal, neonatal and child health, though not PTB specifically; seven reviews provided 'cross-cutting' evidence that could likely be generalised to PTB contexts. For individuals, families and communities, potentially effective KTE strategies include community-based approaches, 'decision aids', regular discussions with providers and other strategies. For providers, KTE outcomes may be improved through local opinion leaders, electronic reminders, multifaceted strategies and other approaches. Policy decisions relevant to PTB may best be informed through the use of evidence briefs, deliberative dialogues, the SUPPORT tools for evidence-informed policymaking and other strategies. Our recommendations for research addressed knowledge gaps in regard to partner engagement, applicability and context, implementation strategy research, monitoring and evaluation, and infrastructure for sustainable KTE efforts.
   Conclusions: Evidence-based KTE, using strategies appropriate to each stakeholder group, is essential to any effort to improve health at the population level. PTB stakeholders should be fully engaged in KTE and programme planning from its earliest stages, and ideally before planning begins.

AB  - The United Nations Water Conference 2023 highlighted the need for concrete actions to boost integrated water resources management for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and called for strategies to enhance cooperation among stakeholders. Technical cooperation between countries and institutions in transboundary systems, e.g., on environmental data collection, is an effective way to promote international diplomacy and prevent disputes between riparian states. Still, establishing collaborations to inform bilateral dialogues on the identification of environmental challenges, their causes, and development priorities may be a difficult task in itself. This is particularly true in the African context because of limited resources and lack of data. In this paper, we analyse the case of nine transboundary river basins in Sub-Saharan Africa to identify which water-management challenges are perceived as most important by the different riparian countries from a policy and scientific perspective. Our insights are based on the most up-to-date scientific papers, open access reports and technical literature, river basin authority's strategy papers, projects' summary reports, and national policy documents. We also complement these sources with the pieces of information we gained through collaborations with regional and local experts, and management bodies (such as river basin authorities). We highlight the current water-related conflicts and the gap between the priorities identified by the scientific community and different riparian countries on how to tackle hydro-climatic change and improve food and energy security, human and environmental health. Based on our experience, we discuss some keys to building trust among stakeholders, strengthening cooperation, and identifying shared water-governance measures in transboundary river basins. They are: (i) connect science and policy to provide sound knowledge for the right questions, (ii) value local knowledge and exploit the complementarity of different perspectives, (iii) consider multiple spatial scales and multi-level stakeholders to leave no one behind, (iv) promote a culture which values trade-offs and handles complexity, and (v) co-create data and knowledge to facilitate stakeholder dialogue from problem definition to intervention identification.

AB  - Municipal solid waste composting is seen as a promising technology in Sub-Saharan Africa to offset greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) program. The main reasons given therefore are the large organic fraction in municipal solid waste in this world region and the low complexity of the technology. The investigation results of case studies from other world regions suggest that the knowledge of local stakeholders involved in CDM composting projects is another crucial factor for their success and sustainability. The existing knowledge and knowledge demand of these stakeholders, however, is rarely considered in CDM composting project design documents from Sub-Saharan Africa. The study presented in the article at hand aimed to investigate both the existing knowledge and knowledge gaps of local stakeholders in a CDM waste composting project implemented in 17 cities in the Sub-Saharan African country of Uganda. This was done by selecting one of these cities (Busia) as a case study. After identifying the most important local stakeholders, methods of data collection and analysis (i.e. interviews, focus group discussions, compost field tests, material flow analysis, and full cost accounting) were embedded in an action research framework and applied to the case study of Busia prior to implementation of the CDM project. Furthermore, ways of closing the knowledge gaps identified were elaborated. Results showed that city authorities implementing and operating the CDM composting project, as well as farmers as potential users of the compost, were the two most relevant stakeholder groups. For city authorities, a knowledge gap regarding the net costs and benefits associated with the CDM project was identified, due to the underestimation of operation costs for composting and the overestimation of revenues from compost sales in the CDM project design document. The overestimation of compost sales revenues was due to the non-existence of a compost market, explained by the lack of experience and knowledge of farmers with respect to compost use and its value. While this knowledge among farmers can be acquired, for instance by means of agricultural extension services, key factors for marketing the compost, such as appropriate compost prices and compost quality, must also be addressed as part of a comprehensive solution. Investigations like the one presented in the article at hand are important not only for future CDM composting projects in Sub-Saharan African countries, but also for designing greenhouse gas mitigation programs under the green climate fund in the post-CDM period, as stipulated in the Paris Convention of Parties 21 Agreement.

AB  - Background Home care is beset with work environment issues and high staff turnover, while research concerned with interventions to improve the work environment is sparse. Few of the existing interventions apply a participative approach, despite this being associated with more positive outcomes and sustainable change. This paper presents a framework, rooted in action research and action learning, for participatory work environment interventions in home care, and demonstrates how this framework has been implemented in four Swedish home care organizations. Methods The framework has three phases (pre-intervention, intervention planning and intervention implementation) and consists of cycles of action and reflection in three constellations: a group of researchers, a reference group with labour market organization representatives and home care managers, and intervention work groups in the home care organizations. The work was documented and analysed with focus on the realization of the framework and challenges that were met on the way. The interventions were evaluated using a pre-/post-test questionnaire design. Results Parts of the framework were successfully implemented. The pre-intervention phase and the intervention planning phase, with intervention work groups, worked well. All four groups identified one intervention relevant to their own context. However, only two of the proposed interventions were fully implemented and evaluated. The high staff and management turnover, and the high rate of organizational changes made it impossible to evaluate the interventions statistically. Yet, data from open-ended questions in the post questionnaire showed that the two implemented interventions were perceived as successful. Conclusions The participatory framework, presented in this paper, seems promising for work environment interventions in home care. The framework was designed to reduce the risk of known disturbances affecting the process in unstable organizations. Despite this, it proved challenging to execute the framework, and especially the interventions, due to changes happening at high speed. In the two cases where organizational changes were not dominating, the interventions were implemented successfully. While the prerequisites for participation and successful implementation could be improved somewhat, the main issue, the instability of the organizational context, is hard for researchers or the individual home care units to tackle alone.

To balance the economic, social, and environmental dimensions of sustainable development, the United Nations adopted several sustainable developmental goals (SDGs), such as SDG 11 for sustainable cities and communities, which aims to improve urban planning and management, including equitable access to urban nature. However, more information is still needed regarding how planners and managers can promote urban nature visitation and equitable access during health and environmental crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose of this study was to examine trends in urban nature visitation during the pandemic and then to determine if the effect of the pandemic on the frequency of urban nature site visitation varied by distance to home, using an innovative approach of analyzing both publicly available large-scale mobility data and a web-based survey of urban residents of Tel Aviv-Yafo, Israel. The mobility data results showed that there was a negative mean % difference in park visits compared to baseline during the first and third lockdowns, but an increase compared to baseline between lockdowns and even during the second lockdown. This suggests that urban residents had greater need to reconnect with urban nature during and after periods of intense stress. In addition, the survey results showed an increasing negative effect of distance on urban nature site visitation during the pandemic, specifically for urban nature sites located more than 1 km from home. Altogether, the mobility data and survey results suggest that people who lived within 1 km of their preferred urban nature site had disproportionate access to the benefits of urban nature during and after lockdowns than others. To effectively make social and ecological transitions toward urban sustainability, it is vital that cities promote urban nature accessibility during current and future environmental and health crises. Cities should collaborate with diverse stakeholders to create/maintain accessible urban nature sites nearby all sociodemographic groups, provide sustainability education and training to convey the benefits of urban nature, and pursue participatory solutions for understanding urban nature needs and preferences. In this manner, it will be possible to address the growing influence of proximity/travel distance and additional factors that affect urban nature visitation and ultimately, human health and urban sustainability.

AB  - The focus of the Special Feature on "Multicriteria assessment of food system sustainability" is on the complex challenges of making and communicating overall assessments of food systems sustainability based on multiple and varied criteria. Four papers concern the choice and development of appropriate tools for making multicriteria sustainability assessments that handle built-in methodological conflicts and trade-offs between different assessment objectives. They underscore the value of linking diverse methods and tools, or nesting and stepping their deployment, to help build resilience and sustainability. They conclude that there is no one tool, one framework, or one indicator set that is appropriate for the different purposes and contexts of sustainability assessment. The process of creating the assessment framework also emerges as important: if the key stakeholders are not given a responsible and full role in the development of any assessment tool, it is less likely to be fit for their purpose and they are unlikely to take ownership or have confidence in it. Six other papers reflect on more fundamental considerations of how assessments are based in different scientific perspectives and on the role of values, motivation, and trust in relation to assessments in the development of more sustainable food systems. They recommend a radical break with the tradition of conducting multicriteria assessment from one hegemonic perspective to considering multiple perspectives. Collectively the contributions to this Special Feature identify three main challenges for improved multicriteria assessment of food system sustainability: (i) how to balance different types of knowledge to avoid that the most well-known, precise, or easiest to measure dimensions of sustainability gets the most weight; (ii) how to expose the values in assessment tools and choices to allow evaluation of how they relate to the ethical principles of sustainable food systems, to societal goals, and to the interests of different stakeholders; and (iii) how to enable communication in such a way that the assessments can effectively contribute to the development of more sustainable food systems by facilitating a mutual learning process between researchers and stakeholders. The wider question of how to get from assessment to transformation goes across all three challenges. We strongly recommend future research on the strengths, weaknesses, and complementarities of taking a values-based rather than a performance-based approach to promoting the resilience and sustainability of coupled ecological, economic, and social systems for ensuring food security and agroecosystem health in the coming millennium.

AB  - The Sustainable Development Goals were designed by the United Nations to help all organizations understand that any development must be balanced with the three pillars of sustainability: society, economy, and environment. Therefore, every organization must be more vigilant before introducing something that could have social consequences. This study aims to investigate all of the necessary components for proposing and establishing a community sustainability ecosystem model that supports local business sustainability with participation by highlighting essential variables that foster sustainable business prospects. The researcher distributed a questionnaire on a five-point Likert scale to 1,000 community water users in Thailand and received 627 valid responses. Using a simple random sampling technique with a sampling ratio of 14 villages, data was obtained. Subsequently, descriptive statistics are used to characterize the data (frequency distributions, percentages, averages, medians, and standard deviations). Furthermore, PLS-SEM was used to examine the relationships between factors and to launch the conceptual model using PLS path modeling. This study aimed to enhance the original Commitment-Trust theory relying on sustainability by examining the relationships between accepted variables pertaining to change agents, stakeholders, transparency, social networking, and good governance in order to provide new knowledge to the sustainability community and local sustainability businesses. In addition, this conceptual model can be applied to new business cases in which businesses need a framework that can be followed rapidly and reduces the danger of making mistakes on their own. In light of these considerations, this article proposes a novel community sustainability ecosystem model that may be adopted by the majority of businesses as a framework for managing the entire firm. Not only does it aid local businesses, but it can also adapt to any business change in order to become more profitable and sustainable.

AB  - Purpose Covid-19 outbreak has compelled the world-wide education system to use the digital collaboration platform (DCP) for online learning, for robust inclusive sustainable education. The purpose of this paper is to understand the adoption intention and effectiveness of DCP using technology acceptance model (TAM) for online learning among students studying in higher education institutes (HEIs) in India. Design/methodology/approach A structured questionnaire has been adopted to survey and collect data from 324 students studying in HEI of Maharashtra state in India. The questionnaire consisted of 28 constructs. The constructs in this section were measured using a five-point Likert scale ranging. In the first step, first-order confirmatory factor analysis is carried out by using the software IBM AMOS-20. The initial model is generated for six constructs, and outcomes are used to analyze the model's goodness of fit and construct validity. In second step, structural equation modelling is carried out to do the path analysis of the proposed model. Findings The findings connote that the interactivity, cost-effectiveness and the core TAM constructs as perceived usefulness form positive attitude towards usage of DCP and intention to adopt it in near future by the students of HEI of India. The research is an attempt to provide possible explanations for the epochal relationships between the constructs and discusses the usage of information, which can be further used to enhance the acceptance of DCP among students in urban as well as rural India. Research limitations/implications The results and findings will provide a direction to the various stakeholders such as educators, management, learners and the parents on the adoption intention of digital collaborative platform from a learner's point of view. This will lead to the knowledge which will help in practical implementations of these technologies.

AB  - BackgroundRefugees, asylum seekers, and migrants without status experience precarious living and working conditions that disproportionately expose them to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In the two most populous Canadian provinces (Quebec and Ontario), to reduce the vulnerability factors experienced by the most marginalized migrants, the public and community sectors engage in joint coordination efforts called intersectoral collaboration. This collaboration ensures holistic care provisioning, inclusive of psychosocial support, assistance to address food security, and educational and employment assistance. This research project explores how community and public sectors collaborated on intersectoral initiatives during the COVID-19 pandemic to support refugees, asylum seekers, and migrants without status in the cities of Montreal, Sherbrooke, and Toronto, and generates lessons for a sustainable response to the heterogeneous needs of these migrants.MethodsThis theory-informed participatory research is co-created with socioculturally diverse research partners (refugees, asylum seekers and migrants without status, employees of community organizations, and employees of public organizations). We will utilize Mirzoev and Kane's framework on health systems' responsiveness to guide the four phases of a qualitative multiple case study (a case being an intersectoral initiative). These phases will include (1) building an inventory of intersectoral initiatives developed during the pandemic, (2) organizing a deliberative workshop with representatives of the study population, community, and public sector respondents to select and validate the intersectoral initiatives, (3) interviews (n = 80) with community and public sector frontline workers and managers, municipal/regional/provincial policymakers, and employees of philanthropic foundations, and (4) focus groups (n = 80) with refugees, asylum seekers, and migrants without status. Qualitative data will be analyzed using thematic analysis. The findings will be used to develop discussion forums to spur cross-learning among service providers.DiscussionThis research will highlight the experiences of community and public organizations in their ability to offer responsive services for refugees, asylum seekers, and migrants without status in the context of a pandemic. We will draw lessons learnt from the promising practices developed in the context of COVID-19, to improve services beyond times of crisis. Lastly, we will reflect upon our participatory approach-particularly in relation to the engagement of refugees and asylum seekers in the governance of our research.

AB  - Background: Starting in 1999, Concern Worldwide Inc. (Concern) worked with two Bangladeshi municipal health departments to support delivery of maternal and child health preventive services. A mid-term evaluation identified sustainability challenges. Concern relied on systems thinking implicitly to re-prioritize sustainability, but stakeholders also required a method, an explicit set of processes, to guide their decisions and choices during and after the project.
   Methods: Concern chose the Sustainability Framework method to generate creative thinking from stakeholders, create a common vision, and monitor progress. The Framework is based on participatory and iterative steps: defining (mapping) the local system and articulating a long-term vision, describing scenarios for achieving the vision, defining the elements of the model, and selecting corresponding indicators, setting and executing an assessment plan,, and repeated stakeholder engagement in analysis and decisions. Formal assessments took place up to 5 years post-project (2009).
   Results: Strategic choices for the project were guided by articulating a collective vision for sustainable health, mapping the system of actors required to effect and sustain change, and defining different components of analysis. Municipal authorities oriented health teams toward equity-oriented service delivery efforts, strengthening of the functionality of Ward Health Committees, resource leveraging between municipalities and the Ministry of Health, and mitigation of contextual risks. Regular reference to a vision (and set of metrics (population health, organizational and community capacity) mitigated political factors. Key structures and processes were maintained following elections and political changes. Post-project achievements included the maintenance or improvement 5 years post-project (2009) in 9 of the 11 health indicator gains realized during the project (1999-2004). Some elements of performance and capacity weakened, but reductions in the equity gap achieved during the project were largely maintained post-project.
   Conclusions: Sustainability is dynamic and results from local systems processes, which can be strengthened through both implicit and explicit systems thinking steps applied with constancy of purpose.

AB  - In order to achieve the autonomous community's main objective of internal territorial cohesion and an effective connection with the exterior, the authorities deployed plan-ning policies based on the precepts of modernity, recognition of diversity and favoring decentralized decisions, especially in terms of urban planning and spatial planning. In only a few decades, this generated a complete and novel framework for action (Cruz, 2018; Rando, 2019).However, over the years and through the consolidation of the system in its current characteristics, this legislative and planning panorama has evolved towards policies of a marked conformist nature, legitimizing previous trends in the territory and reinforcing centralism in decisions and investments (Martin & Jurado, 2018). Along with this and with the course of the political legislatures, there has been an evident distance between the theoretical proposal of the law and it's inevitable reality, in addition to multiplying the cases of dysfunctionality in the application of both frameworks of action (Zoido, 1998; Gorgolas, 2019).The hypothesis of this research stems from the idea that it is possible to recognize the dysfunctions in the application of urban planning and spatial planning policies in Andalusia by analyzing their practice and performance in the case of mid-sized cities. The lessons learned from this analysis can be extrapolated to the set of policies that influence territorial planning and management, and help to generate more sustainable and smart management alternatives. Therefore, the main objective of this paper is to recognize, from a multidisciplinary analytical perspective, the trends and conflicts that have taken place throughout the de-velopment of the autonomous community of Andalusia, from the perspective of the dis-ciplines of land use planning and urban planning. First, by identifying and evaluating the deployment of competences, their legal framework of reference and the instruments that each discipline had. This will allow for the establishment of an evolutionary and compara-tive analysis between the trajectories of both disciplines and their legislative results, from which the tools generated from each focus of territorial intervention and their participation in achieving a sustainable territorial model for the community are analyzed. The focus of this study is not carried out exclusively on the theoretical plane, but rather concentrates on a case study of mid-sized cities, a genuinely Mediterranean urban phenomenon that, due to its massive presence and specific weight in the regional territorial reality, serves as a preferred setting and thread of the analysis.For this, based on a recognition of the legislative, planning and conceptual frame-work of reference for the autonomous community, and integrating an analysis of the current dimension of the phenomenon of the mid-sized city in the region, diagnostic scales and dimensions are superimposed that allow the identification of the dysfunc-tions and interfering factors that take place between both disciplines in their practice and deployment, as well as the impact that this panorama has on sustainable urban and territorial management.All of the above allows us to reach some conclusions that are debated and con-textualized in their scientific framework of reference.Observing the results of decades of actions in this field, it is not risky to affirm that, in the case of the autonomous community of Andalusia, the entire territorial planning system has largely lost the direction to follow.
   This is due to the fact that the main his-torical motivation has been irretrievably altered, that which was committed to sustain -ability, territorial balance or to achieving a higher quality of life for its inhabitants through a better managed territory. And in this future there is, unquestionably, a leading actor: the autonomous public administration itself, with its non-compliance, countermeasures and continuous changes in criteria. And this without forgetting, of course, the attitude of local government entities, responsible to undertake a reckless fight against territorial planning in general, and reluctant to any alternative way of practicing urban planning. In short, the data describe a reality marked by the poor operation of the established legislative and planning framework, which, in the particular case of Andalusia, in addition to being saturated with poorly resolved overlaps, is a victim of the lack of ambition and commitment of the autonomous community. All this takes place despite the hyperactivity of the legislation and the successive approvals of large planning packages during some historical periods.Overall, and in view of the great legal and instrumental development that this issue achieves in the current legal system, it is verified that in this case the instrumental and procedural materialization of the legislation, either lacks application, or its functions and motivational principles are executed in a distorted manner, generating a situation marked by the powerlessness of the instruments in charge of executing those precepts and models on reality.In this scenario, spatial planning, which has been proposed since its inception as a comprehensive, transversal and purposeful tool, has been wandering vaguely in its own legal and legislative implementation, until becoming a physical order of land uses, relegating these to the permitted and prohibited activities on non-urbanizable land, and in some typologies, urbanizable. Urban planning, on the contrary, a perennial image of public control and private profit in the exploitation of the land, maintaining its strength and social presence, even exceeding its particular objectives and invading, either due to negligence or for the convenience of responsible supervisors, the function and practice of those disciplines such as spatial planning, which are theoretically designed to accom-pany their meaning and functionality, and which, from the beginning, were erroneously conceived as threats to their omnipotence.All this prevents, in a correlative way, the main articulating component of the city sys-tem-the mid-sized cities-, from becoming empowered and positioned as the leading agent in development processes. These cities, instead of participating in the system assuming their role as urban centers guaranteeing territorial balance, or directly as protagonists of territorial networks to strengthen development processes-a vision advocated by spatial planning-, have done so on the contrary, uncritically accepting a diminished version of this role: they are only medium-sized municipalities concerned with their share of local power consolidated through poorly understood urban planning. For this reason and as previously warned, not all responsibility for the consecration of this scenario should lie with the autonomous administration: the mid-sized cities of Andalusia demonstrate that they have not understood their potential leading role in territorial management.
   All this supposes, in short, a new setback and an awkward recognition of one of the most genuine patrimonial components of Andalusia: the intermediate segment of the urban system. And, therefore, it is understood as a new lost opportunity in the process of implementing a true and effective territorial cohesion in the region.

AB  - About the case: This case study examines how students, instructors, and industry partners in university and industry collaborative translation projects perceive and respond to their experiences with these projects. It reports on collaborative translation projects at Xi'an International Studies University, involving the active participation of three stakeholders. Situating the case: Translation and technical and professional communication (TPC) education both prioritize cultivating students' practical skills of producing audience-centered content. They both value collaborative approaches as effective methods for bridging the gap between academia and industry. Although TPC education aims to foster students' technical and professional writing competence and prepare them for industry demands, translation education focuses on developing students' translation competence through context-dependent learning. Various models have been proposed to define translation competence, with the multicomponent model being the most prominent. This model emphasizes multiple skills and attributes that translators need, reflecting the influence of market demands and technological advancements. Collaborative approaches like project-based learning (PjBL) have been advocated to bridge the gap between academia and industry. However, research at the program level and from stakeholders' perspectives remains limited. Methods: We adopted a mixed-method strategy and employed surveys and one-on-one interviews to examine the responses from the stakeholders about their experiences and the impacts of the collaborative translation projects. Results: Statistical analysis of the surveys and thematic analysis of interviews and open-ended questions indicate that all stakeholders concur with the projects' benefits in enhancing students' translation competence and shortening the gap between classroom translation education and market demands. Despite these benefits, all stakeholders face various challenges that should be addressed by expanding the scalability and sustainability of collaborative projects, fostering closer and direct collaboration between instructors and industry partners, and enhancing the ethics of professional code and strategic competence of students. Conclusion: Based on the research results, we suggest further research directed at the sustainability of these projects and the scalability of their benefits toward a bigger population of students.

AB  - This work proposes a framework for co-designing decision-support tools for sustainable land management and soil protection at multiple scales. Geospatial dashboards, due to their key capabilities in the use of spatial or geospatial information, are quickly gaining traction for planning and policymaking. Developing the decision-support system (DSS) as a transversal system capable of capturing trends in land and soil properties at the local, regional, national, and EU levels has been co-designed with policy stakeholders. This work seeks to link (i) the main goal of the Soil Mission and the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), to raise awareness and knowledge on soil conditions (ii) and the LANDSUPPORT (LS) project cross-evaluation on how the spatial decision-support system (SDSS) can support policy-related stakeholders and help them to take evidence-based decisions. To achieve this objective, we present the user engagement process to ensure broad testing and evaluation of the LS SDSS's ability to support selected EU policies and soil-related SDGs by testing the LS platform's European scale tools, including an analysis and conformity check of the data delivered by the LS tools and a critical review of results. The indicators were assessed via direct contact with end users, such as semi-structured interviews (SSI) and 184 questionnaires. Results of the test series have been analyzed by the spatial scale per respective tool and performance indicators. We present a unique, integrated, science-based approach to co-create data-driven decision-making with the stakeholders to promote sustainable land management practices. This methodology strives to involve many stakeholders in scientific research, empowering them to participate in the decisions on topics that directly affect them. Public bodies responsible for land policy implementation, environmental stakeholders, spatial planners, and other users have engaged in the process to ensure broad testing of the LS platform from 2020 to 2022. A strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis provided a synthesis of the performance of the LS tools. The testing phase proved the utmost importance of usability, underlining that the mixed method of testing allowing quantitative and qualitative analyses based on the same key indicators proved essential for co-designing SDSS tools to be used by a wide range of stakeholders.

AB  - The phase of the eight millennium development goals (MDGs) adopted by the United Nations at the beginning of 2000 has given way to the program of seventeen sustainable development goals (SDGs) ratified in 2015, to be implemented until 2030. While the number of SDGs is more than twice that of MDGs and more comprehensive in outlook, examination of the individual goals indicates that most if not all of the SDGs are either directly related to environmental sustainability or indirectly concerned with the quality of the environment. This is not surprising because nations have realized, if somewhat late, that human well-being cannot be dissociated from the quality of ecosystems. The escalating global environmental crisis threatens economic and social stability and makes the innate human desire for happiness even more difficult to attain. The issue, moreover, has grown into something that cannot be confined to a single or even a few sectors of society, or that can be adequately addressed by politicians or scientists alone. Rather, achieving environmental sustainability, which is an essential component of the SDGs program, requires an interdisciplinary, dialectical, and dialogical approach involving a diverse collection of individuals, groups, organizations, and institutions. Political will, social and economic reforms, scientific and technological know-how, and religious and personal commitment are all part of the effort to address the environmental woes of the modern era. The role and contribution of religious systems and traditions for the achievement of SDGs, particularly in Asia, is the focus of this chapter. This chapter aims to present the following: (1) stating the reasons why religion is essential to the aspirations of the SDGs in Asia and (2) exploring how the major religions in Asia can contribute to promoting environmental sustainability by providing a framework for (a) assessing the root cause of environmental destruction; (b) envisioning a religious-based approach to how human beings could relate to the natural environment; and (c) presenting how religion promotes harmonious human-nature relationship through a program of self-cultivation and self-transformation. This chapter hopes to demonstrate that the task of achieving the SDGs in Asia is tied with the concern of religion and progress depends greatly on the improved state of human moral and spiritual well-being that religion aims to promote.

AB  - Purpose This study aims to explore the strategies corporations use in engaging stakeholders to sustain healthy corporate partnerships and create value for the corporate entity and the society in which they operate and their influence on the corporate manager's cognitive abilities and decision-making. Design/methodology/approach The authors used an interpretive research approach leveraging the strengths of qualitative method of content analysis and comparative and critical analyses to report the results. Interpretive methods incorporate social theories and standpoints that view reality as the social construction of understandable events in the context of organizational communication. Findings The findings of this study suggest that corporations are assumed to follow and execute the principles of engaging stakeholders to achieve corporate social responsibility (CSR) claiming to manage a sustainable and responsible business practices that recognize local cultures, human rights and protect the environment. However, little attention has been paid to the cognitive reasoning of the individuals responsible for CSR and corporate sustainability (CS) as opposed to the growing concerns about strategies corporations use in engaging stakeholders to sustain healthy corporate partnerships and create value - especially the processes that take place during engagement and decision-making including cognitive offloading. Practical implications Stakeholder engagement requires practical approaches that enable corporations and individuals charged with decision-making responsibilities to understand, respond and fulfill their CSRs. To achieve CSRs, corporations and managers responsible for relevant decision-making would need to involve stakeholders in social performance planning, as social reporting/auditing has long been advocating for preventing managerial biasness, groupthink and increased information dissemination via detailed reporting practices toward more collaborative stakeholder relationships. Thus, it is crucial for corporations to implement enhanced stakeholder and managerial decision-making strategies such as integrative approaches to achieve balance in the trio elements of sustainability as well as the growing use of paradox perspective to understand the nature of the tensions being sought to balance and, in the process, provide opportunity for a better evaluation of complex sustainability issues for innovative approach to resolving them. While cognitive decision-making is at play, in practice, managers tasked with making decisions must ensure the most effective stakeholder engagement strategies that are transparent and inclusive are used. Originality/value The main contribution of this study is its argument regarding the tools corporations use in engaging key stakeholders and the cognitive reasoning of the individuals responsible for CSR and CS. The study further contributes to interpreting the integrative approach to achieving balance in the trio elements of sustainability as well as the growing use of paradox perspective to understand the nature of the tensions being sought to balance and, in the process, provide an opportunity for a better evaluation of complex sustainability issues for an innovative approach to resolving them.

AB  - CONTEXT: Early generation seed (EGS) production and delivery pathways are critical components of so-called formal seed systems, of principal importance in the release of improved varieties into national seed systems. Vegetatively propagated crops (VPCs), with clonal reproductive ability and considerable differences in production and dissemination patterns from sexually propagated crops, often challenge generalized assumptions about 'business models' for private sector-led EGS production. OBJECTIVE: We evaluate production trends and institutional arrangements for early generation 'seed' (stem cutting) production in the Greater Mekong Subregion of Southeast Asia to compare models, stakeholders, production pathways, and economic efficiency. We systematically document three cases of formal EGS production underpinning this globally important agricultural commodity, and contextualize their development in regional cassava production trends. We then interrogate whether the observed models support common assumptions in contemporary debates about how VPC seed system development, in particular the logic of public and private participation. METHODS: To contextualize EGS initiatives, we compiled district-level production data and processing factory locations from national sources across the Greater Mekong subregion, paired with data on varietal releases and international trade of cassava products. To evaluate institutional arrangements for cassava EGS production in this context, we conducted ten key informant interviews with stakeholders involved with three case studies in Cambodia, Thailand, and Vietnam. Using a seed value chains framework, we compared institutional participation, seed multiplication practices, and partial budgets of each case. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The three cases represent diverse institutional arrangements that don't exhibit seed company-led, profit-motivated structures often recommended by experts. Despite the commercial nature of export-oriented Southeast Asian cassava products, public involvement remained central in cassava breeding and EGS delivery models, implemented via different actors and multiplication stages. Case histories and partial production budgets describe institutional arrangements with variable points of subsidy along the value chain, resulting in positive effects on varietal turnover and cassava production across the region. SIGNIFICANCE: While private sector involvement was significant and variable, public involvement remains important, even for highly commercialized crops like cassava. Contrary to common assumptions, successful cassava EGS systems in Southeast Asia have initiated impressive impacts without pursuing conventionally profit-oriented seed business models. Value chain approaches reveal backing EGS yields tangible downstream benefits, but for VPCs additional innovations are required to ensure benefits support the sustainability of expensive upstream multiplication stages. Approaches considering institutional participation along seed and product value chains can identify mechanisms for doing so beyond conventional seed commercialization.

AB  - Wetland ecosystems are highly complex in production and the extent of plant and animal diversity. The study assessed the role that various stakeholders play in the sustainable use and conservation of particularly urban wetlands. The specific objectives of the study were to establish threats to the sustainable use of the Monavale Wetland; determine wetland conservation strategies adopted; and examine the role of stakeholders in wetland use and conservation. This study adopted a combination of quantitative and qualitative research methods to expand and enhance the quality of the results obtained. A questionnaire was adopted to collect data from 90 household heads or their proxies using random sampling. Additionally, semi structured interviews were used to obtain information from Environ-mental Management Agency (EMA), Conservation Society of Monavale (COSMO) and Ram-sar Zimbabwe. Qualitative data were analysed using the content analysis method whereas descriptive and inferential statistics were used for quantitative data. Findings demonstrate that 63% agreed that the government has fostered and strengthened private partnerships that benefit the wetland. Only 40% of respondents from Monavale agreed that the local government has developed effective conservation policies. Residents in the areas surround-ing the marsh were named as stakeholders by 98% of those who responded to the ques-tionnaires. In conclusion, the research shows that stakeholders play a pivotal and essential role in wetland use and conservation if sustainability is to be achieved. The study therefore recommends that the Government invests in programs that involve various stakeholders in policy development and implementation. This study will at the end propose a framework to enhance sustainable use of wetlands and proffer wetland conservation.(c) 2023 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of African Institute of Mathematical Sciences / Next Einstein Initiative.

AB  - Purpose This paper aims to evaluate the collaboration quality performance of sugar company Z and its stakeholders (farmers and distributors) by considering the sustainability aspects. This assessment shall be able to integrate qualitative and quantitative factors in the model, which is critical in sugar supply chains involving multi-stakeholders. Design/methodology/approach Integration of quality function deployment (QFD), the fuzzy analytical network process (FANP) and the data envelopment analysis (DEA) is administered to assess the efficiency score of each stakeholder involved. The evaluation encompasses collaboration behaviour factors since the input of collaboration activities will result in sustainability aspects such as revenue, green house gas (GHG) emissions and social impact. The analysis has been conducted in two scenarios, those are the basic scenario by utilising original data and the extended scenario by using projection data. Findings The result clarifies that the most influential behaviour factor in the collaboration activities is commitment (0.116), while the least important behaviour factors are power (0.008) and adaptation (0.008). Furthermore, by using the extended scenario, the overall efficiency for each benchmarking is higher compared to the condition before the improvement (basic scenario). Research limitations/implications The result of this study is only relevant to the particular sugar supply chain and involving limited sustainability variables. Therefore, in a further study, more variables such as technical and financial aspects could be explored further in the assessment process. Practical implications The result of this study is available for each stakeholder and can be fundamental for the constant improvement in sustainable supply chain (SSC) practices. It shows that an improvement of one stakeholder will positively impact the entire system. Social implications Smallholders and sugarcane farmers will recognise the significance of collaboration behaviour. Thus, they can enhance their mutual benefits by using the existing resources. Originality/value This paper arranges for a practical contribution by implementing advanced assessment methods in the sugar supply chain by taking into account the economic, environmental and social aspects. This comprehensive assessment process in the sugar supply chain is the novelty of this paper.

AB  - Forest certification as a voluntary verification tool has been providing an independent assessment of sustainable forestry practices and thus confidence in sustainability benchmarks for over 20 years. Using either the international or national approaches and initiatives, two main forest certification systems, PEFC (Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification) and FSC (Forest Stewardship Council), have spread in a number of countries worldwide. The specifics of local conditions in the forestry sector have to be taken into account when implementing the certification context in a given country or a region. Apart from the natural conditions, institutional structure, or legislative framework, it is also the local and national stakeholders and their perception of this issue that provides the background for the implementation of the certification criteria. The main objective of this study is to examine the general understanding of the certification concept as an environmental, economic, and social tool, and to determine the incentives of forest owners in Slovakia for sustainable forest management (SFM) certification. In addition, the benefits and problems arising from participation in certification were identified and differences reflecting the ownership structure of forests, size of forest area, and participation in a particular certification programme were analysed. Results indicate that certified forest owners, unlike non-certified, demonstrated a high level of understanding of the SFM certification concept. Certified entities mainly consider forest certification as their commitment to environmental responsibility and a tool for improving external company image, promoting sustainable utilisation of forest resources, and improving forest management practices. The main benefits are linked to the possibility to demonstrate forest management practices, a better understanding of the forest management concept, and improvement of forest management practices. PEFC users perceive more benefits following from certification; the most important are those associated with non-economic values, while FSC-certified forest owners perceive mainly economic benefits connected to market penetration, increased sales volume, and potential price premiums. The key problems associated with certification relate to duties to ensure compliance with certification criteria by contractors and administrative difficulties. Respondents reported minimum price premiums for the sale of their certified timber. Additionally, the findings of the study pointed out that a nationally developed certification system can better recognise the roles and objectives of forest certification in the context of forest policy.

AB  - The Research Institute for Sustainability Science and Technology under the Master degree in Sustainability Science and Technology organises the course action research workshop on Science and Technology for Sustainability (5 ECTS). The authors have been coordinating the course during the academic years 13/14, 14/15 and 15/16. The purpose of the workshop is to put together civil society organisations, local administrations, students and educators to collaboratively undertake responsible research, performing transdisciplinary learning environments and by an action research framework, to answer questions such as: Who are we researching for? Who profits from our research? What are the impacts of our research? Which methodologies and tools should be used when dealing with sociotechnical sustainability challenges? Students work on real projects, related to local sustainability problems, represented by a community entity (Service learning and Campus Lab). Action research methodology is used with a two-cycle approach. In each real-life project, students, faculty and stakeholders are asked to follow the action-reflexion process of action research projects: Action 1-Jointly defining: Project purpose; Customer and interest; Involved actors; Reflexion 1-Students define: research question, initial situation, needed additional information, action Strategy, Tasks planning and distribution: Action 2-Items returning and discussing with stakeholders, Reflexion 2-Revising and reformulating. Having now run the workshop three times, we can conclude that: first, students realised the significance of framing an investigation under a research methodological framework that allows bringing research to the community, enhancing transdisciplinarity in any initiative or action in sustainability science. They set out the importance of some topics and the difficulty to hold them. Second, the formulation of the problem became one of the most arduous tasks in the process; difficulties were mainly related to the perception of the problem from distinct community group motivations. Third, interaction and communication with stakeholders and the recognition of their role was problematic as engineering students are not usually trained to work in wicked problems nor accompany stakeholders during the whole process. Finally, it is relevant to highlight that during the process students faced conflict and frustrating situations both within their team and with stakeholders. To help tackle this problem, an Emotional Intelligence module was introduced in the workshop which proved useful in helping students to solve some paralysing situations, which could otherwise have stopped the progress of the project. We suggest that engineering students need specific training in transdisciplinary research and in conflict resolution, to avoid collapsing in frustration when dealing with real transdisciplinary sustainability transitions.

AB  - The Internet revolution has led to the advancement of online business all over the world. The environmental, social, and economic aspects are significant to the e-commerce sector, on both the retailer and consumer sides. It cannot be over-emphasized how important the sustainability of e-commerce in all three dimensions is. E-commerce will allow consumers to shop online easily, at any hour of the day, using secure payment systems; furthermore, trust in retailers' websites is of paramount importance to consumers. This calls our attention to the gap in previous studies, and consequently, the purpose of this study is to fill the gap, to ensure sustainable e-commerce in three dimensions; environmental, social, and economic. The question and aim under investigation are: How to integrate three dimensions into e-commerce to ensure that sustainability is achieved now and for future generations, while thriving as an industry? Collaboration is required, and all stakeholders in the virtual market must take appropriate responsibility. The methodology adopted is a review of previous studies done on each individual dimension of sustainability, since no joint studies have been carried out and integrated into the same literature framework. Furthermore, a case study involving companies in Kenya and Jordan is used in order to collect empirical data. The findings of the study show that: First, integration is essential for the sustainability of e-commerce in its three dimensions; second, trade-offs must be taken in the various dimensions in order for companies to realize sustainable e-commerce. This will go in hand with the realization of the maximum benefits of integrating the three dimensions in e-commerce to make it more sustainable. In conclusion, by applying these aspects of sustainability in e-commerce, it is clear that everyone wins. This is achieved by improving and safeguarding the quality of life by protecting the environment, preserving natural resources, and maintaining and sustaining the economy. The implications of the study are that, in order to make e-commerce more sustainable, to make decisions and take action, social/environmental/economic aspects must be considered as a fundamental element, and must be treated as a group and not separately as in previous studies. In this way, we can realize greater benefits, not only in online business sustainability, but also in policy-making and environmental protection, while companies will create economic value as well as avoiding labor unrest.

AB  - Introduction and method
   Africa is currently host to a number of international genomics research and biobanking consortia, each with a mandate to advance genomics research and biobanking in Africa. Whilst most of these consortia promise to transform the way international health research is done in Africa, few have articulated exactly how they propose to go about this. In this paper, we report on a qualitative interviewing study in which we involved 17 genomics researchers in Africa. We describe their perceptions and expectations of international genomics research and biobanking initiatives in Africa.
   Results
   All interviewees were of the view that externally funded genomics research and biobanking initiatives in Africa, have played a critical role in building capacity for genomics research and biobanking in Africa and in providing an opportunity for researchers in Africa to collaborate and network with other researchers. Whilst the opportunity to collaborate was seen as a benefit, some interviewees stressed the importance of recognizing that these collaborations carry mutual benefits for all partners, including their collaborators in HICs. They also voiced two major concerns of being part of these collaborative initiatives: the possibility of exploitation of African researchers and the non-sustainability of research capacity building efforts. As a way of minimising exploitation, researchers in Africa recommended that genuine efforts be made to create transparent and equitable international health research partnerships. They suggested that this could be achieved through,: having rules of engagement, enabling African researchers to contribute to the design and conduct of international health projects in Africa, and mutual and respectful exchange of experience and capacity between research collaborators. These were identified as hallmarks to equitable international health research collaborations in Africa.
   Conclusion
   Genomics research and biobanking initiatives in Africa such as H3Africa have gone some way in defining aspects of fair and equitable research collaborations in Africa. However, they will need to strive at achieving equitable health research collaborations if they truly aim at setting a gold standard for how international health research should be conducted in Africa.

AB  - Several holistic approaches are based on the description of socio-ecological systems to address the sustainability challenge. Essential Variables (EVs) have the potential to support these approaches by describing the status of the Earth system through monitoring and modeling. The different classes of EVs can be organized along the environmental policy framework of Drivers, Pressures, States, Impacts and Responses. The EV concept represents an opportunity to strengthen monitoring systems by providing observations to seize the fundamental dimensions of the Earth system
   The Group on Earth Observation (GEO) is a partnership of 113 nations and 134 participating organizations in 2021 that are dedicated to making Earth Observation (EO) data available globally to inform about the state of the environment and enable data-driven decision processes. GEO is building the Global Earth Observation System of Systems, a set of coordinated and independent EO, information and processing systems that interoperate to provide access to EO for users in the public and private sectors. The progresses made in the development of various classes of EVs are described with their main policy targets, Internet links and key references
   The paper reviews the literature on EVs and describes the main contributions of the EU GEOEssential project to integrate EVs within the work plan of GEO in order to better address selected environmental policies and the SDGs. A new GEO-EVs community has been set to discuss about the current status of the EVs, exchange knowledge, experiences and assess the gaps to be solved in their communities of providers and users. A set of four traits characterizing an EV was put forward to describe the entire socio-ecological system of planet Earth: Essentiality, Evolvability, Unambiguity, and Feasibility. A workflow from the identification of EO data sources to the final visualization of SDG 15.3.1 indicators on land degradation is demonstrated, spanning through the use of different EVs, the definition of the knowledge base on this indicator, the implementation of the workflow in the VLab (a cloud-based processing infrastructure), the presentation of the outputs on a dedicated dashboard and the corresponding narrative through a story map.
   The concept of EV started in the climate sphere and spread to other domains of the earth system but less so in socio-economic activities. More work is therefore needed to converge on a common definition and criteria in order to complete the implementation of EVs in all GEO focus areas. EVs should screen the entire Earth's social-ecological system, providing a trusted and long-term foundation for interdisciplinary approaches such as ecological footprinting, planetary boundaries, disaster risk reduction, and nexus frameworks, as well as many other policy frameworks such as the SDGs

AB  - Background Few real-world examples exist of how best to select and adapt implementation strategies that promote sustainability. We used a collaborative care (CC) use case to describe a novel, theory-informed, stakeholder engaged process for operationalizing strategies for sustainability using a behavioral lens.
   Methods Informed by the Dynamic Sustainability Framework, we applied the Behaviour Change Wheel to our prior mixed methods to identify key sustainability behaviors and determinants of sustainability before specifying corresponding intervention functions, behavior change techniques, and implementation strategies that would be acceptable, equitable and promote key tenets of sustainability (i.e., continued improvement, education). Drawing on user-centered design principles, we enlisted 22 national and local stakeholders to operationalize and adapt (e.g., content, functionality, workflow) a multi-level, multi-component implementation strategy to maximally target behavioral and contextual determinants of sustainability.
   Results After reviewing the long-term impact of early implementation strategies (i.e., external technical support, quality monitoring, and reimbursement), we identified ongoing care manager CC delivery, provider treatment optimization, and patient enrollment as key sustainability behaviors. The most acceptable, equitable, and feasible intervention functions that would facilitate ongoing improvement included environmental restructuring, education, training, modeling, persuasion, and enablement. We determined that a waiting room delivered shared decision-making and psychoeducation patient tool (DepCare), the results of which are delivered to providers, as well as ongoing problem-solving meetings/local technical assistance with care managers would be the most acceptable and equitable multi-level strategy in diverse settings seeking to sustain CC programs. Key adaptations in response to dynamic contextual factors included expanding the DepCare tool to incorporate anxiety/suicide screening, triage support, multi-modal delivery, and patient activation (vs. shared decision making) (patient); pairing summary reports with decisional support and yearly onboarding/motivational educational videos (provider); incorporating behavioral health providers into problem-solving meetings and shifting from billing support to quality improvement and triage (system).
   Conclusion We provide a roadmap for designing behavioral theory-informed, implementation strategies that promote sustainability and employing user-centered design principles to adapt strategies to changing mental health landscapes.

AB  - This article emphasizes on the present urgent need to think in "Holistic Dimensions" to achieve a sustainable agro-ecosystem. In this respect, the complex network of dynamic interactions in the agro-ecosystem soil at spatiotemporal dimensions holds crucial importance. It reflects the inherent tendency of dynamic ecosystems to achieve a more efficient state successively through improved interactions. The shortsighted and inefficient agro-management during Green Revolution decades has been detrimental to these interactions in agricultural soils, which is widely evident by its boomerang effects (i.e. declining efficiency, productivity and multi-functionality). It jeopardized the internal regulation in our agro-ecosystem's functioning by erosion of efficiency building interactions among biotic and abiotic components. Therefore, a bottom-up as well as top-down approach in the soil management is required to restore and sustain the unaccounted but indispensible ecological subsidies for sustainable agriculture and development, globally. We propose a "commercial ecological agriculture" which should be an amalgamation of sustainable agricultural practices and supported by a progressive co-ordination among all the stakeholders via participatory learning and adaptation with time. It should be least-disturbing, resilience-building, resource (i.e. energy and nutrient) use efficient, site-specific, labor and skill-intensive, low-input, diversified and integrated, and intimately harmonized with nature. It may potentially provide us agricultural sustainability with time in real sense. It would be primarily based on management of interactions indirectly through identification of integrative variables as surrogate, which may help to achieve internal regulation or self-reliance in agroecosystems. Further, it would be helpful to eliminate the widening socio-economic divide and in mitigation of global change in environment (i.e. air, water and soil) and climate. Additionally, it would improve and restore the multifaceted potential of soil, thus quality and productivity, through improved internal regulation on resource-use efficiency. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Over the past decade we have seen a global increase in interdisciplinary sustainability degrees. These degrees are relatively understudied due to their recent emergence. To better understand the challenges and benefits of this type of coursework and learning experience, we must explore students' perspectives. Rarely explored from the student viewpoint are: (1) highly interdisciplinary instruction that transcends more than four disciplines; (2) the potential effect of students' incoming disciplinary background. This case study seized an opportunity to gain insights and perceptions from students across very diverse backgrounds within a shared interdisciplinary program. We surveyed 61 students enrolled in a highly interdisciplinary degree (Master of Environment and Sustainability; Monash University, Melbourne, Australia) and compared responses of students from STEMM, non-STEMM and mixed incoming degrees. Students' specific disciplinary backgrounds were diverse, including physical sciences, engineering, marketing, business, fashion, law and education. We used a mixed methods approach to analyze survey data. The dominant perceived benefits of interdisciplinary training reported were: (1) career relevance; (2) expanded knowledge and perspectives of sustainability issues; (3) confidence in envisioning sustainability solutions. The main perceived challenges reported were potential confusion from rapidly upskilling into new domains and disciplinary jargon. Interestingly, respondents in this case study viewed these challenges as an authentic reflection of professional sustainability practice rather than a pedagogical issue. In line with this, students showed a preference for pedagogical approaches that simulated real world scenarios and developed career skills. Disciplinary background did not generally influence students' views. All students identified similar challenges, benefits and pedagogical preferences, with one difference. Students from mixed prior degrees and non-STEMM disciplines showed a possible trend towards valuing cross-disciplinary teamwork more than those from STEMM backgrounds. Overall, our findings suggest that the diverse student cohort within the highly interdisciplinary sustainability program of this case study generally viewed this mode of education as beneficial, career-relevant and accessible. This case study may additionally encourage interdisciplinary educators from other fields, such as health professions, to also include more diverse domains and student cohorts in their programs.

AB  - Background In Malaysia, the Geriatric Oral Health Assessment Index (GOHAI) has been recognized as a vital instrument for evaluating oral health-related quality of life among the elderly population. Its integration into the National Health and Morbidity Survey (NHMS) in 2018 demonstrates the country's dedication to understanding and addressing the unique oral health challenges faced by older individuals. The NHMS, led by the Ministry of Health Malaysia, serves as a crucial platform for identifying and addressing healthcare needs, while also working towards achieving sustainable development goals. This study aimed to provide valuable information for stakeholders and researchers by investigating the relationship between quality of life related to oral health and demographic factors, with the ultimate goal of enhancing oral healthcare for older individuals. Objective The objective of this research was to identify the variables that impact the Oral Health-Related Quality of Life (OHRQoL) of non-institutionalized elderly individuals who visit the Klinik Pergigian Manipal University College Malaysia (MUCM). By utilizing the OHRQoL, dental practitioners can gain insight into the elderly's oral health-related quality of life, which is crucial information for dental healthcare providers to effectively reach out to and cater to the elderly at the institution. Methodology A cross-sectional design was employed, utilizing a non-probability sampling method to select eligible elderly individuals at the clinic. A validated questionnaire comprising 18 items covering sociodemographic details and the Geriatric Oral Health Assessment Index (GOHAI) was distributed to individuals above 60 years via printed forms. One way ANOVA, unpaired t -test and multiple linear regression analysis were performed to analyze the data. Results The overall mean GOHAI score among non-institutionalized elderly attending Klinik Pergigian MUCM was 48.38 +/- 9.33, indicating poor OHRQoL. The psychosocial impact domain had a mean score of 19.33 +/- 5.21, surpassing the pain and discomfort domain with a score of 10.73 +/- 2.82, highlighting the significant impact of psychosocial factors on poor oral health-related quality of life. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed no significant associations between OHRQoL and factors such as ethnicity, living arrangements apart from spouse and family, or tertiary education among older individuals after adjusting for confounding variables. Conclusions This study indicates that sociodemographic aspects have minimal impact on the OHRQoL of seniors. Further examination is needed to understand the economic aspects of tooth replacement options and preventive measures in this age group. To enhance the OHRQoL of older adults, especially those not living in facilities like nursing homes or assisted living centers, tailored oral healthcare plans and strategies are crucial. Interdisciplinary collaboration among mental health professionals, geriatric experts, and oral healthcare providers is crucial for empowering both healthcare practitioners and seniors to maintain optimal oral health.

AB  - Symbolic narratives, such as an "ivory tower", a "grey zone", or a "black box" tell us about the gap between university and society, and academia and industry. Recently, they have been replaced by the Quadruple Helix model, which closes the gap by connecting four main stakeholders-government, university, industry, and society, into an innovation ecosystem. However, the roles of the different stakeholders are often blurred and difficult to define, and it is difficult to develop a basic approach to implement responsible innovations in industrial ecosystems in general. On the other hand, the interactions between stakeholder groups, especially universities and industry, are not sufficiently demonstrated in both scientific literature and empirical studies. We note that the responsible research and innovation (RRI) approach should facilitate a framework of shared taxonomy among stakeholders. By highlighting this situation, we follow the paradigm of emerging thinking and we seek to fill this knowledge gap theoretically and empirically. Therefore, in this study, we combined several strategies and perspectives. First, we conducted survey research concerning social capital in Poland and Lithuania to understand the impact of social capital and trust on stakeholder cooperation. Second, we conducted interviews with scientists who actively work to transfer knowledge into industry. Third, we utilized field notes from working experiences in research management. This work has theoretical and practical implications. The theoretical contribution of the paper demonstrates the construction of methodology based on emerging perspectives, and new theoretical insights, on professional discourses for implementing the responsible innovation approach in industrial ecosystems, by highlighting the commitments of main stakeholder groups. Practical input: our insights and empirical research will contribute toward sustainability policymaking and achieving substantial results in industrial ecosystems. The results indicate that if there is trust, then the government, companies, and society (in Poland and Lithuania) would be willing to cooperate with each other. However, there is a lack of trust and cooperation between universities and businesses. Stakeholders have become increasingly aware of the emergence of a science and industry cooperation as an open platform, enlarged with society and policies. They note the problem of making research public and transparent as part of a new mode of cooperation; however, they articulate RRI as a framework of shared taxonomy.

AB  - Dry rivers are non-perennial rivers with no surface water in their channels except after heavy rainfall or snowmelt. The lack of water flow is often associated with a low provision of Nature's Contributions to People (NCP) and a poor quality of life. However, recent review studies have found evidence of human communities thriving in dry rivers through the co-production of multiple NCP, although no case studies have yet confirmed this evidence. We assessed the capacity of dry rivers and their associated social systems to provide NCP. We selected three dry rivers with high natural, cultural and landscape values in the most arid part of Murcia (Spain). We interviewed 37 representatives of the most influential social groups in the study area to explore the NCP of dry rivers, their synergies and trade-offs. Four material, three non-material and eight regulating NCP were identified, as well as one unique NCP: access to villages and fields through dry riverbeds. Fifty-two synergies were identified, especially between material and non-material NCP, and eight trade-offs. This wide range of NCP and synergies is a consequence of the co-production processes between dry rivers and the social system. NCP co-production seems to be underpinned by the indigenous and local knowledge acquired by the social system over generations about the management of floodwaters, biodiversity and geodiversity. Incorporating this knowledge into research and governance can help raise awareness of the NCP provided by dry rivers and help develop strategies for mitigating and adapting to global change.
   Dry rivers provide benefits that contribute to people's quality of life. These benefits are co-produced by dry rivers and their associated social systems. The co-production of benefits depends on the traditional knowledge that social systems have acquired over generations.The co-production of benefits between dry rivers and their social systems is a sustainable reference model, providing food, freshwater, medicines, building materials, natural habitats, soil protection, scientific advances, recreation and cultural identity.Benefit co-production and traditional knowledge from dry rivers not only contribute to people's quality of life, but are also a source of strategies for coping with global change, particularly climate change in drylands.Society seems to be unaware of the high value of dry rivers for our quality of life. Integrating benefit co-production and traditional knowledge into governance is essential to revalue these ecosystems and develop effective management policies.

AB  - BackgroundTo achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030, Thailand must engage in effective multi-sectoral collaboration (MSC). However, implementing MSC in Thailand presents significant challenges. Although Thailand had a 2011-2020 MSC strategic plan for the control of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) with the prime minister taking the lead, joined by many non-health ministers, not a single meeting was called over those 10 years. This paper describes the development of a new tool created to enhance MSC between health and non-health sectors in controlling NCDs in Thailand. Stakeholder-engaged research will be used to implement and evaluate this tool. This paper also describes the research planned to test the new approach.MethodsThe authors used two main methods: (1) a narrative review on MSC enhancement and (2) a series of four consultation meetings with key stakeholders - in the health, non-health and academic sectors - to develop a research study to implement and evaluate the new approach.ResultsTo address previous MSC implementation problems, the proposed novel MSC enhancement approach emphasizes three principles: (1) pursuit of committed-stakeholder involvement at the middle-management level, instead of relying on the top-management level, an approach which has never been successful; (2) production of knowledge to support specific, achievable target policies; and (3) use of a comprehensive set of knowledge-translation activities and knowledge brokers to solve the problem of ineffective routine official communications between members of the MSC. Using participatory consultations during the research proposal development, middle-level officials from three non-health ministries (the Ministries of Agriculture, Finance and Education) agreed to join the MSC to work together to solve specific problems regarding the control of NCDs. A target-advocated policy for each ministry was formulated and agreed upon by both non-health-sector and health-sector stakeholders.ConclusionsThis new approach (middle-management oriented), if implemented, may encourage more commitment from the Ministries' representatives, policy-relevant knowledge generation and effective communications between ministries involved in an MSC. Ideally, it would complement the conventional approach (top-management oriented) in enhancing the MSC for controlling NCDs, and thereby bring hope for achieving the NCD-related SDGs for Thailand and possibly other countries as well.

AB  - Creating "green" organo-mineral fertilizers with a porous structure requires a systematic approach to the development of granules composition, method of agglomeration and determination of the optimal technological parameters for implementing the process. The samples of encapsulated organo-mineral fertilizers were obtained in a laboratory setup based on a pangranulator. Six types of fertilizer samples based on urea in a phosphate shell with various types of plasticizers and additional components were proposed. The influence of the organic modifier and plasticizer composition on the nanopores characteristics of phosphate-containing shell was investigated. The study of the phosphate-containing shell structure showed that location and structure of the nanopores and micropores depends on the type of plasticizer and the addition of components such as "Avatar" and biochar. The obtained boundary layers also have nanopores to ensure gradual moisture penetration to the core during the prolonged diffusion of nutritional elements from the N-containing part of the core and slow dissolution of the organic shell. According to the results of the structural analysis of the coatings, it was determined that the most successful is the composition with the addition of biochar and the use of calcium humate as a plasticizer, which makes it possible to create a nanoporous organo-mineral shell. The results of such work will be the base for optimization of the apparatus construction calculation as a part of technological scheme based on pan-granulator. The novelty and effectiveness of this technical solution has been confirmed during vegetative agrochemical tests. The eco-constructive impact of new types of fertilizers on the environment was estimated. The proposed novel composition of fertilizers with biochar-phosphate shell in the series of agrochemical vegetative tests showed the largest increase in yield, improves their quality and increased the humus content in the soil. The necessity of technological transformational changes in the industry and agriculture, based on the concept of innovative green proactivity, has been substantiated to accelerate the green transition and achieve sustainable development goals. The compliance of new types of fertilizers with the stakeholders' needs (producer, consumer, state and society) has been estimated, which showed the full relevance of the green innovation to all market actors, the high potential of the marketing need, and the high expected level of its acceptance by the market. Hence, it has been concluded, that given market feasibility, further implementation of an ecologically oriented innovative business project aimed at obtaining "green" encapsulated fertilizer with a nanoporous structure should be kept on carrying out.

   Design/methodology/approach In an effort to understand student outcomes provided by the SH, an in-depth literature review on practical learning environments and interview methods were applied. The following open-ended questions were asked in an effort to gather and consolidate student experiences with the SH. What are your experiences in/with SH? Please tell us briefly about your experiences. The language has been adjusted and interviewers answered questions and made clarifications if asked to. Master's in international sustainable tourism (MIST) program students were selected for this study. Participants' responses were recorded using the computer-assisted personal interviewing technique.
   Findings The most important characteristic students recognized about the SH is that it provided us a safe place to fail. One student described SH as [...] a safe space where students can gain experiences of learning new processes firsthand without external pressures (e.g., on-the-job training, eventuation, and financial analysis). The safety attribute of the SH environment is considered as a comfortable place to learn from other classmates or visitors (mostly volunteers and interns). It is a real hospitality and tourism business-learning center, which is a great benefit to the students not only because of its environment but also because of the diversity among student's educational and professional backgrounds.
   Research limitations/implications The primary limitations of this study need to be addressed. The number of interviews was very limited with one year data which could affect the generalizability of this study. In addition, it was not clearly explained to the student what rubrics and standardized metrics were used during interview process; after interview, students were asked to provide a better way to improve the research outcomes. For further studies, it is strongly recommended to provide the direction to make sure it applies to the conditions that are prevalent in the existing site to be examined.
   Practical implications Both strategies that link the SH to this MIST program have significant merit. Students implementing best practices in the courses have clearly identified the challenges of implementation, but all agree that there is tremendous value in the experiences they have received during their studies. Furthermore, using the SH as an engagement tool has motivated students to consciously interactive and collaborative in a more proactive manner.
   Originality/value This unique experience and operational competency at the SH provides participants with an in-depth understanding of the context and challenges of sustainability but needs to be detailed and promoted more in the future. The SH is facilitating a learning environment among not only students but also faculty and staff. The results clearly indicated that the SH has influenced sustainable behaviors by promoting interactive engagement.

AB  - Background Smallholding plantations represent approximately 40% of the total palm oil plantation area globally. For any certifications, standards, and other instruments to achieve more ethical and sustainable palm oil supply chains, it is essential to improve smallholder engagement in the schemes. A large body of research has built up our understanding of the challenges of engaging smallholders in sustainability initiatives in various sites and countries. A broad systematic understanding of how different types of sustainability initiatives can support or restrict smallholders from access to market and different resources and under which economic and social conditions are not yet developed. This systematic map aims to identify, map, and describe the body of evidence that exists on the positive and negative impacts of sustainability initiatives on smallholder engagement in palm oil practices in Southeast Asia. The findings are expected to inform policies and practices on smallholder engagement in sustainable palm oil supply chains and identify evidence gaps where future primary studies and evidence syntheses can contribute.
   Methods We will develop a guiding framework of interventions through other works on supply chain instruments. We will then construct a test library of 39 items through field expert consultations and snowballing using literature search algorithms. The search will cover four publication databases, five bibliographic databases, and 13 topical and organizational websites. We will search for existing evidence syntheses and primary research studies in Southeast Asia countries published between 2008 and 2021. This systematic map will only include English language articles due to our limited capacity. We will screen the search results at the title/abstract and the full-text levels. Numbers of included/excluded items and reasons for exclusion will be noted and visualized via a ROSES flow diagram. We will develop a data extraction form for assessing data useful for reporting current trends of smallholder engagement in sustainable palm oil initiatives. A random sample of 20% of the included articles will be assessed for validity using Joanne Briggs Institute's critical appraisal checklist. We will then organize and summarize the data according to the defined PICO.

AB  - In recent years, wood has received increased interest in Europe as a multi-storey building material. The trend is driven by the recognition that wood, as an environment friendly material, can contribute bioeconomy development and the achievement of sustainable development goals. In Lithuania, multi-storey wood-based building is still at the level of policy and political discussions. Therefore, the presented research focuses on quantification and comparison of the sustainability impacts of both wood- and concrete-based building materials value chains and provides applied scientific knowledge relevant to decision makers and in this way contributes to mitigation of the climate change.
   In detail, study covers the production value chain - from raw material extraction to manufacturing using the same method, while documenting and assessing the material sourcing stages transparently and consistently. In our study glue laminated timber and sawn timber building materials represented renewable material value chains, while site-cast concrete and precast reinforced concrete building materials represented non-renewable materials value chains. In discussion with study partners in the BenchValue project and during a project stakeholder workshop, twelve environmental, social and economic indicators were selected to perform the sustainability impact assessment of selected building materials. Building materials were compared by using a decision support tool ToSIA. The relevant data was gathered from local, well-known companies in the national and international arena.
   Our results revealed that glue laminated timber and sawn timber value chains compared to site-cast concrete and precast reinforced concrete value chains have more positive sustainability impacts. This is especially true when analysing environmental indicators: GHG emissions, Energy use, Generation of wastes and Water use. Analyses also revealed more positive socio-economic impacts of wood-based building materials. The socio-economic advantage of wood could increase competitiveness of the regions and contributes to their sustainable development.
   Our paper is in line with the applied research. Since it is a case study, the presented results are country specific, because the estimation of indicators was done by applying local data. The presented research is relevant to policy experts and decision makers in the context of the reduction of CO2 emissions. Also, this paper is relevant to the companies and architects who want to build and compare various building materials. Partially, results of this paper could be applied in other countries with comparable to Lithuania economic development level, having in mind the possible shortcomings already highlighted.

AB  - The capability of rural community governance is significantly impacted by the different types of land ownership when capital investment in rural tourism to achieve rural revitalisation. The outcomes of which profoundly affect sustainable rural development. This study, by utilising a theoretical framework using double movement theory, aims to assess the impacts on rural community governance by two different land ownership models, the Enterprise-based Model (EBM) and the Community-based Model (CBM), in the process of capital flow to the countryside (CFC). Case studies of the two villages were adopted to examine and explore the logic of interaction between stakeholders and reveal the internal mechanism of rural community governance. The results of this research indicate that the CBM has considerable advantages over the EBM. In the CBM, the village collective retains land ownership without fully marketising, which allows villagers to maintain their bargaining power with investors whilst increasing their local awareness. In the EBM, however, the local government promotes the conversion of land ownership. The villagers benefit more from one-time acquisition but lose sustainable benefits created by local development. Stakeholders call for the need to create a development model beyond the market economy by maintaining China's rural land system in the process of CFC. In this regard, this paper provides an original contribution.
   La capacidad de gobernanza de la comunidad rural se ve significativamente impactada por los diferentes tipos de propiedad de la tierra cuando se invierte capital en turismo rural para lograr la revitalizaci & oacute;n rural. Los resultados afectan profundamente el desarrollo rural sostenible. Este estudio, utilizando un marco te & oacute;rico basado en la teor & iacute;a del doble movimiento, tiene como objetivo evaluar los impactos en la gobernanza de la comunidad rural de dos diferentes modelos de propiedad de la tierra, el Modelo Basado en la Empresa (en ingl & eacute;s, "Enterprise-based Model", EBM) y el Modelo Basado en la Comunidad (en ingl & eacute;s, "Community-based Model", CBM), en el proceso de flujo de capital hacia el campo (en ingl & eacute;s, "Capital Flow to the Countryside", CFC). Se adoptaron estudios de caso de dos aldeas para examinar y explorar la l & oacute;gica de interacci & oacute;n entre los interesados y revelar el mecanismo interno de gobernanza de la comunidad rural. Los resultados de esta investigaci & oacute;n indican que el CBM tiene considerables ventajas sobre el EBM. En el CBM, el colectivo del pueblo retiene la propiedad de la tierra sin comercializarla completamente, lo que permite a los aldeanos mantener su poder de negociaci & oacute;n con los inversores mientras aumentan su conciencia local. En el EBM, sin embargo, el gobierno local promueve la conversi & oacute;n de la propiedad de la tierra. Los aldeanos se benefician m & aacute;s de una adquisici & oacute;n & uacute;nica pero pierden los beneficios sostenibles creados por el desarrollo local. Los interesados piden la necesidad de crear un modelo de desarrollo m & aacute;s all & aacute; de la econom & iacute;a de mercado manteniendo el sistema de tierras rurales de China en el proceso de CFC. En este sentido, este documento proporciona una contribuci & oacute;n original.

AB  - Introduction: Globally, the healthcare sector is primarily designated to provide timely, efficient and effective medical services. In African countries like Nigeria, the inequality in the healthcare sector is worsened by the limited coverage of healthcare delivery. This has evolved to an unprecedented effect on the provision of healthcare services in low-resource societies. In the post COVID-19 era, recovery and growth from the pandemic become more demanding with an emphasis on promoting innovative technology in the healthcare sector on hygiene and safe medication practices.Method: Data was sourced from mixed research method. Questionnaires, focus group discussions, and in-depth interviews were used to deduce data from 142 healthcare providers, users, and social workers. Participants were randomly selected from three healthcare institutions in Nsukka, Enugu state.Result: Findings revealed that although greater positive perception (66.7%) holds on promoting innovative technology in the healthcare sector; concerns on negative perceptions (33.3%) were; the choice of medication, cultural health behavior and non-adherence to health guidelines. Major factors militating against innovative technology in healthcare sector were corruption in healthcare system, patients' economic level and poor healthcare delivery. Findings depict that age ( chi 2cal = 84.0, p = 0.0 0 0 < 0.05) and income ( chi 2cal = 53.7, p = 0.0 0 0 < 0.05) of patients were found to be significant in the utilization of innovative technology in healthcare. Evidence-based interventions on innovative healthcare systems on hygiene and safe medication practices were; intensive community health education at the grass-root, implementation of health policies, and tutors' improved healthcare knowledge. Participants showed little knowledge of social workers' engagement in health institutions.Conclusion: Equity in healthcare is a core concern in Sustainable Development Goals. Achieving equal distribution of health services between urban and rural societies in recovery from covid-19 pandemic and growth of the healthcare sector is pegged on promoting innovative technology in hygiene and safe medication practices. The study recommends that social workers' engagement with health providers and users in low-resourced societies could help propagate awareness and self-care management of health challenges through digital information technology in Nigeria.(c) 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - CONTEXT: Sustainably improving food production to meet the needs of a growing population necessitates a dual- pronged approach involving both top-down policy support from governments and grassroots support from social organizations. The combination of these two elements can yield comprehensive and systematic solutions for sustainable crop production, particularly in smallholder-dominated agriculture. However, integrating these approaches to empower smallholders with advanced agricultural technologies and enhance crop sustainability remains a subject that warrants further investigation. OBJECTIVES: We explored collaborative practices for the integration of resources using a dual-pronged approach to empower smallholders for sustainable crop production. METHODS: The DPSIR framework was applied to our case study. Using stratified and random sampling, 258 farmers were recruited from Quzhou, China. We divided the participants into three groups: six farmers who had worked with China-founded Science and Technology backyards (STBs) for 15 years as leading farmers (LF), 90 neighboring farmers (NF) who were closely related to LF, and 162 traditional farmers (TF) from three villages in Quzhou who were not related to STBs. An intervention experiment focusing on the LF and NF was conducted. Interviews were conducted with 258 farmers after harvesting wheat. In addition, we used statistical analyses to examine the differences in yield and economic and environmental benefits among the different groups. Multiple linear regression was used to determine how different factors affected wheat yield, net profit, and technology adoption. We used a mediation model to analyze the mechanisms by which enabling environmental creation affects sustainable production by empowering farmers. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Compared to TF, LF and NF increased social value by 31% and 25%, technology trust by 16% and 5%, and willingness to accept green production technologies and adoption behavior by 20% and 21%, respectively. In addition, LF and NF achieved wheat yield increases accompanied by net profit gains of 86% and 13%, respectively, and LF demonstrated 53% and 52% reductions in nitrogen surplus compared to TF and NF, respectively. The study found that the synergy of social organizations and government support promoted farmers' knowledge generation and sustainable agricultural production by increasing their social value and technology trust. SIGNIFICANCE: This study underscores the pivotal role of STBs in bridging these two approaches and facilitating an environment that empowers smallholders for sustainable crop production. This study provides initial insights into a multi-actor, co-participation-based approach to promoting farmers' capacity, which provides important information for future agricultural policy development and implementation.

AB  - Urban areas are expanding due to rural-urban migration and due to population increases. Their resilience is being challenged due to socio-political consequences of increasingly frequent and severe storms, due to climate changes, influx of human and animal refugees and as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. The authors prepared a systematic literature of ways cities can be transformed into more resilient, and sustainable regions by creatively enhancing the quality and quantity of blue and green areas in and around them. The literature review was conducted to provide holistic insights into selection, implementation monitoring, assessment, and valuation of Nature-based Solutions in diverse urban regions. The authors reviewed no fewer than 298 articles from 109 academic journals and related sources, published within 1997-2020. The focus of the articles was upon 'nature-based' changes that are being implemented in urban areas, globally to enhance their resilience and the 'quality-of-life' of humans and other species. By implementing nature-based solutions, and complimentary 'urban wilding' approaches, urban areas and their hinterlands are expanding their 'blue' and 'green' areas and are thereby decreasing the 'heat-island' effects, while improving human health by surrounding them with rich bio-diversities of locally adapted, aquatic and terrestrial plants and animals. Although, many NBS options have been documented to be beneficial, their environmental, economic and social/psychological dimensions have not been adequately quantified, especially in the context of climate changes, and with regard to COVID-19. It is essential that the benefits of NBS are quantified with easily measurable outcomes, that are readily understood by practitioners, city policy-makers and members of community organizations, based upon specific geographical and climatological contexts. This will help them accelerate implementation of NBS and wilding into their urban systems. The reviewers found that more research is needed on anticipatory learning, backcasting and community participation to help to effectively implement the appropriate NBS for improving the sustainability of urban systems. The reviewers provide guidance for urban leaders to incorporate NBS into their policies and strategies to improve urban resilience and equity and to more effectively reduce impacts of climate change, population growth and pandemics.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of the study is to assess the environmental and socio-economic impacts and risks of climate change through GIS database management system (DBMS) on land use-informatics and climate-informatics. The Dabka watershed constitutes a part of the Kosi Basin in the Lesser Himalaya, India in district Nainital has been selected for the case illustration.
   Design/methodology/approach - Land use-informatics consists of land use mapping and change diction, i.e. decadal changes and annual changes. Climate-informatics consists of climate change detection through daily, monthly and annual weather data for a period of 25 years.
   Findings - The exercise revealed that oak and pine forests have decreased, respectively, by 25 percent (4.48 km(2)) and 3 percent (0.28 km(2)) thus bringing a decline of 4.76 km(2) forest in the watershed during 1990 to 2010. But, due to climate change the mixed forest taking place of oak forest in certain pockets and consequently the mixed forest in the catchment increased by 18 percent (2.3 km(2)) during the same period which reduced the overall loss of forests in the region but its not eco-friendly as the oak forest. Barren land increased 1.21 km(2) (56 percent), riverbed increased 0.78 km(2) (52 percent) and cultivated land increased about 0.63 km(2) (3 percent) during the period of 1990 to 2010. Out of the total seven classes of the land use land cover, five classes (i.e. Oak, Pine, Mixed, Barren and Riverbed) are being changed dominantly due to climate change factor and anthropogenic factors plays a supporting role whereas only two classes (scrub land and agricultural land) are being changed dominantly by anthropogenic factors and climate change factors plays a supporting role. Expansion of mixed forest land brought out due to upslope shifting of existing forest species due to climate change factor only because upslope areas getting warmer than past with the rate of 9 degrees C-12 degrees C/two decades. Consequently, the results concluded that the high rate of land use change accelerating several environmental problems such as high runoff, flash flood, river-line flood and soil erosion during monsoon season and drought during non-monsoon period. These environmental problems cause great loss to life and property and poses serious threat to the process of development with have far-reaching economic and social consequences.
   Originality/value - This study generated primary data on land use-informatics and climate-informatics to integrate each-other for impact assessment and mitigation through sustainable land use as constitutes a part of a multidisciplinary project, Department of Science and Technology (D.S.T.)

AB  - Purpose Given the increasing relevance of Responsible Management Education (RME) to social and human welfare around the world, this paper aims to present an integrated framework that captures the essence of the principles of RME as defined by the United Nations (UN) and further set forth and embedded in the core principles of the accrediting body of business schools, namely, the American Association of Colleges and Schools of Business (AACSB). Such a framework serves as a rigorous platform for business schools and key stakeholders to integrate and implement core RME principles to deliver long-term sustainable benefits to the communities in which they operate Design/methodology/approach This is a conceptual paper. The authors first define key terms of RME used in the UN and AACSB guidelines to provide a universal language for business schools to communicate with their stakeholders and to monitor RME initiatives. Next, the authors identify and map RME Principles and Standards common to both organizations that business schools can apply and integrate into their educational practices to create societal impact. Finally, they categorize the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the UN into four core purposes and articulate the benefits of clear and consistent messaging that aligns with the vision and mission of the institution Findings The integrated framework presented here makes a unique contribution to business schools that are in the early stages of RME implementation in the following ways: It simplifies the complexity and challenges of integrating the complex RME principles outlined by the UN and the spirit of the RME principles embedded in the accreditation guidelines of AACSB; the four unique themes that emerged from our research provide business schools with a clear pathway to assess their RME progress; and the framework addresses how RME can deliver exceptional value to various stakeholders of business schools. Research limitations/implications There are many opportunities for future researchers to expand on our work particularly, in the areas of RME-driven curriculum development and experiential learning, embedding ethics within high-impact RME practices and developing rigorous metrics to define and measure societal impact. Future researchers may also wish to expand and refine the definitions of key terms and explore the role of societal interaction as an indicator of meaningful institutional engagement with the business community. Practical implications Business educators can use this framework that maps AACBS core RME themes to the RME guidelines of the UN to assess, establish and enhance their strategies to implement and improve RME-driven business education. Originality/value This integrated framework makes a unique contribution to business schools by simplifying the complexity and challenges of implementing RME principles outlined by the UN and that of AACSB. By integrating the principles outlined by both the accrediting body of business schools with the ideals of the U.N in a simple and elegant framework, business schools can embrace and embark on implementing one or more of the four core RME themes identified in this paper. Implementation of these principles within a core RME theme has the potential to create a strong and unique global leadership position for a business school and its graduates.

AB  - Purpose - Mosques in Africa face challenges associated with facilities management (FM), as newly built mosques deteriorate rapidly because of the absence of facilities managers who can implement preventive measures and maintain them in suitable conditions. The purpose of this paper is to explore existing literature to justify the need for employing professional facilities managers in managing mosque operations in Ghana. Design/methodology/approach - This viewpoint adopts a five-stage comprehensive methodology to study FM in mosque operations, linking it with practical observations and comparative analysis. The methodology includes an extensive literature review of previous studies and reports, a walkthrough scope analysis of industry standards and walkthrough inspections of some mosques in Kumasi and Accra, comparative content analysis integrating literature with practical observations, field observations and informal engagements with MMCs Chairpersons, along with the synthesis and evaluation of the findings. Findings - This study reveals that mosque management committees (MMCs) excel in community engagement and religious sensitivity but struggle with maintenance, strategic planning and operational efficiency because of a lack of formal training and technical expertise. Professional facilities managers (PFMs) bring specialised skills in infrastructure management, sustainability and asset management, addressing these gaps and improving overall operational performance. Integrating advanced technologies such as Building Information Modelling and Mobile Apps further enhance mosque operations. Bridging the gap between MMCs and professional FMs is crucial for optimising mosque functionality, resource utilisation and long-term sustainability. Practical implications - The viewpoint recommends a hybrid management model combining MMCs' community engagement with PFMs' expertise. Capacity-building programs for MMC members and structured frameworks for financial management and maintenance scheduling are essential for sustainable mosque operations. Originality/value - Being a pioneer study to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of traditional MMCs and professional FM practices in maintaining and enhancing mosque operations, this study bridges the knowledge gap by incorporating best practices from professional bodies such as the International Facility Management Association (IFMA), the Institute of Workplace and Facilities Management and the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. These organisations provide guidelines on maintenance planning, sustainability and operational efficiency, directly applicable to mosque FM practices that can be adopted in Ghanaian mosques through case studies.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this study is to explore the role of direct public engagement in shaping the sustainability image of nuclear energy in the UAE and the Arabian Gulf region. The study aims to measure the conflicting viewpoints of stakeholders, particularly the local community, regarding nuclear energy's dependability, cost-effectiveness, safety and environmental friendliness. The study also seeks to assess the effectiveness of direct stakeholder engagement strategies in enhancing public confidence in nuclear energy as a safe and sustainable source of electricity.Design/methodology/approach - This study uses a quantitative-methods research design and used a sample of 318 participants. The SPSS AMOS application was used to conduct a structural equation model analysis. The purpose of this analysis is to examine the relationships among variables that constitute the key constructs of the study. In addition, confirmatory factor analysis was used to assess the reliability of the testing approach. Various fit indices and measurements, such as chi-square ratio, degrees of freedom, GFI, CFI and RMSEA, were used to evaluate the adequacy of the model.Findings - The study finds that the construct "Direct Stakeholder Engagement (DSE)" has a positive effect on the dependent variables "Trust in Nuclear Sustainability (TNS)" and "Perception of Nuclear Energy as Safe (PNE)" with a probability value of (0.003, p < 0.05). Therefore, the hypothesis of the study is deemed acceptable. Hence, it can be concluded that each of the foregoing variables (DSE1, 2, 3, 4 and 5) and (TNS1, 2, 3, 4 and 5) with (PNE1, 2 and 3) have been observed and analysed in this study, and based on this analysis, it is plausible that the public's trust in nuclear sustainability and their acceptance of nuclear energy as a safe source of their nation's electricity can be positively affected by direct stakeholder engagement.Practical implications - The study's findings have implications for policymakers and managers of nuclear power plants in the UAE and the Arabian Gulf region. The study provides insights into effective stakeholder engagement strategies that can enhance public participation and confidence in nuclear energy. The study's recommendations highlight the importance of incorporating public opinion in policymaking and management practices to address conflicting viewpoints and enhance public trust in nuclear sustainability. The study's findings also contribute to the ongoing discourse on nuclear sustainability and provide insights into the role of direct public engagement in shaping public perception of nuclear energy.Originality/value - This study's originality lies in its focus on the UAE and the Arabian Gulf region, where nuclear energy is a critical source of electricity. The study contributes to the limited research on stakeholder engagement and public perception of nuclear energy in the region. The study's novel framework of stakeholder engagement, tailored to cultural dimensions, provides insights into effective engagement strategies that can enhance public participation and confidence in nuclear energy. The study's quantitative-methods research design also provides a comprehensive understanding of the conflicting viewpoints of stakeholders, enhancing the understanding of the role of direct public engagement in shaping public perception of nuclear energy.

AB  - Blockchain-a digitally distributed, decentralised, peer-to-peer shared ledger technology that exists across a delimited network-is recognised as a disruptive technology for the next socioeconomic mega trend. Most of the researchers in education theoretically speculate upon blockchain's extraordinary potentials for enterprises, finance, administration, and management of education. Little attention has been paid, however, to the problems of socially inclusive knowledge transformation, sustainability, and equitable access to quality education for marginalised communities. This paper aims to describe an approach and method for leveraging education blockchain as a possible means to advance the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for the social inclusion of marginalised communities of teachers and learners. This theoretical paper adopts a reflective research approach to critically analyse the current state of blockchain applications in education, and discuss its prospects for building educational commons for sustainable development. This paper contributes to the field of educational technology by exploring blockchain's prospects to building educational commons through four strategies: (a) network cooperation; (b) diversity of interacting agents; (c) shared resources; and (d) educational logistics. It also contributes to the conceptualisation of knowledge transformation for sustainable education by modelling blockchain-supported educational commons and informing educational practitioners and technological innovation policy makers. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Blockchain is a digitally distributed, decentralised, peer-to-peer shared ledger technology that can be adopted across education networks. Blockchain is regarded as a disruptive technology and a key driver of the next socioeconomic mega trend. The extant literature on blockchain in education are technology-centred and limited to applications in financing, administration, and management of education. Blockchain's potential to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in education and in favour of marginalised communities remain unexplored. What this paper adds A critique of the mainstream literature and its utilitarian and business-oriented paradigm for leveraging blockchain technology in education. An operational definition of 'education blockchain' as a set of affordances of a blockchain technology that empowers educators and learners to achieve sustainability of their education system. Conceptualisation of a 'sustainable education blockchain' for the knowledge transformation of marginalised communities. A framework of blockchain for building educational commons through network cooperation, diversity of interactive agents, shared resources and educational logistics. Implications for practice and/or policy This paper calls for re-orienting blockchain technology in education from pro-profit to human-centred adoption. This is to ensure a balance among technological advances, knowledge transformation, and safeguarding of privacy and individual rights of marginalised teachers and learners. Sustainable blockchain technology is for the social inclusion of marginalised teachers and learners by means of secure and trusted peer-to-peer collaboration, autonomous community organisation and fair distribution of resources.
   This paper contributes to the conceptualisation of knowledge transformation for sustainable education by (a) modelling the key features of blockchain-supported educational commons; and (b) informing educational practitioners and innovation policy makers who are interested in blockchain applications. The model contributes to the understanding of an authentic and humanistic knowledge transformation beyond its dominant notion of an instrumental, linear, purely technological driver of educational systems. The model allows us to envisage a more sustainable transformation in educational practices.

AB  - PurposeThe paper tests if and to what extent lean management system adoption generates abnormal profitability, and how it accrues over time. Configurational approaches to lean management systems and "S-curve" effects in lean implementation are used to ground the paper's hypotheses and interpret its findings.Design/methodology/approachUsing the emerging view of lean as enterprise-wide management systems, this quasi-experimental study uses a difference-in-differences approach to estimate the abnormal profitability (ROIC) attributable to lean management system adoption. The paper leverages a unique data set of lean adopters nested in a panel data set (19 years) of 2,088 industrial firms matched by industry and firm size. It applies a variety of regression methods (two-way fixed effect panel estimator, propensity score matching, instrumental variable two-stage-least squares) to estimate the size of the abnormal profitability attributable to lean management systems, addressing endogeneity issues related to non-random sampling, omitted variable bias and reverse causation. It also analyzes the cross-firm variability of such abnormal profitability and how it accrues over time.FindingsFor the average non-adopter in the sample (44.3 million euro revenues), lean adoption generates abnormal ROIC ranging from 1.4% to 3.9%. These results come into effect approximately three years after starting lean adoption and peak after eight years. While the average abnormal profitability attributable to lean adoption is sizable, it varies significantly across firms and over time. This significant variation is compatible with firms' diverse ability to understand the complex inner workings of lean systems, and to design and implement them so that they improve profitability.Research limitations/implicationsThe conceptualization of lean as enterprise-wide management system can be further refined to more effectively categorize the components of lean systems and investigate the nature of their relationships. Lean system adoption measurement can be fine-tuned to better capture cross-firm and longitudinal heterogeneity. Future work can explore other dependent variables of interest to different stakeholders including shareholders' value, employment and environmental and social sustainability.Practical implicationsThe financial benefits of adopting lean can be reaped to the extent to which managers embrace lean as a philosophy and implement it pervasively in the organization. A firm can use the study's estimates as a basis for making calculations about the returns of investment in lean adoption. The paper also shows that "getting the lean system right" makes a significant difference in terms of abnormal profitability, which is twice as large for the best lean adopters..Social implicationsCompared with the promises of many lean proponents and supporters, the paper provides a more realistic view of what to expect from lean adoption in terms of profitability. Adopting lean as a comprehensive, enterprise-wide management system is not a universal panacea, but a complex endeavor, characterized by multiple complex decisions that require considerable capabilities, coordinated efforts and consistency of action.Originality/valueDifferently from extant research, this study does not study the correlation between the adoption of lean operation practices and financial performance but focuses on the abnormal profitability generated by the adoption of lean as a pervasive, enterprise-wide management system.
   Its research design allows to identify the differential profitability attributable to lean adoption and documents that it accrues non-linearly.

AB  - This study aims to highlight the degree of perception of the young population (18-35 years old), from the northern region of Oltenia (Gorj County, Romania), regarding the impact of the wave of seismic strong ground motions recorded in the region, starting from 13 February 2023, on some indicators to characterize the sustainable development of the region, in particular, the entrepreneurial potential of the region and the quality of life of the affected population. It was considered opportune to carry out this study, considering the novelty of such a situation, as the respective geographical area has not been subjected to strong ground motions in the recent past. This study was built on the basis of the questionnaire applied to 599 people, with permanent residence in Gorj County and aged between 18 and 35 years. The data were collected between 27 February 2023 and 31 March 2023, more than fourteen days after the first recorded micro-seismic event. The main working method is the combined statistical analysis, on the one hand, of the notification and evaluation of the respondents' degree of information regarding the manifestation of the wave of seismic strong ground motions, the perception of the authorities' involvement in the management of its negative effects (material damage and effects on the regional entrepreneurial potential), the negative impact on some indicators for evaluating the sustainable development of the region, and, on the other hand, the engagement in the empirical research of the phenomenon, related to the objectives of sustainable development, in accordance with the bibliography available. This study reveals that, in the context of a very high degree of information of the respondents regarding the manifestation of the wave of seismic strong ground motions (about 95%) and the reasonable degree of access to resources and credible information materials (55.2%), only 45.4% of them expressed their high confidence in the action of the authorities to limit the negative effects of seismic strong ground motions. On the other hand, this study highlights that the highest satisfaction average of the population, among the four WHOQOL-BREF domains, is represented by the "Psychological" domain (75.33 & PLUSMN; 21.17), and the lowest average is represented by the "Environmental" domain (67.45 & PLUSMN; 20.90). This study also reveals that male respondents show a higher satisfaction average than that recorded in the case of female respondents in the "Physical", Psychological", and "Environmental" domains; for the "Social" domain, the differences are insignificant in favor of the respondents from the second category. The respondents domiciled in the rural environment compared to those domiciled in the urban environment register higher mean scores in all four domains of the quality of life analysis; the respondents with higher education have a higher average score in the "Physical", "Psychological", and "Social" domains, with the exception of the "Environmental" domain. The quality of life indicators for the people in the area affected by earthquakes are adversely influenced by their concerns regarding the potential harm to the region's touristic and entrepreneurial potential. Specifically, those with a high level of belief in the potential harm to the tourism and entrepreneurial potential of the region have lower quality of life measures than those with a low level of belief.
   Additionally, individuals with a high level of trust in the authorities' measures to limit the negative impacts of the earthquakes have better quality of life measures than those with low trust.

AB  - Background
   Labour companionship refers to support provided to a woman during labour and childbirth, and may be provided by a partner, family member, friend, doula or healthcare professional. A Cochrane systematic review of interventions by Bohren and colleagues, concluded that having a labour companion improves outcomes for women and babies. The presence of a labour companion is therefore regarded as an important aspect of improving quality of care during labour and childbirth; however implementation of the intervention is not universal. Implementation of labour companionship may be hampered by limited understanding of factors affecting successful implementation across contexts.
   Objectives
   The objectives of the review were to describe and explore the perceptions and experiences of women, partners, community members, healthcare providers and administrators, and other key stakeholders regarding labour companionship; to identify factors affecting successful implementation and sustainability of labour companionship; and to explore how the findings of this review can enhance understanding of the related Cochrane systematic review of interventions.
   Search methods
   We searched MEDLINE, CINAHL, and POPLINE K4Health databases for eligible studies from inception to 9 September 2018. There were no language, date or geographic restrictions.
   Selection criteria
   We included studies that used qualitative methods for data collection and analysis; focused on women's, partners', family members', doulas', providers', or other relevant stakeholders' perceptions and experiences of labour companionship; and were from any type of health facility in any setting globally.
   Data collection and analysis
   We used a thematic analysis approach for data extraction and synthesis, and assessed the confidence in the findings using the GRADE-CERQual approach. We used two approaches to integrate qualitative findings with the intervention review findings. We used a logic model to theorise links between elements of the intervention and health and well-being outcomes. We also used a matrix model to compare features of labour companionship identified as important in the qualitative evidence synthesis with the interventions included in the intervention review.
   Main results
   We found 51 studies (52 papers), mostly from high-income countries and mostly describing women's perspectives. We assessed our level of confidence in each finding using the GRADE-CERQual approach. We had high or moderate confidence in many of our findings. Where we only had low or very low confidence in a finding, we have indicated this.
   Labour companions supported women in four different ways. Companions gave informational support by providing information about childbirth, bridging communication gaps between health workers and women, and facilitating non-pharmacological pain relief. Companions were advocates, which means they spoke up in support of the woman. Companions provided practical support, including encouraging women to move around, providing massage, and holding her hand. Finally, companions gave emotional support, using praise and reassurance to help women feel in control and confident, and providing a continuous physical presence.
   Women who wanted a companion present during labour and childbirth needed this person to be compassionate and trustworthy. Companionship helped women to have a positive birth experience. Women without a companion could perceive this as a negative birth experience. Women had mixed perspectives about wanting to have a male partner present (low confidence). Generally, men who were labour companions felt that their presence made a positive impact on both themselves (low confidence) and on the relationship with their partner and baby (low confidence), although some felt anxious witnessing labour pain (low confidence). Some male partners felt that they were not well integrated into the care team or decision-making.
   Doulas often met with women before birth to build rapport and manage expectations. Women could develop close bonds with their doulas (low confidence). Foreign-born women in high-income settings may appreciate support from community-based doulas to receive culturally-competent care (low confidence).
   Factors affecting implementation included health workers and women not recognising the benefits of companionship, lack of space and privacy, and fearing increased risk of infection (low confidence). Changing policies to allow companionship and addressing gaps between policy and practice were thought to be important (low confidence). Some providers were resistant to or not well trained on how to use companions, and this could lead to conflict. Lay companions were often not integrated into antenatal care, which may cause frustration (low confidence).
   We compared our findings from this synthesis to the companionship programmes/approaches assessed in Bohren's review of effectiveness.
   We found that most of these programmes did not appear to address these key features of labour companionship.
   Authors' conclusions
   We have high or moderate confidence in the evidence contributing to several of these review findings. Further research, especially in low- and middle-income settings and with different cadres of healthcare providers, could strengthen the evidence for low- or very low confidence findings. Ahead of implementation of labour companionship, researchers and programmers should consider factors that may affect implementation, including training content and timing for providers, women and companions; physical structure of the labour ward; specifying clear roles for companions and providers; integration of companions; and measuring the impact of companionship on women's experiences of care. Implementation research or studies conducted on labour companionship should include a qualitative component to evaluate the process and context of implementation, in order to better interpret results and share findings across contexts.

AB  - This article explores the dynamics of policy change and innovation in the context of the security crises in Nuevo Le & oacute;n, Mexico, drawing insight from past experiences and ongoing challenges. From 2003 to 2023, with an emphasis on 2006-2011, the article examines the role of the state government and civil participation in shaping innovative policy responses. Key findings highlight the importance of collaboration between government, civil society, and the private sector in developing effective and sustainable solutions. While successful initiatives like the establishment of Fuerza Civil demonstrate the potential of public innovation, challenges such as funding uncertainties and changes in political leadership underscore the need for institutionalized mechanisms for collaboration and evaluation. The article concludes by emphasizing the importance of transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in policymaking processes; and advocating for continued civil engagement to address security challenges and foster a safer and more resilient future.

AB  - Thousands of plants, fungi, and lichen species are traded every year. Although sustainable use is critical for livelihoods and biodiversity conservation, insufficient data prevent detailed sustainability assessments for most species. How can the sustainability of trade in such data-deficient species be enhanced? We considered a country-level example of 300 medicinal and aromatic plant, fungus, and lichen species traded in tens of thousands of tons worth tens of millions of US dollars in and from Nepal annually. Past interventions have not ensured sustainable trade, leaving species vulnerable to commercial harvesting and threatening rural household incomes, the processing industry, and government revenues. Building on documented evidence and stakeholder involvement, we used a theory of change approach to develop a sustainable management approach. We produced a draft plan (roadmap) by combining interventions proposed at annual key stakeholder dialogue meetings with recommendations extracted from a literature review on the trade and conservation of commercial medicinal and aromatic plants, fungi, and lichens in Nepal. The draft roadmap was discussed at a national workshop with sector-wide stakeholder representation to derive the final roadmap. The literature review showed the 41 causal assumptions and theoretical explanations for actions and outcomes. Feedback mechanisms included 6 bundles of mutually reinforcing actions, such as the relationship between increased cultivation and decreased wild harvesting. The roadmap has 5 pathways: increase cultivation, strengthen local management, support domestic businesses, improve sector governance, and increase international collaboration. Each pathway is associated with 2-5 actions (e.g., hand over high-elevation areas to local communities) that lead to outputs (2-5) (e.g., an increased area under local management) and outcomes (2-6) (e.g., less overharvesting). Accordingly, the roadmap offers stakeholders a structured approach to implement future activities and investments to enhance sustainable trade. The approach can be replicated for other countries and products.
