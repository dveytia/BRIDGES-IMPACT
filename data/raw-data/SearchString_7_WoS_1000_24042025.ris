AB  - Evaluative research can advance sustainability education through the learning it can enable, at micro systems levels. This proposition is explored by examining evaluation practice in a 6-year international programme entitled Transdisciplinary Education Collaboration for Transformations in Sustainability involving universities and biosphere reserves/regions in Germany, South Africa and Canada. Transdisciplinary International Learning Lab (TILL) was evaluated using a theory-based evaluation approach and interviews, focus groups and questionnaires that yielded qualitative data. Through meta reflection, we concluded that our TILL had elements of a Field School, rather than a Learning Lab, that our curriculum required more explicit deliberation among programme developers and implementers towards a deeper and shared understanding of pedagogical assumptions and more congruent practice of transdisciplinary and transformative sustainability education. The reflective, theory-based approach enabled learning from evaluation and was captured in a shared refinement of the theory of change, which makes it explicit that learning from pedagogical innovations is not only for students but also for academics. The paper is an invitation to other innovators in sustainability science, education and evaluation in higher education, to share related findings.

AB  - Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) has been gaining traction as a promising approach for addressing social challenges and driving positive change within society. The purpose of this article is to explore how ESD can be foregrounded to reframe and enrich an existing learning framework called the Interdisciplinary Collaborative Online Learning Framework (ICoL). The ICoL framework has been developed since 2020 using a Design-based Research methodology. Literature on ESD lacks exploration of practical implementation for interdisciplinary collaborative projects within communities. This article interrogates the question of how to integrate ESD within the ICoL learning framework. This study is explorative, and data are drawn from a review of the literature and student reflections. A qualitative, themed analysis of the data revealed a fifth learning design principle and a fourth structuring element towards a new learning framework, called the Sustainable-Smart Transdisciplinary Learning Framework.

AB  - Ecotourism offers several economic, environmental, and cultural benefits; however, even after all these years, achieving ecotourism sustainability is still complex because of multiple stakeholders with diversified interests and influence. This study focused on the multiple stakeholders' complexity and management for achieving sustainable ecotourism in Penang Hill in Malaysia. Understanding the existence of multiple stakeholders with varying interests and their respective power of influence is critical for a tourism destination to be sustainable. This study aimed to create a multi-stakeholder management framework and understand stakeholder management's mediating role toward ecotourism sustainability in Penang Hill. Data were collected from Penang Hill key stakeholders and analyzed using SmartPLS and fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA). The findings revealed that stakeholder management plays a significant mediating role in achieving ecotourism sustainability. Stakeholders' interests and their level of influence should be understood to develop engagement, empowerment, and monitoring strategies for managing stakeholders. Thus, the study contributes by validating the results through symmetric and asymmetric techniques, offering solutions to the emerging issues during the Covid-19 pandemic, and recommending policy changes. Lastly, the study also extends prior literature by displaying the mediating role played by stakeholder management on ecotourism sustainability, comparing indirect and total effects on stakeholder management support for achieving sustainable ecotourism in Penang Hill.

AB  - Ecotourism brings many economic, environmental, and socio-cultural benefits to the tourism destination, but its implementation is not simple. Several studies in the past have shown the importance of including stakeholders for the development of ecotourism in the area. Understanding stakeholders varied interests and their power of influence is vital to achieve sustainability in a tourism destination. The study aimed to develop a multi-stakeholder management model that could unite stakeholders towards achieving sustainable ecotourism in the area. A critical synthesis of the literature was conducted by classifying and then critically reviewing the literature to construct and integrate the variables that could help in the better management of stakeholders, which would lead towards the development of a framework that can guide in achieving sustainability in ecotourism. This study validates previous findings and also directs to develop a sustainable ecotourism framework through which the environmental, social, and economic benefits can be achieved in the destination. Understanding multiple stakeholders helps to achieve sustainability and, as a result, makes the tourist destination experience better for both the visitor and host. The developed model would add value to the literature by enriching tourism destination stakeholders understanding, precisely related to the multiple stakeholder management, and leads to achieving ecotourism sustainability.

AB  - This paper deals with the development of scientific policy advice by providing a methodology to foster a social learning process. The methodology, called participatory Sustainability Impact Assessment (pSIA), aims to structure complex problem situations, to clarify interests and basic assumptions, to interpret scientific studies, to develop impact assessment, and to explore sensitivity of uncertainty and lack of information. In pSIA workshops the participants are supposed to build conceptual models with different modelling methods, like System Dynamics, Value Chain Analysis, and Morphological Analysis. A case study is presented that describes a workshop series with political as well as academic actors, applying the pSIA approach to an impact assessment of Economic Partnership Agreements between the European Union and the Eastern and Southern Africa Region.

AB  - Learning and transdisciplinary research are widely acknowledged as key components for achieving sustainability; however, the links between these concepts remain vague in the sustainability literature. Recently, emphasis has been given to transdisciplinary learning, highlighting its potential as an approach that contributes to solving real-world problems. To better understand and foster transdisciplinary learning for sustainability transformations, it is relevant to pay attention to two dimensions that define transdisciplinary learning: social interaction (individual learning in a social setting, as a group, or beyond the group), and learning forms (single-, double-, or triple-loop learning). This article introduces a conceptual framework built upon these two dimensions to understand three specific forms of transdisciplinary learning as a) individual competence development, b) experience-based collaboration, and c) societal interaction. This framework helps to clarify the design of learning processes as well as their interactions in transdisciplinary processes to support transformative change.

AB  - Achieving sustainability-related targets in construction projects is increasingly becoming a key performance driver. Yet sustainability is a complex concept in projects and there are many diverse stakeholders. Some stakeholders are generally recognized as important, i.e., the client and main contractor, yet there are others not always perceived as such and whose absence from the decision-making processes may result in a failure to address sustainability issues. Hence there is a need for a systematic approach to engage with stakeholders with high salience in relation to sustainability. This paper reports the results of an exploratory study involving interviews with construction project practitioners that are involved in sustainability in some way. Data were collected from the practitioners in terms of the processes for engaging with stakeholders to deliver sustainability. The data suggests six steps to a stakeholder engagement process: (i) identification; (ii) relating stakeholders to different sustainability-related targets; (iii) prioritization; (iv) managing; (v) measuring performance; and (vi) putting targets into action. The results suggest that understanding the different sustainability agendas of stakeholders and measuring their performance using key performance indicators are important stages to be emphasized in any stakeholder engagement process to achieve sustainability-related goals.

AB  - Achieving sustainability is becoming increasingly critical for measuring the overall success of infrastructure projects. Given the complexity of such projects, the successful management of sustainability-related targets requires joint efforts from the major stakeholders involved, including project clients, contractors, suppliers, and the general public. Nevertheless, these stakeholders often have different, and sometimes even conflicting, concerns regarding the achievement of project sustainability. Confrontations and disputes can arise unless these concerns are carefully analyzed and addressed. However, we know little specifically about how major stakeholders perceive infrastructure sustainability and how their concerns differ in the three dimensions of project sustainability: economic, environmental, and social sustainability. This study investigated the major concerns of stakeholders in achieving sustainability in a typical infrastructure project (i.e., railway projects). A triangulated methodology was adopted, including a literature review, a questionnaire survey, and interviews to obtain data from project stakeholders. Based on the results, there was a significant divergence of views among stakeholder groups, and conflicts arose when there was a mismatch between stakeholders' perceptions. A list of major concerns from each individual stakeholder group was ranked and discussed. Some measures for promoting the consensus on achieving project sustainability among different stakeholder groups were also provided. The study not only provides insights into understanding differences in the concerns of major stakeholder groups in achieving railway project sustainability, it also helps develop quantitative approaches for measuring the degree of consensus and conflict among major stakeholder groups so as to minimize their concern differences.

AB  - Transdisciplinary co-production of knowledge is widely credited with producing knowledge that can contribute to sustainability transformations, but there is little empirical evidence showing to what extent and through what mechanisms it is actually advancing sustainability. This article analyses how 31 transdisciplinary projects conceptualised the link between transdisciplinary co-production of knowledge and sustainability transformations, and as part of an institutional learning process explores what experiences projects garnered while implementing their theories of change. The research identified three generic conceptualisations of impact generation mechanisms: a) promoting systems, target, and transformation knowledge for more informed and equitable decision-making, b) fostering social learning for collective action, and c) enhancing competences for reflective leadership. It also identified seven different strategies through which the studied projects implemented these three generic mechanisms to induce sustainability transformations. Exploring potentials and limitations of the different mechanisms, the article concludes that the question is not which mechanisms or strategies are better than others, but in what situation and combination they might be most promising.

AB  - As the COVID-19 pandemic began to spread all over the world, many educational institutions have shifted to a full-time online teaching mode. Although online teaching has been widely explored, the unprecedented initiatives of mass-scale full-time online education at the secondary school level are yet to be unravelled. By using a qualitative approach and drawing on the conceptualisation of learning engagement and Community of Inquire model as conceptual frameworks, this study explored how secondary school students in China engaged with online education during the COVID-19 pandemic and what factors influenced their sustainable online learning engagement. This research examined the perspectives of twenty-four students and five teachers through semi-structured interviews and observations of online classes. Findings indicate that the students' online learning engagement involved three inter-related categories: emotional, cognitive and behavioural engagement. Contextual factors influencing the sustainability of students' online learning engagement were identified by the participants, including teacher presence, parental involvement, and a supportive learning environment/community. The findings in this paper have implications for teacher development, family support and establishment of e-teaching platforms in emergency remote teaching for young students. Finally, the study puts forward best practices for the sustainable development of the emergency remote teaching in the future public crises.

AB  - Actors working on global climate and sustainability challenges are faced with two competing imperatives: first, there is an ever-expanding body of knowledge, networks and initiatives generating new insights that should be shared. Second, we see a growing recognition that fly-in, fly-out conferencing practices are an insufficient and unsustainable model for learning, boundary crossing and collaboration towards sustainability transformations. Against this backdrop, we argue that knowledge exchange for societal transformations needs to consider three interrelated dimensions: (1) equity and inclusion - access to and representation in both process and content for all, (2) low carbon - limits the ecological burden produced by the exchange, and (3) impact - outcomes at individual and collective levels that enhance our ability to act. How we navigate the tensions that may emerge from these dimensions is a matter of pressing importance. This research article examines the potential of multi-sited dialogues as an approach to co-producing transdisciplinary solutions by using the three dimensions as the analytical framework. We report on a series of dialogue-focused conference sessions convened at three international conferences in 2023. Our findings describe the contributions that the multi-sited dialogue process brought to knowledge co-production across space and time, and the contribution of facilitation practices to the outcomes of these dialogues. We also introduce and discuss the set of principles for transforming sustainable conferencing practices that were co-produced over the three dialogues.

AB  - Purpose This paper aims to showcase and critically review the value of selected pedagogies in which real-world engagements are used to enhance sustainability learning in an open, distance and e-learning (ODeL) context in the Global South. The paper considers opportunities, issues, alternatives and implementation guidelines. Design/methodology/approach The School of Ecological and Human Sustainability (University of South Africa) serves as case study, with blended and fully online learning used as examples of pedagogies. The assessment of these pedagogies uses examples of learning activities and exercises, critical reflections on feedback by lecturers and students and consideration against criteria for real-world learning. Findings The experiences showcased illustrate that despite challenges in ODeL, real-world engagements can be used successful as pedagogy for sustainability learning in the Global South context. Limited access to ICTs can be mitigated through mobile technologies and free and open software applications, as illustrated by the examples in this paper. Research limitations/implications The case study approach and qualitative methodology present limitations, with focus on only two examples. However, significant depth is achieved with the assessment of these examples, while the recommendations and lessons learnt can be applied in other contexts, thus expanding on the knowledge and experience in this field. Originality/value This paper showcases innovative approaches to incorporate real-world engagements for sustainability learning in ODeL. Application of real-world engagements in ODeL in the Global South context is original and addresses the need for teaching and learning strategies responding to the digital divide and contributing to expand access to higher education and an Afrocentric discourse to best practice.

AB  - Sustainable development is an important United Nations agenda, and the determination of which of the sustainable development goals (SDGs) should be prioritized is left up to each participating nation. Stakeholder engagement including all members of society can engender a nationally representative priority SDG set. This research investigates inclusive sustainable development which incorporates an approach to stakeholder engagement. The study assesses precedential scholarship of stakeholder engagement and sustainability evaluation, identifying a gap in terms of the inclusion of householder perceived importance of lifestyle related factors in sustainable development policy making and evaluation. Utilizing a case study of the aging, shrinking population of Japan, a representative, national survey of householders is undertaken, demonstrating that lifestyle relevant factors of sustainability approximate jurisdictionally important United Nations SDGs and help to identify priority targets within these goals. Perceived importance variety across household generations is also identified, providing guidance for policy makers in terms of age-relevant policy making and jurisdictionally important cultural factors. The framework proposed has applications in the case-study nation and is also readily applicable to other jurisdictions and for use in comparative studies. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose Studies on sustainability in energy transition in the electricity sector require a new approach of modifying the indicators from the energy trilemma index. The cocreation variable was used as a mediator to promote collaborative engagement of all stakeholders in the electricity sector to achieve energy transition sustainably. This study aims to investigate the arguments presented above. Design/methodology/approach This study adopted a quantitative method that combined structural equation modeling and partial least squares analysis. ADANCO was used to analyze the data gathered from power system expert engineers through an online questionnaire survey. Findings Power system expert engineers play an important role in collaborative stakeholder engagement and cocreation as mediators for achieving sustainability. The expert engineers were willing to collaborate with stakeholders, while ensuring an engaging learning experience. Notably, dialogue that provides mutual access and transparency in assuming risk strengthened the cocreation effect. Research limitations/implications The mediating effect of cocreation becomes important when there are antecedents related to stakeholder collaboration. Studies that used data from expert engineers having more than ten years of experience used cocreation as an antecedent, either independently, through mediation or by depending on the sustainability goals. Practical implications This study has implications on the power sector in Indonesia, which relies on coal-fired power plants. This study proposes empowering expert engineers to collaborate with stakeholders to achieve energy decarbonization. Originality/value Aspects of the energy trilemma index were used to investigate the expert engineers' perspective regarding energy security, energy equity and environmental sustainability, parameters which were modified to reflect their behavioral tendencies to achieve sustainability in the electricity sector.

AB  - Participatory approaches can be seen as a requirement, but also as a benefit to the overall paradigm change towards sustainable development and contribute towards the integration of sustainability concept into the university culture. So far, there have been comparatively few research studies on participation within sustainability implementation at university level, and a more differentiated understanding of these processes is still missing, both in the practice of conducting a participatory process and in the sustainability assessment. This paper addresses some of the failures and successes experienced within participatory approaches in campus sustainability initiatives, and deduces a set of critical success factors and emergent clusters that can help to integrate the dimensions of participation more inclusively into sustainability assessment. Following a qualitative approach and inspired by the Delphi-method, semi-structured expert interviews (N = 15) and four focus group discussions (N = 36), with participants coming from twenty different countries in total, were conducted and compared according to qualitative content analysis. Findings give empirical evidence to some of the characteristics related to stakeholder engagement, and associate higher education for sustainable development to empowerment and capacity building, shifting away from a previous focus on environmental sustainability. The success of participatory approaches is interdependent with structural institutional conditions and the persons engaged, highlighting the importance of specific skills and participatory competencies. A better integration of the dimensions of participation into sustainability assessment practices can help in defining and establishing participatory approaches on institutional level and fostering a culture of participation in the transition to sustainable universities.

AB  - This paper provides an outline to this portion of the two part special volume on knowledge collaboration and learning for sustainable innovation, which is built upon papers from the ERSCP portion of the joint ERSCP/EMSU conference. This paper briefly reviews the topic of sustainable innovation, based upon the levels of niche, incremental and systemic innovation. A review of the literature on learning, knowledge collaboration and participation shows that niche innovations and systemic innovation typically require so-called '2nd order learning processes', in which tacit knowledge and implicit frames have to be adjusted. This 2nd order learning process is less needed in case of incremental innovations. Another relevant dimension that appears from the literature is the distinction about whether actors involved in change are active in niches or mainstream. Subsequently, the ten papers in this portion of the special joint volume are highlighted. They cover a broad range of relevant topics, such as learning in innovation systems, system innovations at the local level, learning and collaboration in knowledge arenas, application of design scenarios and participatory backcasting, involvement of end-users in energy saving and energy efficient refurbishment and collaboration among participants in global sustainability programs. Together, these papers provide an overview of learning, knowledge collaboration and participation for sustainable innovation and consumption. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Imagining sustainable food futures is key to effectively transforming food systems. Yet even transdisciplinary approaches struggle to open up complex and highly segregated food policy governance for co-production and can fail to critically interrogate assumptions, worldviews, and values. In this Perspective we argue that transdisciplinary processes concerned with sustainable food system transformation need to meaningufully engage with critical food futures, and can do so through the use of soft scenario methods to learn about, play with, and experiment in futures. Specifically, soft scenarios contribute in four ways: 1) questioning widely held assumptions about the future; 2) being inclusive to multiple perspectives and worldviews; 3) fostering receptiveness to unimaginable futures; 4) developing futures literacy. Based on insights from a 5-year transdisciplinary action research project on sustainable food transformation across Asia, we demonstrate how these processes play out in narratives, serious games and interactive art featuring soft scenarios. We conclude by discussing the potential for collaboration between transdisciplinary and futures researchers, especially for transforming food systems.

AB  - Sustainable agricultural development (SAD) requires empowerment and engagement of all actors in the agricultural production and supply chain to enable change. This paper proposes a novel framework for Participatory Sustainable Agricultural Development (PSAD) that distinguishes four main classes of factors that influence participation in SAD: environmental, economic, social and governance-related. The factors in each of these classes are analysed in relation to their effect over time, on the basis of 49 SAD programmes reported in the literature. Findings show that the social factors of engagement and empowerment, not often addressed in existing SAD programmes, are of significant influence to effect over time, as are the environmental factors of food safety, and the economic factors of production and capacity development. As such this paper shows that in in addition to the well-acknowledged need for knowledge and skills related to food safety, production and capacity development, SAD programmes also need to address the social factors of engagement and empowerment to enable sustainable change over time for SAD through participation.

AB  - Policies at multiple levels pronounce the need to encompass both social and ecological systems in governance and management of natural capital in terms of resources and ecosystems. One approach to knowledge production and learning about landscapes as social-ecological systems is to compare multiple case studies consisting of large spaces and places. We first review the landscape concepts' biophysical, anthropogenic, and intangible dimensions. Second, we exemplify how the different landscape concepts can be used to derive measurable variables for different sustainability indicators. Third, we review gradients in the three dimensions of the term landscape on the European continent, and propose to use them for the stratification of multiple case studies of social-ecological systems. We stress the benefits of the landscape concepts to measure sustainability, and how this can improve collaborative learning about development toward sustainability in social-ecological systems. Finally, analyses of multiple landscapes improve the understanding of context for governance and management.

AB  - In the United Kingdom (UK), over the past three decades efforts have been made to ensure adequate promotion of sustainability objectives through various policy initiatives. However, despite the effort and the existence of these policy initiatives, sustainability projects in particular, regeneration projects are yet to deliver their intended sustainability objectives. While there is a rise in demand for higher sustainability benefits by stakeholders such as clients, communities and policy makers, the delivery of sustainability benefits from sustainability regeneration projects are yet to meet the expectations of these stakeholders. This article provides an overview of sustainability benefits within the context of the sustainable regeneration projects in the UK from a study that examines the roles and sustainability drivers of construction practitioners towards the promotion of sustainability on their regeneration projects. To do so, a qualitative research approach is adopted using a semi-structured interview technique for the study. The data obtained was analysed using content analysis. The findings revealed that out of the eight socio-economic sustainability drivers presented to practitioners, enhancement of reputation was the most important 'socio-economic' sustainability driver while the least important driver was legislative and legal requirement. The findings further revealed that majority of practitioners/organisations were promoting the socio-economic sustainability driver they believed will enable them to meet their own corporate business objectives.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to develop and validate an authentic contextual learning framework with six constructs to model the relationships among essential factors of authentic contextual learning. In particular, this framework explores the relationships across six constructs, i.e. learning by applying, healthy learning, collaborative learning, creativity, sustainability, and scalability. A total of 99 learners participated in this study. All learners had to fill out a questionnaire; then, the data were analyzed using exploratory factor analysis and partial least square analysis. The result shows that the developed framework has a good predictive power for evaluating the effectiveness of a sustainable and scalable authentic contextual learning (SSACL) design. From the results, it was found that learning by applying not only can unlock learners' imagination and enhance high cognition development thereby helping creativity but also can sustain learning motivation (sustainability). In addition, learning by applying can make learners intend to do more learning tasks in different contexts, which promotes learners' interests to do more applications in authentic contexts (scalability). Moreover, learning by applying can also give learners a healthy learning experience by moving their body, walking, and breathe fresh air outside, thereby can help their health as well.

AB  - This article demonstrates how community-based action research can be conducted in democratic and democratizing ways to enable young people to take action to improve their own circumstances. By means of a case study, I show how Participatory Action Learning and Action Research (PALAR) can enable sustainable learning and development. Findings reveal that the youth participants benefitted from their participation in the PALAR research project in terms of increasedself-esteem and sense of purpose, enhanced self-awareness, and improved communication and technical skills, all of which developed their capacity for contributing to their communities and exercising leadership. However, the process of action learning was challenging for both the youth participants of the community and the university research partner. The findings corroborate that action learning takes time to learn, but unless it becomes an integral part of the action research process, the ability of community participants to sustain change is compromised. These findings are significant for enabling research that contributes to social justice through enhancing individual and community capacity to be critically reflective action learners and action leaders.

AB  - Place-based social-ecological research is crucial for understanding local sustainability challenges. However, lack of transferability of insights to other locations and to larger scales remains challenging. In this paper, we present a novel transdisciplinary learning framework that links notions of cultural heritage, landscape, and social-ecological systems thinking to support sustainable rural development. Continuous dialogue, learning, and collaboration among communities and stakeholders, including researchers, take centre stage in this framework. We outline the four steps of the framework, conceptually integrating and operationalising how dialogue, learning, and collaboration can take place in each step. We tested the framework in the CULTIVATE project (https://www. cultivate-project.net), which explored the role of cultural heritage narratives in supporting sustainable rural development in four European UNESCO Biosphere Reserves. The framework successfully guided our research and comparative cross-case analysis, thereby contributing to aggregate learnings from place-based social-ecological research to develop knowledge at the national or global scale.

AB  - Collaboration between firms is important to stimulate the transition to a more sustainable society. This special volume shows that collaboration is indeed one of the preferred forms of governance to manage relations between firms in a sustainability context. Collaboration enhances sustainable benefits by creating legitimacy of sustainable technologies, reducing waste and improving environmental and social performance of firms. The institutional environment, in particular environmental laws and regulations, has a beneficial impact on collaboration and relationship management in sustainable supply chains. Two studies in this special volume show, however, that stringent environmental regulations may hinder economic performance and result in outsourcing to foreign suppliers with potential detrimental effects for environmental performance. These negative effects can be overcome by firms that invest in sustainable innovation. This special volume also shows that eco-innovation leads to sustainable benefits, such as lower greenhouse gas emissions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The decolonisation of curricula in higher education has been receiving increasing attention over the past decade. However, to date, there appears to have been limited consideration within the context of tourism curricula in formerly colonised countries. Given that academics are primarily responsible for the development, revision and delivery of curricula, the purpose of this qualitative study was to explore the perceptions of decolonising tourism curricula as held by tourism academics in higher education in South Africa. Semantic and inductive thematic analysis was undertaken on responses elicited from 19 participants who completed an online, open-ended survey. Seven key themes were generated from the data including complexity, independence, stakeholder engagement, dynamic transformation, contextualisation, sustainability and multilingualism. These preliminary insights lay the foundation for furthering the conversation among tourism programmes teams on curricula transformation that promotes diversity and inclusivity.

AB  - Real -world labs and transdisciplinary urban research aim to initiate and support sustainability transformations. This paper explores the categories of societal impacts and their connections, as well as key principles to facilitate these impacts. The study is based on the empirical analysis of 48 projects by a series of surveys and interviews within an independent, accompanying research program. All projects were conducted under the heading of urban sustainability transformations and pursued a transdisciplinary real -world lab approach. Three categories of societal impacts were identified: 1. social and individual changes, 2. governance changes, and 3. changes in the physical environment. Six of the projects were selected as in-depth case studies, revealing three patterns of impact pathways. The case studies also explore the relationships between processes, results, and impacts leading to key principles for fostering societal impacts and thus, sustainability transformations. The findings enhance the understanding and the promotion of sustainability transformations in urban areas.

AB  - Collaborative learning is perceived as an important component of Information Communication Technologies (ICT) integration in schools. The purpose of this study was to examine an initiative of the Ministry of Education that promoted intra-school and inter-school digital collaborative learning projects. The participants were 159 district ICT leaders, who designed 37 digital collaborative projects containing 73 learning activities to promote inter-school student interactions. The study was conducted within the qualitative research paradigm through analysis of digital collaborative learning activities. Additionally, the participants were required to share their experiences regarding digital collaboration through an open-ended online questionnaire. The thematic analysis revealed all four levels of the SAMR model, rating pedagogical changes during technological integration; the most common were the model's two middle levels: Augmentation and Modification. Moreover, we explored the degree of teamwork (information sharing, cooperation, or collaboration), complexity of collaboration (intra-school vs. inter-school) and sustainability of collaborative learning within the school culture. Most of the activities reflected the cooperation level of teamwork, while in the highest level-collaboration was less common. Surprisingly, complexity of collaboration and its sustainability in school culture were negatively interconnected. Regarding the extent of collaboration, some activities were categorized as "Islands of innovation," the majority were comprehensive and conducted on the organizational level, while only few involved the wider community-parents or other stakeholders. Based on the bottom-up analysis of pedagogical changes in digital collaboration activities, we suggested a comprehensive e-CSAMR framework. The implications for educational theory and practice are discussed.

AB  - Reading and writing climate fiction may aid humanity in imagining more sustainable futures. Yet typical approaches to investigating environmental literacy neglect the collective nature of learning and imagination. This exploratory study adopts a socioculturally-informed complex systems approach to analyze collective imagination for sustainability transformations during a collaborative climate fiction writing activity in a high-school classroom. Discourse data were qualitatively coded at two analytic levels-individual talk turns and collective imagination episodes-and nonlinear computational analysis techniques were used to examine the multilevel time series data. Results suggest that (1) collaborative climate fiction writing catalyzed the emergence of collective imagination for sustainability transformations, (2) group interaction processes exhibited chaotic dynamics, and (3) collective imagination was triggered and sustained by a flow of ideas among group members who drew upon existing fiction stories as cultural resources to support their imagination processes. This approach may help address the methodology gap in collective environmental literacy studies.

AB  - The notion of sustainability has received increased attention among marketers, and in theory. Though studies have discussed the crucial role of sustainable practices in shaping consumer responses, the role that perceived sustainability plays in engaging customers, and its effect on customer responses has received less attention. The study aims to determine the effect of perceived sustainability on customer loyalty and trust through the mediation of customer engagement. 330 responses were collected to test the proposed model. Structural equation modeling was used to test the hypothesis. The main findings of the study revealed a significant and positive effect of perceived sustainability on customer loyalty and trust. Further, we found that customer engagement acts as mediator between perceived sustainability and trust association. However, the results indicate that customer engagement does not mediate the link between perceived sustainability and loyalty. Extending sustainability and customer engagement literature, the study presents empirical evidence towards the direct effect of perceived sustainability on customer loyalty and trust as well as the indirect effect on trust via customer engagement. The study suggests practitioners develop a strategy that could incorporate sustainability initiatives in marketing programs because these initiatives may engage customers and affect their responses (i.e., loyalty and trust).

AB  - Purpose - This paper aims to explain the relevance of science-society interfaces and their potential for higher education institutions to engage stakeholders in supporting sustainable change in cities, via the transdisciplinary learning and teaching approach of the Regional Centre of Expertise on Education for Sustainable Development Vienna.
   Design/methodology/approach - This case study stresses new forms of transdisciplinary learning and teaching as essential drivers of a sustainable urban development. The inter-and transdisciplinary teaching course "Sustainability Challenge", which has been offered since 2010 as a collaborative project by the four largest universities of Vienna, highlights the value of experienced-based learning approaches and the method of service learning. Special attention is devoted to the opportunities and challenges of the setting provided by the applied science-society interface and the particular method of service learning with its concrete benefits for the city of Vienna.
   Findings - In analyzing the conceptual framework of the teaching course as well as conducted service learning projects, the authors prove potential benefits of transdisciplinary learning and teaching for real answers to urban sustainability challenges. Portraits of the most successful service learning projects are presented, with partners such as the City of Vienna, an organization and one enterprise.

AB  - While technology-based developments have produced a wealth of information and experience, the rate of interaction between the academic institutions and craftsmanship establishments is observed to decrease gradually. The purpose of this study is to enable the transfer of tacit knowledge and experience between these two foundations by creating learning bridges through the use of technology in order to achieve sustainability in local crafts in long term. The qualitative multi-method approach adopted, which included the use of participatory design methodology and ethnographic field study in the Mardin. The study indicated that learning bridges could be formed and thus facilitate the transfer of tacit knowledge and experience between the academy and workshops through the use of technology. A sustainable educational model presenting a new interactive experience was recommended in light of the findings.

AB  - Local governments are addressing energy transition, one of the prominent sustainability goals in the urban agendas, yet they need to enhance capacity building, therefore engagement with sustainability science and adult learning programs for civil servants are frequently activated. Landscape architects are more frequently called to be boundary spanners in complex sustainability goals. This perspective essay investigates the synergetic links between adult learning approaches and landscape architecture research through design in the prominent field of the transition to renewable energy. The reflections will be narrated by means of a first application conducted for the Municipality of Amsterdam. The tentative implications suggest that a social learning environment finds synergetic links to a constructivist research through design approach.

KW  - KNOWLEDGE
AB  - Sustainable development has become a policy goal, but measuring progress towards this goal is complex and may be subjective. Water policy is a key component of sustainable development - environmental, social and economic sustainability - since water is a fundamental human need. Here we summarise some challenges for evaluating the sustainability of water policies in Mediterranean countries and the approach developed in the SWAP project (Mediterranean dialogue on framing Sustainability in WAter Policy evaluation). We review the attributes of sustainability, discuss several evaluation approaches and tools highlighting their strengths and contributions, and outline the challenges to water policy evaluation. We present and discuss an example framework to evaluate the sustainability of water policy in Mediterranean countries, based on transdisciplinary participation to evaluate governance aspects. We conclude that the evaluation of sustainable water policies does not have an ultimately unambiguous result and we propose that sustainability evaluation needs to establish a public discourse that considers the three pillars of sustainability (environmental, social and economic), their interaction and the process.

AB  - In 2018, a group of faculty members and students from King Mongkut's Institute of Technology, Ladkrabang (KMITL), and Royal College of Art (RCA) organized workshops and field trips to Sukhothai province in Thailand to explore the livelihood along with cultural heritages, social practices, and sustainable learning by the inhabitants of communities in Si Satchanalai district. Conceptually informed by Spencer Kagan's notion of Cooperative and Collaborative (C&C) sustainable learning approach employed by the KMITL-RCA collaborations, this research examined the 2018 workshops and excursions for their roles in 1) advancing tacit knowledge on the artistic and architectural heritages of Si Satchanalai; and 2) bridging a horizon of understanding between Thai and foreign students. In order to assess the pedagogical efficacy of the C&C approach, the upcoming evaluative discussions encompassed a series of dependent sample t-tests, utilizing several questionnaires, surveys, and personal conversations for collecting data to construct a content model in terms of comparative studies between the KMITL and RCA participants. Not only did the statistical inquiries: 1) validate the methodological applicability of the C&C edifying model but also 2) demonstrate its merits in promoting cross-cultural learning in architectural and design discipline.

AB  - Dealing with complex societal problems requires transdisciplinary approaches and competencies. Inspired by debates on transformative teaching and participatory filmmaking, we show how we used the social learning video method to teach transdisciplinary competencies in a university setting. Using the design of future railway stations as an example, students interacted with external practice partners in real-world problem situations. As part of this process, they became aware of their own professional perspectives and critically reflected on the perspectives of their practice partners and the differences in their understanding of sustainability. In addition, they developed numerous transdisciplinary competences, such as defining a problem together, conducting group discussions and interviews, mediating among different viewpoints, allowing a common language to develop, and triggering "AHA!" moments in joint film screenings. As part of transdisciplinary and transformative teaching, it is important to provide access to external practice partners and working environments, enable students to engage and reflect, and provide nurturing and challenging framework conditions.

AB  - Emerging technologies are increasingly promoted on the promise of tackling the grand challenge of sustainability. A range of assessment and governance approaches seek to evaluate these claims, but these tend to be applied disparately and lack widespread operationalisation. They also face specific challenges, such as high levels of uncertainty, when it comes to emerging technologies. Building and reflecting on both theory and practice, this article develops a framework for Constructive Sustainability Assessment (CSA) that enables the application of sustainability assessments to emerging technologies as part of a broader deliberative approach. In order to achieve this, we discuss and critique current approaches to analytical sustainability assessment and review deliberative social science governance frameworks. We then develop the conceptual basis of CSA - blending life-cycle thinking with principles of responsible research and innovation. This results in four design principles - transdisciplinarity, opening-up, exploring uncertainty and anticipation - that can be followed when applying sustainability assessments to emerging technologies. Finally, we discuss the practical implementation of the framework through a three-step process to (a) formulate the sustainability assessment in collaboration with stakeholders, (b) evaluate potential sustainability implications using methods such as anticipatory life-cycle assessment and (c) interpret and explore the results as part of a deliberative process. Through this, CSA facilitates a much-needed transdisciplinary response to enable the governance of emerging technologies towards sustainability. The framework will be of interest to scientists, engineers, and policy-makers working with emerging technologies that have sustainability as an explicit or implicit motivator. (C) 2019 The Authors.

AB  - Calls for supporting sustainability through more and better research rest on an incomplete understanding of scientific evidence use. We argue that a variety of barriers to a transformative impact of evidence arises from diverse actor motivations within different stages of evidence use. We abductively specify this variety in policy and practice arenas for three actor motivations (truth-seeking, sense-making, and utility-maximizing) and five stages (evidence production, uptake, influence on decisions, effects on sustainability outcomes, and feedback from outcome evaluations). Our interdisciplinary synthesis focuses on the sustainability challenge of reducing environmental and human health risks of agricultural pesticides. It identifies barriers resulting from (1) truth-seekers' desire to reduce uncertainty that is complicated by evidence gaps, (2) sense-makers' evidence needs that differ from the type of evidence available, and (3) utility-maximizers' interests that guide strategic evidence use. We outline context-specific research-policy-practice measures to increase evidence use for sustainable transformation in pesticides and beyond.

AB  - Tourism has the potential to contribute to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) agreed to by United Nations member states. For sustainable tourism to be successful, stakeholders must be involved in the process. The aim of this study is to consider the extent to which sustainable tourism contributes to achieving the SDGs and how tourism stakeholders understand and implement sustainable tourism. Specifically, the study adopted a qualitative approach and used the case study of Tobago. The data were collected using focus groups of tourism stakeholders. The research revealed that stakeholders embraced the SDGs despite a lack of understanding. They were unable to provide a comprehensive definition of sustainable tourism and their relation to the SDGs, but recognised its traditional components along with specific island features. Stakeholders more easily listed sustainable tourism practices and potential and their link to the SDGs. The barriers to sustainable tourism centred mainly on the role of the local governing body and political affiliation, dependency on the mainland, and prohibitive costs. Action is needed to facilitate broader stakeholder awareness and collaboration in support of efforts to enhance sustainable tourism and the achievement of the SDGs, where policymakers need to act as a catalyst for change.

AB  - Public participation is an important means of achieving sustainable development goals (SDGs) in western countries, but it's just in its infancy in China. Does public participation in China help reduce air pollutant emissions and contribute to sustainable development? In order to answer this question, effects of the China Air Pollution Map Application on industrial pollution emissions, a natural experiment in which the public participates in environmental protection, are evaluated by using the difference-in-differences method, It is found that the launch of the Map restrains the industrial pollution discharge to a certain extent. However, its marginal effect fluctuates with the passage of time, indicating that it is not a stable means for maintaining sustainable development. Only when government policies, public and enterprise participation are jointly involved can air pollutant emissions be effectively controlled and SDGs be ultimately achieved. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Purpose Sustainable development requires multiple stakeholders to work and learn across practices, in other words, it requires boundary crossing competence. To prepare students for their future sustainability professions, higher education should facilitate the development of boundary crossing competence in its curricula. This study aims to confirm whether boundary crossing learning can be stimulated by workshop-based support in multi-stakeholder projects. Design/methodology/approach This quasi-experimental intervention study (N = 122) investigates the effect of a series of supporting workshops on students' boundary crossing learning in multi-stakeholder projects. The workshops allowed students to adopt four learning mechanisms (identification, coordination, reflection and transformation) theorised to stimulate learning across boundaries between practices. Students followed zero, one, or two workshops. By analysing the student learning reports, the study examines the effect of the workshop intervention on students' self-efficacy for stakeholder collaboration, the number of reported student-stakeholder collaborative activities and the reported boundary crossing learning mechanisms. Findings The results show that a series of two workshops increase the number of reported collaborative activities and activates the students' boundary crossing learning in terms of reflection and transformation. Research limitations/implications These findings support the evidence-based design of multi-stakeholder learning environments for sustainable development and contribute to the body of knowledge regarding learning across practices. Originality/value Boundary crossing competence receives increasing attention as an asset for sustainable development. The added value of this study lies in its confirmation that the boundary crossing theory can be translated into directed educational support that can stimulate students' boundary crossing learning.

AB  - Corporate sustainable development (CSD) can help to force the life sciences industry (LSI) to move from responsibility towards accountability.
   In terms of sustainability issues, which currently affect and occupy the LSI and their stakeholders, one could speak of 4 generations:
   - The local side-effects of operations, production, distribution and use. - The effects and risks of the used and applied technologies and methods. - The affordability and access to essential available treatments and products. - The necessity and need for new essential products or treatments for neglected diseases.
   In order to make corporations accountable, there have been many efforts in the field of evaluation. These efforts mostly remain very general. The problem is however that the different stakeholders have diverse understandings of the various sustainability issues. The paper proposes a 2-phased stakeholder-oriented evaluation method for evaluating CSD-strategies on specific sustainability issues of the LSI in Basel, Switzerland. During the first phase, corporate commitment is challenged against the stakeholders' expectations. In the second phase, relevant stakeholders evaluate the effective corporate performance against the corporate commitment.
   The evaluation method was extensively tested with the stakeholders of the LSI in 5 case studies on the 4 issue generations. The method turned out to work and delivered interesting insight into managing sustainability issues. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose The paper examines three main stakeholders in the market and their roles toward achieving sustainability marketing. Those stakeholders are consumers, companies and policymakers. The current study is examining consumers' attitudes toward sustainability marketing and their purchase intentions of sustainable products through the use of theory of planned behavior. The paper is also examining the role of companies and policymakers in encouraging consumers to consider sustainability in their purchasing decisions. Design/methodology/approach Concurrent research study is applied, where qualitative and quantitative research methods are conducted at the same time for different purposes with equal weights. Qualitative interviews were applied with fast-moving consumer goods companies and policymakers, while quantitative surveys were applied with Egyptian consumers. Findings The results showed that companies are taking serious and effective steps in transforming their marketing strategies into sustainable marketing ones. The government role is still limited as there are no strict laws and regulations that force companies and factories in Egypt to develop sustainability marketing strategies. Consumers' attitudes were highly affected by firms' sustainable practices as well as subjective norms that led to influencing their intentions toward purchasing sustainable products. Originality/value Although the topic of sustainability marketing is considered by a plenty of researchers in the academic discipline, there are no studies that have combined the main three stakeholders' roles in achieving sustainability marketing in one study. The study highlights the impact of government role and firms' role on consumers' attitudes and purchase intentions toward sustainable products, especially convenient products. This was done through the adoption of the theory of planned behavior.

AB  - Long-term sustainability transformation requires a nuanced understanding of the value priorities among key stakeholders across diverse spatial scales. This study unravels these priorities among two vital stakeholder groups in Hungary - mayors and school principals - when contemplating local, national, and global sustainability challenges. The findings highlight how priorities manifest distinctly across these spatial scales and among different socio-demographic groups, revealing interesting patterns of spatial appreciation and discounting of certain priorities. A novel Sustainability Complexity (SC) indicator sheds light on stakeholders' balanced consideration of the three sustainability dimensions - Economy, Society, and Environment. The research also introduces the concept of Thinking-Attitude-Behaviour (TAB) priorities, such as mindset change and consumption reduction, with specific groups playing a pivotal role in driving broader societal sustainability transformations. Crucially, it identifies potential areas of misalignment between stakeholders' sustainability priorities and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), underscoring the need for greater dialogue and continued research for alignment. The findings contribute valuable insights to the design of more effective stakeholder engagement strategies and policy frameworks, bolstering the pursuit of sustainability transformation in alignment with the SDGs.

AB  - Transdisciplinary research, in which academics and actors from outside the academy co-produce knowledge, is an important approach to address urgent sustainability challenges. Indeed, to meet these real-world challenges, governments, universities, development agencies, and civil society organizations have made substantial investments in transdisciplinary partnerships. Yet to date, our understanding of the performance, as well as impacts, of these partnerships for sustainability is limited. Here, we provide a guide to assess the performance and impacts of transdisciplinary partnerships for sustainability. We offer key steps to navigate and examine the partnership process for continuous improvement, and to understand how transdisciplinary partnership is contributing to sustainable futures.

AB  - Phosphorus is a critical agricultural nutrient and a major pollutant in waterbodies due to inefficient use. In the form of rock phosphate it is a finite global commodity vulnerable to price shocks and sourcing challenges. Transforming toward sustainable phosphorus management involves local to global stakeholders. Conventional readings of stakeholders may not reflect system complexity leaving it difficult to see stakeholder roles in transformations. We attempt to remedy this issue with a novel stakeholder analysis method based on five qualitative pillars: stakeholder agency, system roles, power and influence, alignment to the problem, and transformational potential. We argue that our approach suits case studies of individual stakeholders, stakeholder groups, and organisations with relationships to sustainability challenges.

AB  - Healthcare redesign, based on building collaborative capacity between academic and clinical partners, should create a method to facilitate flow between the key elements of health service improvement. However, utilising the skills and resources of an organisation outside of the health facility may not always have the desired effect. Accountability and mutually respectful relationships are fundamental for collaborative, sustainable and successful completion of clinical research projects. This paper provides an academic perspective of both the benefits of academic involvement in facilitating healthcare redesign processes as well as the potential pitfalls of involving external partner institutions in internal healthcare redesign projects.

AB  - This study reports on the use of augmented reality (AR) within the context of sustainable engineering design education. The objective of this study is to understand students' collaboration and negotiation practices in a sustainable engineering design context using AR. The technology used in this study includes MERGE Cube (a physical cube that acts as a digital canvas for AR) and CoSpaces Edu (an online platform for students to build 3D creations and animate them with code). There have been 48 instances of student participation from upper elementary to middle school in four iterations of this study since February 2022. The research was conducted based on a design-based research methodology, and the data was collected through qualitative methods and analyzed using the intra-action analysis method. This study's outcome revealed that interactions among participant dyads and with the technology shed light on distinct dynamics within collaborative sustainability-oriented learning and design processes. These diverse interactions collectively emphasize the multifaceted nature of collaborative design, where individual experiences, communication styles, and technological proficiency all play integral roles in shaping the collaborative process. In addition, the results of our research showed that the complexities inherent in negotiating ownership and collaboration dynamics are influenced by individual attitudes, timing of involvement, and previous experiences. Given the importance of collaboration in achieving sustainability-oriented goals, these findings are relevant to the field of sustainable engineering education, especially when working with younger children.

AB  - This paper reports an exploration into critical success factors for the sustainability of the partnership between the University of Southern Queensland and the Stanthorpe community during the GraniteNet Phoenix Project - the first phase of a three-phase participatory action research project conducted during 2007-2008. The concepts of learning community, social capital, university-community engagement and partnerships, and co-generative learning through participatory action research and evaluation are brought together to provide a framework for evaluating the sustainability and efficacy of the university-community relationship in the context of the GraniteNet project. Implications of the findings for the ongoing sustainability of the partnership are discussed, as well as for the relevance and utility of identified critical success factors. The paper also discusses implications of the findings for university-community engagement partnerships that utilise participatory action research and evaluation processes to build capacity through co-generative learning.

AB  - The paper explores the mediating influence of citizen empowerment on the relationship between participatory monitoring and evaluation (PM&E) and social sustainability as a contribution to the ongoing debate on sustainability. The empirical investigation took the form of mixed-methods approach with the objectives to determine the extent to which PM&E influences citizen empowerment; establish the extent to which citizen empowerment influences social sustainability; and establish the joint influence of PM&E and citizen empowerment on social sustainability. The study employed a concurrent parallel design, in which samples for quantitative and qualitative components were different but drawn from the same population, and data collected within the same timeframe. Quantitative data were analyzed through bivariate and multiple regression analyses. Conversely, the qualitative component utilized interpretive technique and recursive abstraction to organize, summarize and give impression on the causal mechanisms at play in the quantitative data. Evidence from the study revealed that citizen empowerment mediates the relationship between PM&E and social sustainability. The study also found that when PM&E and citizen empowerment are considered together, citizen empowerment seems to have a dominant influence on social sustainability than PM&E itself. Thus, the government and development practitioners should prioritize citizen empowerment as a precursor to the realization of social sustainability outcomes.

AB  - Learning in collaborative governance is often recognized as an important component for sustainability transformation, but is mainly seen as a side-effect alongside governance outcomes. However, bringing together heterogeneous perspectives is crucial to fully capture the wicked sustainability challenges. We know very little about how learning is facilitated in collaborative governance. This empirical article assesses a multi-stakeholder initiative (MSI) and examines the extent to which it provides spaces for learning. It proposes an analytical framework for investigating social learning spaces along three prerequisites: diversity of member organizations, structure and quality of interactions. A qualitative and quantitative social network analysis (SNA) indicates that the Partnership for Sustainable Textiles (Textiles Partnership) has a large number of heterogeneous members, which holds great potential for learning. However, due to deliberative-democratic structures and the prioritisation of governance outcomes it closes down spaces for learning for the wide diversity of members. The article argues for the design of spaces for learning by emphasising that diversity of perceptions is crucial for a better understanding of the wicked sustainability challenges.

AB  - The current article explores the integrative dimension of culture within the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) at the European level while fostering cultural stakeholders' empowerment. As sustainable development is an international priority, the interest in the significance of the cultural sector to the transformative process towards sustainable development has risen. The dominant explanation for this trend is given by the crosscutting dimension of the cultural field and its premises to connect the three pillars of sustainable development: social, economic and environmental. The article supports this connection by using data from semi-structured interviews with representatives of ten organisations active in the cultural field from Belgium, Greece, France, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Spain and Hungary. The research findings show the relevance of the cultural sector as enabling sustainable development through its transversal dimension. The results are directed towards facilitating better understanding and increased attention to the benefits of trans-sectorial cooperation between grassroots, research and decision-making actors as a contributive approach to the SDGs.

AB  - Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investments have their rewards and risks. As the world focuses on ESG investments, the media shed light on ESG controversies or concerns, such as tax frauds and harmful products. These controversies place companies at risk and consequently harm their sustainable development. Using a unique supply chain dataset from McDonald's Corporation, this study (i) develops a two-stage efficiency evaluation framework with a metafrontier range directional model in data envelopment analysis (DEA) and (ii) examines the relationship between DEA efficiency scores and ESG and ESG controversy scores through regression analysis. Results show that research and development efficiency (0.910) contributes more to overall efficiency than to profitability efficiency (0.700). While ESG scores positively impact efficiency, ESG controversies exert a negative effect, except for companies with ISO14000 environmental management certification. This study not only reinforces stakeholder theory by highlighting the critical role of ESG practices in enhancing company efficiency and stakeholder engagement but also provides actionable insights for policymakers and management teams to foster sustainable development through strategic ESG investments and partnerships. Overall, this study underscores the importance of examining stakeholder engagement in achieving sustainable development goals by managing financial and R&D resources, investing in ESG, and addressing ESG controversies among supply chains.

AB  - This study documents variation in engineering academics conceptions of sustainability. We investigated how a group of Australian engineering academics described environmental, social and economic sustainability, and identified a broad range of actions that participating academics associated with achieving sustainability. The study suggested marked variation in the actions that participating academics viewed as coherent with sustainable engineering practice, and therefore, potentially marked variations in the sustainability actions academics might advocate to their undergraduate students. Rather than framing this variation as problematic for teaching and learning sustainable engineering, we suggest that such variation in conception of sustainability, and explicit contestation of this variation in the engineering classroom, offers opportunities to enrich undergraduate sustainability learning and teaching. We develop this argument by using some generic environmental, economic, and social theoretical frameworks to characterize the differences according to the values and assumptions that may underpin the observed variation. Validated frameworks are useful to move beyond discussions based on 'opinion', because they provide a framework for critical reflection by engineering students and academics about the values and assumptions that inform engineering practice generally and sustainable engineering practice, particularly.

AB  - Competing water demands for household consumption as well as the production of food, energy, and other uses pose challenges for water supply and sustainable development in many parts of the world. Designing creative strategies and learning processes for sustainable water governance is thus of prime importance. While this need is uncontested, suitable approaches still have to be found. In this article we present and evaluate a conceptual approach to scenario building aimed at transdisciplinary learning for sustainable water governance. The approach combines normative, explorative, and participatory scenario elements. This combination allows for adequate consideration of stakeholders' and scientists' systems, target, and transformation knowledge. Application of the approach in the MontanAqua project in the Swiss Alps confirmed its high potential for co-producing new knowledge and establishing a meaningful and deliberative dialogue between all actors involved. The iterative and combined approach ensured that stakeholders' knowledge was adequately captured, fed into scientific analysis, and brought back to stakeholders in several cycles, thereby facilitating learning and co-production of new knowledge relevant for both stakeholders and scientists. However, the approach also revealed a number of constraints, including the enormous flexibility required of stakeholders and scientists in order for them to truly engage in the co-production of new knowledge. Overall, the study showed that shifts from strategic to communicative action are possible in an environment of mutual trust. This ultimately depends on creating conditions of interaction that place scientists' and stakeholders' knowledge on an equal footing.

AB  - Finding pathways to enable values-for-sustainability transformation is crucial. Despite the emergence of strategic insights and theoretical frameworks like the Four Perspectives, there remains a scarcity of empirical work to directly engage with values for pragmatic learning. We address this gap by presenting an empirical case study of an intervention designed to move two groups from non-collaborative to collaborative on the basis of newly found shared values. By conceptualizing values as tacit knowledge and employing the Knowledge Creation Theory, our intervention facilitated the development of cross-group shared values through Externalization and Combination modes. Our results demonstrate empirical evidence of values-engagement processes including Surfacing and Negotiation from Four Perspectives (i.e. Surfacing values, Negotiating values, Eliciting values, Transforming through values), and informs their sequence of appearance. We highlight the importance of a pool of shared experiences as basis for Surfacing, and demonstrate the utility of the SECI (Socialization, Externalization, Combination, Internalization) model to plan the utilization and sequencing of values-engagement processes towards achieving sustainability transformations. The findings suggest that starting with participants having shared experiences facilitates Surfacing and Negotiation of values, and enables developments of cross-group collaboration valuable for providing preparedness for a diversity of sustainability transformation contexts.

AB  - In determining the importance of fisheries sustainability indicators, stakeholders' interest plays a defining role in the fisheries management practices. The indicator based tools such as RAFFISH have been available for sustainability assessment of fishery resources. In the present study, procedures to validate the pre-selected RAFFISH, which is a multidisciplinary indicator based evaluation tool for measuring the sustainability of fishery resources, are applied. The sustainability indicators were subjected to validation process based on feedback from resource owners, users and experts, using Multi-Criteria Analyses such as Weighted Sum Model and Analytic Hierarchy Process. Based on the validation results, suggestions have been made to improve methodology and its effective application in practice. This paper demonstrates RAPFISH as a potentially effective multidisciplinary tool for evaluation of sustainability of fishery resources. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - To enhance sustainable land use, a From Farmer to Farmer project was conducted in Switzerland (2001-2010). A multi-stakeholder discussion group co-produced nine videos with experienced farmers and wine producers showing sustainable soil management practices. We analysed the video audio-visual content and drew on reflections of the co-production process, referring to concepts of system, target and transformation knowledge, as well as on social learning. The analysis showed a broad range of means (or actions) for sustainable soil management in arable land management, fodder production and wine growing that are aligned to transformation knowledge. The research showed that farmers refer to three phases of social learning, light-bulb moments, coping with challenges and gaining successful expertise. These are not just linear processes of individuals. Four types of social learning were found in the video analysis: (a) learning from observing actions of others, (b) sharing experiences with storytelling, (c) informal social interactions and (d) being a role model with a large social network. Videos enable transformation knowledge to be shared with peers using storytelling; this powerful narrative communication style provides credibility and respects the 'thought style' of the target audience group. We conclude that for successful implementation of sustainable actions, it is important to address a specific target group and share their transformation knowledge built upon system and target knowledge. The social learning video method is a viable way to enable social learning between science, administration and practice and has potential for fostering change in sustainable soil management.

AB  - The paper offers a theoretical advancement on sustainable port development strategies adopting a relational perspective, emphasizing the importance of collaboration and stakeholder interaction in achieving sustainable value creation. It provides a comprehensive overview of the concept of value creation, highlighting its evolution and the different perspectives of analysis in business model research: the conventional value creation perspective, where customers and suppliers are considered key stakeholders in the supply chain, and the sustainability-oriented one, which extends value creation processes to other stakeholders, such as civil society, policy makers, financial stakeholders, and employees. Based on the main gaps of the literature review and drawing on the previous progress on the sustainable business model, this paper develops a theoretical framework, which structures the relationships between the port business operator and its stakeholders at two interconnected levels: the supply chain and the institutional environment. These levels identify core value creation activities and resources, relational governance models, and the value created with and for different stakeholders. However, its implementation opens new avenues for future research that are currently lacking in port research.

AB  - The issue of sustainability is a vital long-term goal for organizations and as such has formed the basis of much academic research over the last two decades. Organizational sustainability is defined as the ability for an organization to accomplish a range of economic, environmental, and human performance objectives. As one of the most studied topics in organizational science, employee engagement at work is seen as a critical component to achieving sustainable organizational success. In order to better understand the employee engagement discourse, this study examined the keywords that appear in the titles and abstract of the employee engagement research domain using the burst detection and social network analysis techniques. A total of 1406 employee engagement relevant articles that were published from 1990 to 2015 were included and investigated in the study. The results revealed the fading, emerging, and central themes within the employee engagement domain.

AB  - Background Transforming the culture of STEM higher education to be more inclusive and help more students reach STEM careers is challenging. Herein, we describe a new model for STEM higher education transformation, the Sustainable, Transformative Engagement across a Multi-Institution/Multidisciplinary STEM, (STEM)(2), "STEM-squared", Network. The Network embraces a pathways model, as opposed to a pipeline model, to STEM career entry. It is founded upon three strong theoretical frameworks: Communities of Transformation, systems design for organizational change, and emergent outcomes for the diffusion of innovations in STEM education. Currently composed of five institutions-three private 4-year universities and two public community colleges-the Network capitalizes on the close geographic proximity and shared student demographics to effect change across the classroom, disciplinary, institutional, and inter-institutional levels. Results The (STEM)(2) Network has increased the extent to which participants feel empowered to be change agents for STEM higher education reform and has increased collaboration across disciplines and institutions. Participants were motivated to join the Network to improve STEM education, to improve the transfer student experience, to collaborate with colleagues across disciplines and institutions, and because they respected the leadership team. Participants continue to engage in the Network because of the collaborations created, opportunities for professional growth, opportunities to improve STEM education, and a sense that the Network is functioning as intended. Conclusion The goal to increase the number and diversity of people entering STEM careers is predicated on transforming the STEM higher education system to embrace a pathways model to a STEM career. The (STEM)(2) Network is achieving this by empowering faculty to transform the system from the inside. While the systemic transformation of STEM higher education is challenging, the (STEM)(2) Network directly addresses those challenges by bridging disciplinary and institutional silos and leveraging the reward structure of the current system to support faculty as they work to transform this very system.

AB  - Interdisciplinary education and education for sustainable development provide a complementary approach to enhancing learners' interdisciplinary and sustainability competencies. An interdisciplinary approach is considered a crucial method for enhancing university students' competencies in sustainability. However, the use of integrating sustainability issues for the purpose of enhancing interdisciplinary education in universities is still under investigation. In contrast to the analyses of sustainability studies programs, this case study explores how sustainability issues could enhance interdisciplinarity in teaching and learning in non-environmentally related courses that do not have special learning objectives related to sustainability. By borrowing Biggs' comprehensive model of teaching and learning in higher education, this case study analyzes an undergraduate general education course and a postgraduate course at a comprehensive research university in Japan from four perspectives: students' perspectives learning environment, learning process, and learning outcomes. This qualitative case study data were collected through mixed research methods, including questionnaires and semi-structured interviews with instructors and learners. Findings demonstrate that interdisciplinary teaching and learning can be enhanced by integrating sustainability issues into non-environmentally related courses. By integrating sustainability issues into the curriculum, students and instructors from various disciplines can collaborate with the intention of enhancing students' abilities to integrate knowledge and communicate with people from different backgrounds and experiences. The paper concludes by discussing the achievements of and barriers to incorporating sustainability themes into interdisciplinary teaching and learning in non-environmentally related courses at universities. Moreover, it provides implications of utilizing a complementary relationship between sustainability and interdisciplinarity to innovate and rethink teaching and learning in higher education to prepare students to build a sustainable future.

AB  - Purpose This study examines the stakeholder perception of the sustainability risks, challenges and benefits arising from managing these risks in the Singapore construction industry. Design/methodology/approach A questionnaire consisting of 89 risk factors, challenges and benefits, was administered, with 216 responses received from various stakeholders. Regression analyses were used to estimate the relationships between sustainability and business risk factors, challenges and benefits associated with business sustainability practices. Findings Stakeholders recognise the importance of the emerging sustainability risk factors, and indeed rank these almost on a par with conventional business risk factors. The inherent business risks determine the nature of sustainability risk factors for construction firms, which in turn can affect their business risks and the performance and value creation of firms. However, most stakeholders, while acknowledging that business sustainability practices can provide benefits as well as posing challenges, do not believe that they can derive net benefits from such practices. Research limitations/implications Through this perception study, there is an urgent need to turn the existing awareness of the importance of business sustainability (BS) practices into more consistent and solid actions among construction firms in Singapore. Practical implications This study's results imply construction firms to incorporate BS practices more systematically into their business strategies and operations, and to include sustainability risk factors alongside conventional business risks in their risk registers and risk management frameworks. Originality/value This study consolidates various variables and constructs of BS matters in the literature and practice into a meaningful framework for the management of BS in the construction industry.

AB  - The widespread disconnect between scientific projections of climate change and the implementation of responsive management actions has escalated calls for knowledge production processes able to exercise a stronger voice in decision making. Recently, the concept of coproduction has been championed as a potential answer. The term 'knowledge coproduction' is used loosely in the literature to describe an inclusive, iterative approach to creating new information; it is distinguished by its focus on facilitating interactions between stakeholders to develop an integrated or transformational understanding of a sustainability problem. Whether a coproduction process is successful in this integration of science and policy depends on a range of capabilities that should be understood as 'coproductive capacities.' We draw on the literature from sustainability science to propose a conceptual framework that specifies the sequential goals of knowledge coproduction and potential sources of coproductive capacity. We apply this framework to examine our experience facilitating the coproduction of a climate change action plan for Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument and World Heritage Site. This framework offers a structure for systematically investigating the capacities, mechanisms, and dynamics of knowledge coproduction and for guiding the design of coproduction processes.

AB  - Despite increasing efforts by research and policy to approach sustainability, human impact on nonhuman nature is intensifying the current social-ecological crisis. To foster sustainability transformation, there is a need to re-think qualities of human-nature connections which calls for relational discourses that provide alternatives to the predominance of mindsets postulating a human-nature divide. Against this backdrop, this conceptual paper introduces 'human-nature resonance' as a relational account that provides system, target, and transformation knowledge for sustainability transformation. The paper argues that the social-ecological crisis has one of its root causes in mute human-nature relations. On this basis, it is illustrated how the social-ecological crisis is only slightly affecting the behaviours of Western societies, which are subsequently failing to establish responsive human-nature relations. Considering that mute relations are fostered by making the world constantly available, the non-affective human-nature relation can be traced back to a lack of material and moral boundaries of nonhuman nature perceived as a lifeless object of infinite availability. For strengthening human-nature resonance, the paper calls for the vision of human-nature partnership neglecting hierarchical human-nature relations. To strengthen the human-nature partnership, nature will speak with an own voice by assigning her legal personhood, agency, and soulfulness. Furthermore, human self-efficacy needs to be strengthened to listen to nature by nourishing internal relational capacities such as compassion and self-worth. Future work on human-nature resonance can integrate basic and applied inter- and transdisciplinary research which links natural and social sciences, Western and Indigenous ontologies, and the scientific world of logos and transcendental wisdom.

AB  - Given China's ecological priority principle of nature reserve development, reconciling rural livelihood and ecological conservation is challenging. Although the closure of small hydropower in the nature reserve is an absolute necessity, a minimum requirement for its success is the active participation of local communities. Due to the remote location and historical reasons, some communities in giant panda nature reserves still depend highly on small hydropower for living. There is little guidance on how these vulnerable communities experience the closure of small hydropower and how these grass-root voices could contribute to the local adaptation plan. Hence, a case study using exploratory participatory scenarios analysis in Wawushan giant panda nature reserve was conducted to explore local adaptation strategies. The scenario-building process brought out four possible but diverse future development options and reflected local stakeholders' corresponding beliefs regarding their adaptation strategies. The study further provided insights into underlying policy options and highlighted the importance of engagement and knowledge exchange between stakeholders to achieve better collaboration and reciprocity for the sustainable development of nature reserves.

AB  - Despite its potential benefits, telemedicine across borders in Europe is still in its early stages and little has been written about these collaborations. This paper aims to explore the factors, which have supported the implementation of a cross-border teleneuromonitoring collaboration between hospitals in the Netherlands, Germany and Switzerland. Semi-structured interviews with key actors were recorded and fully transcribed, and were analysed using framework analysis. Our results indicated that an array of factors facilitated collaboration in telemonitoring and assured its success and sustainability: (1) a real need to initiate the collaboration, (2) real benefits for all the parties involved, (3) agreed protocols and procedures from the start to overcome differences in healthcare systems, (4) two driving forces to sustain the collaboration; a quest for improved quality of care and for innovation, and (5) recognition that this is a bottom-up collaboration initiated by health care professionals who trusted each other.

AB  - IntroductionSuccess with highly active antiretroviral therapy (ART) for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in developing countries has been attributed to collaborative North-South resource-sharing and capacity-building. Academic research and training programmes have contributed towards policy entrepreneurship in a manner that influenced capacity-building within health systems. However, the documented capacity-building frameworks rarely elucidate how such programmes can be designed and implemented efficiently and sustainably.MethodWe implemented the University of Zimbabwe (UZ)-State University of New York at Buffalo (UB) collaborative HIV clinical pharmacology capacity-building programme in Zimbabwe in 1998. We intuitively operationalized the programme around a mnemonic acronym, "RSTUVW", which spells out a supportive framework consisting of "room (space), skills, tools (equipment)", underpinned by a set of core values, "understanding, voice (clout) and will". Subsequent to our two decades of successful collaborative experience, we tested the general validity and applicability of the framework within a prospective programme aimed at expanding the role of health professionals.Results and conclusionBased on this collaborative North-South research and training capacity-building programme which has been positively validated in Zimbabwe, we propose this novel mnemonic acronym-based framework as an extra tool to guide sustainable capacity-building through collaborative North-South implementation research. Its extended use could also include assessment and evaluation of health systems within resource-constrained settings.

AB  - The objective of the study is to examine the effects of artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) and routes towards sustainable development (SD) for a low-profile mining community in Ghana. The study drew on the literature on mining, sustainable development, and the Natural Resource Curse (NRC) theory. Data were gathered using semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions with 203 participants selected through the purposive and snowball sampling methods. The data were analysed using the thematic approach. The findings indicate that although ASGM supported livelihoods through employment and income generation, it had numerous negative effects that weakened the 'pillars' of SD, namely social, economic, and environmental sustainability. Among others, the study reveals conflicts, drop-out and absenteeism among students andpupils, drug abuse, teenage pregnancies, child labour, and violence in the host community. Economically, ASGM affected agricultural production and food security following the destruction of farms and farmlands, while labour and capital were moved from farming to mining. Environmentally, air and water bodies were polluted, flora and fauna destroyed, and productive lands degraded. In short, the SD costs were perceived to be greater than the benefits, lending credence to the NRC theory. Several of these adverse effects were due to the fact that the activities were neither formalized nor regulated. Besides, the operations were characterized by inappropriate technology and lack of geological data, leading to unsustainable mining practices resulting in anti-development outcomes. By way of routes towards sustainability, it is recommended that the operations be formalized under the existing Community Mining Scheme and regulated to ensure responsible, accountable, and sustainable mining. The Scheme should be strengthened in order to drive positive impact-making mining operations by means of introducing a sustainability-oriented licensing regime, sustainable mining technologies, access to land and geological data, stakeholder participation, capacity building on sustainable mining literacy, and eco-friendly mine closure strategies.

AB  - This paper presents the current position and role of the University of Maribor (UM) in linking stakeholders, in order to achieve sustainable regional development. A strategic approach is proposed for facilitating collaboration of the UM with regional development agencies, the local community and industry, based on collaborative learning and development. Furthermore, elements contributing to a successful learning partnership are identified together with the barriers. The results show that regional stakeholders (university, municipality, NGOs, and companies) are commonly engaged in a sustainable regional development, but their activities are not sufficiently linked. The strategic approach, and collaborative learning have led to many on-going SD projects within the University of Maribor. Room for improvement exists, regarding external university collaboration, especially in the fields of research, knowledge transfer, technological development, dissemination of information, education, and innovations.

AB  - In transformative sustainability science, reflexivity is considered critical for ethically sound and socially relevant research. In practice, many transdisciplinary knowledge co-production processes have faced problems in mitigating power hierarchies among the participating actors and the different types of knowledge. In this paper, we develop and test a reflexive framework that enables transdisciplinary researchers to convey more explicitly how their methodological choices play a role in im/balancing power relations in knowledge co-production. The reflexive framework allows researchers to distinguish the different types of knowledge co-produced by the methods, as well as tracking the movements between them. We utilize the framework to reflect upon the methodological choices made through the application of three different transformative methods, namely the Transition Arena, Theory of Change, and Participatory Food Sustainability Assessment and Transformation Framework in different contexts. The results illuminate how the agility between the knowledge types is critical for navigating tensions in power imbalances, as well as producing transformative knowledge. Moreover, the results call further attention to the co-production of critical knowledge in sustainability science.

AB  - The diversity of local conditions across regions has led to numerous challenges and opportunities for the implementation of global sustainability frameworks such as the Sustainable Development Goals. A grassroots transformative change led by local communities, cities, and businesses can offer a promising approach for achieving sustainability, tailored to the unique conditions of each context. Drawing on a systematic review of scientific and policy experiences, we explore some of the major challenges in local sustainability such as disagreements on local priorities, competing interests among various cohorts of stakeholders, and the risks posed by future uncertainties. We propose a transdisciplinary agenda based on the effective integration of computational approaches with genuine stakeholder engagement to mitigate these challenges. The proposed agenda is crucial for mobilizing collaborative efforts that enhance co-learning between scientists and stakeholders in the pursuit of sustainability across scales.

AB  - This research paper aims at developing and applying a constructive weighting methodology for the elicitation of local stakeholders' preferences regarding a set of sustainability evaluation criteria during the assessment of low-carbon energy technologies. The overall methodology has been applied and tested for the sustainability evaluation of selected low-carbon energy technologies in Europe from a local stakeholders' perspective. The researchers applied a constructive weighting methodology based on different Multiple Criteria Analysis (MCA) techniques to test the consistency of stakeholders' preferences. The methodology was piloted based on a small-scale European local stakeholders' survey within the framework of Covenant CapaCITY, an Intelligent Energy Europe project that supports the development of Sustainable Energy Action Plans (SEAPs). It became evident that the local stakeholders who participated placed high priorities on aspects such as CO(2)eq emissions reduction, ecosystem damages reduction, and resilience to climate change during the evaluation of low-carbon energy technologies. Considering the overall energy technologies assessment, wind off-shore, solar PV, hydropower, and wind on-shore achieved the highest scores and better reflected the priorities of local stakeholders considering a large set of multiple sustainability criteria. The high number of criteria led to some inconsistencies of stakeholders' preferences, confirming the need for consistency checks and/or combining different methods of preference elicitation.

AB  - The rapid digital transformation in the public healthcare sector demands effective digital leadership to improve organizational performance. This study investigates the impact of digital leadership on employee empowerment and its subsequent effects on techno-work engagement and sustainability performance within public healthcare institutions in Pakistan. A survey-cum questionnaire method was employed for 334 respondents of employees of public healthcare institutions in the Punjab Province of Pakistan. It used structured questionnaires to measure digital leadership, sense of empowerment, techno-work engagement, and sustainability performance. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was performed on data to examine the proposed relationships among the variables. The findings of SEM showed that digital leadership positively influences employees' sense of empowerment. Empowerment significantly predicted techno-work engagement and sustainability performance. Techno-work engagement also positively affected sustainability performance. Mediation analysis revealed that the sense of empowerment mediates the relationship between digital leadership and both techno-work engagement and sustainability performance. The findings demonstrate that digital leadership enhances employee empowerment, which in turn boosts techno-work engagement and sustainability performance in the public healthcare sector. Organizations should promote digital leadership practices to empower employees and achieve sustainable outcomes.

AB  - Sustainable development is vital for achieving balanced progress across the economic, environmental, and health domains, and it is closely tied to the global drive for addressing climate change and environmental challenges. In this context, reaching the "Dual-Carbon" targets-carbon peaking and carbon neutrality-have become critical priorities both domestically and internationally. As a result, the cultivation of Dual-Carbon professionals is essential for driving sustainable development. This paper investigates the sustainable development capacity of Dual-Carbon professionals through an empirical study of 613 undergraduates in China utilizing Astin's I-E-O theoretical model. This research examines the impact of course experience, self-efficacy, and learning engagement on sustainable development capacity. The results demonstrate that the course experience has a significant positive direct effect on sustainable development capacity. Moreover, self-efficacy mediates the relationship between the course experience and sustainable development capacity, while both self-efficacy and learning engagement serve as chain mediators. Based on these findings, this paper offers practical strategies to enhance the sustainable development capacity of Dual-Carbon undergraduates, providing valuable insights for the education and training of future Dual-Carbon professionals.

AB  - Cooperative Research Centres (CRCs) in Australia are underpinned by funding from the Australian Government. Among their many goals, they are intended to lead to long-term sustainable relationships between industry and academic institutions without the need for further public funding. Yet concerns have been raised in various reports and reviews about the ability of CRCs to achieve sustainable collaboration beyond their initial seven-year life, despite the general observation that CRCs have proved beneficial to the broader Australian community and the economy in general. This study adduces Transaction Cost Theory to determine the impediments to long-term sustainable collaboration between industry and academia. It does so by examining relationships between CRC members at a member organisational level, rather than at an individual researcher or program level, as previous studies have done. The article concludes by introducing testable governance attributes that have the potential to minimise transaction costs between participants in industry-academic collaboration and therefore foster long-term research collaborations.

AB  - While multi-stakeholder engagement is critical to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), there is less understanding in the literature about how the private sector can enhance such engagement at an institutional level. In this study, we examine the case of LG Electronics (LGE), one of South Korea's most sustainable firms. This case study highlights the key strategies that LGE employed in engaging stakeholders for the SDGs, with a focus on stakeholder scope and engagement over three phases: (1) stakeholder communication; (2) stakeholder involvement; and (3) stakeholder engagement. In addition, this paper emphasizes governance mechanisms that facilitated more effective stakeholder engagement, including the company's Corporate Sustainability Management (CSM) strategies, CSR Committee and Sustainability Management Council. These findings also highlight the usefulness of the common language provided by the SDGs in stakeholder engagement and provide practical implications for the private sector in contributing to the shared global agenda.

AB  - Selecting the most appropriate components for a blended learning course is a multifaceted challenge influenced by various criteria. The impact of these influential criteria on the design process is not always obvious. The aim of this study is to assist academics in designing sustainable and engaging blended courses by investigating the impact of these criteria on the selection of blended learning components. By selecting the right mix of components, academics can foster a sustainable and meaningful involvement of students in their learning process over time, ensuring that students' engagement is both enduring and beneficial in achieving academic success. A modified Delphi survey was utilized in this study, involving the participation of eighteen experts experienced in instructional design and online teaching. The analysis primarily relied on quantitative methods, utilizing the mean (to indicate central tendency) and standard deviation (to measure dispersion) for presenting the experts' responses. Additionally, qualitative analysis of experts' comments provided deeper insights into their quantitative ratings. Findings indicate that face-to-face collaborative activities should be the preferred method of delivery for academics aiming to enhance students' engagement and foster their higher-order thinking skills, which students often find challenging. However, this approach is most effective when the group size is manageable. For larger student groups, online collaborative work can be a suitable alternative, provided there is ample online resource support. The results also indicate that online self-paced learning can be advantageous for lower-order thinking learning outcomes, particularly in situations where teaching staff is limited.

AB  - Participatory action research across food value chains (FVC) can help stabilise the food security of subsistence farmers by implementing upgrading strategies (UPS). These strategies can be assessed ex-ante and ex-post for their potential social, ecological and economic sustainability impacts.
   UPS implementation, however, often entails gender-specific changes and challenges in a farmer's social life, economy and environment that either were not perceived and anticipated beforehand or are not followed up during UPS implementation. Before and during their implementation, therefore, UPS need to be entirely understood and assessed by both genders in terms of their potential social, ecological and economic sustainability impacts.
   This article conceptualises a systematic framework for integrating gender in sustainability impact assessments and presents gender-based assessment differences in three low-input UPS in Tanzanian FVC. We conducted ex ante and ex-post impact assessments using nine food security criteria developed earlier by the authors following the Framework of Participatory Impact Assessment (FoPIA). Sustainability impact assessments to a greater extent than expected differed to various extents between the genders for a) different food security criteria, b) different sustainability dimensions (economic, social, and environmental), c) different points in time (TO, T1) of assessments, d) different implemented UPS, and e) different members within the groups of female and/or male stakeholders.
   The results demonstrate the substantial importance of integrating female-male segregated assessments and perceptions before and while implementing food-securing UPS. We anticipate that integrating these assessments and perceptions as regular components will lead to better gendered social learning for both scientists and stakeholders and a holistic understanding of complex local food systems.

AB  - Sustainable infrastructure development is an indispensable driving force for successfully advancing urbanization globally. Evaluation of Infrastructure Sustainability (IS) has become an area of research increasingly gaining scrutiny. However, there exists a knowledge gap of a formal and comprehensive metric system measuring IS in current studies. By reviewing infrastructure assessment studies and international rating systems, this study identified 64 metrics measuring IS. Building upon this, an empirical survey was designed and conducted to propose an IS metric system by analyzing 68 responding samples adopting ranking analysis and confirmatory factor analysis. This IS metric system consists of 4 measurement dimensions integrating the triple bottom line - environmental IS, social IS, and economic IS - with a fourth sustainability pillar of managerial IS. Three case studies evaluating sustainable infrastructures in Hong Kong were conducted to validate the formality and comprehensiveness of the developed IS metric system. It is claimed that, on the one hand, the IS metric system is formal enough to accommodate 4 dimensions, 15 criteria, and 50 metrics required for lifecycle IS evaluation. On the other hand, it is comprehensive enough to distinguish heterogeneous IS criteria adopted by multidisciplinary professionals in IS evaluation. The IS metric system not only contributes to the knowledge and practice in the field of multidisciplinary sustainability evaluation but also serves as a guide for infrastructure stakeholders making multidisciplinary decisions in terms of sustainable infrastructure developments.

AB  - This article outlines the potential of complexity theory as a framework for understanding collaborative project networks and their sustainability within cross-institutional funded projects, responding to funders' interest in projects that deliver public value. Preliminary analysis from an educational project suggests that complexity thinking may be useful also in examining attributes of sustainable networks. The article argues for new measures that shed light on how and why (or why not) collaborative project networks achieve sustainability, removing the current reliance on conventional, linear management and evaluation approaches.

AB  - Knowledge integration is a major challenge of interdisciplinary research. Substantially different stocks of knowledge based on different scientific backgrounds, uses of language, methodologies, and epistemologies must be integrated into the research process. Addressing this challenge, this paper exemplifies the process of interdisciplinary knowledge integration drawing on the example of the junior research group DynaMo-Mobility-Energy Dynamics in Urban Areas that deals with the sustainable transformation of urban mobility systems. This paper shows how we apply the boundary object concept in combination with the method of Constellation Analysis as vehicles for interdisciplinary knowledge integration. By innovatively combining the boundary object concept with Constellation Analysis we (a) suggest a self-reflective tool for structuring the process of knowledge integration and (b) further operationalize the boundary object with the help of core concepts. The approach is illustrated with the boundary object sustainable transformation of urban passenger mobility used by DynaMo. In doing so, the paper aims to add an instrument to the toolkit of inter- and transdisciplinary research and offers practical knowledge for its application.

KW  - Commitment
AB  - Sustainability in higher education has become a prominent global issue. This study examines how Argentina, Spain, and Peru address this topic. Utilizing the participation of Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) in The Impact Ranking (THE- IR) as an indicator of commitment, the behaviors and performances of different HEIs are scrutinized. The objective is to compare the commitment to sustainability among these three countries. The significance of THE-IR lies in its comprehensive evaluation of HEIs' commitment to sustainability, enabling international comparisons. Quantitative methodology allows for the identification of similarities, differences, and best practices in terms of sustainability. Commitment to sustainability is evaluated based on participation in THE-IR. The analysis reveals heterogeneity in commitment among countries, influenced by historical, political, and cultural factors. The implication of this study lies in the need for regulatory frameworks to promote sustainability policies and strategies in university systems. This study enriches the global dialogue on sustainability in higher education, emphasizing the importance of considering national and regional contexts in the development of sustainability policies and strategies in HEIs.

AB  - In public planning processes for sustainable urban development, planners and experts often face the challenge of engaging a public that is not familiar with sustainability principles or does not subscribe to sustainability values. Although there are calls to build the public's sustainability literacy through social learning, such efforts require sufficient time and other resources that are not always available. Alternatively, public participation processes may be realigned with the sustainability literacy the participants possess, and their capacity can modestly be built during the engagement. Asking what tools might successfully align public participation with participants' sustainability literacy, this article describes and evaluates a public participation process in Phoenix, Arizona, in which researchers, in collaboration with city planners, facilitated sustainability conversations as part of an urban development process. The tool employed for Visually Enhanced Sustainability Conversation (VESC) was specifically designed to better align public participation with stakeholders' sustainability literacy. We tested and evaluated VESC through interviews with participants, city planners, and members of the research team, as well as an analysis of project reports. We found that the use of VESC successfully facilitated discussions on pertinent sustainability issues and embedded sustainability objectives into the project reports. We close with recommendations for strengthening tools like VESC for future public engagements.

AB  - This paper examines the results of an evaluation of a training conference in sustainable agriculture for New England extension agents. The results of a survey of participants revealed a polarization among agents in their attitudes and knowledge about sustainable agriculture and participatory learning. These differences in attitudes and knowledge, in turn, had a large effect upon the usefulness and impact of the training. The results indicate that agents with differing attitudes and knowledge have different training needs and that the approach using a single training format for ail agents needs to be reconsidered. It concludes with recommendations to planners of future conferences and suggestions of further research.

AB  - Research that directs the way stakeholders act and how they collaborate is essential when addressing complex environmental challenges in the field of sustainability science. For example, researchers attempting to manage Prosopis invasions through biological control in South Africa have historically faced challenges from stakeholders. In this study, we illustrate the importance of stakeholder engagement and social learning by outlining the collaborative efforts of various stakeholders to promote effective, integrative and sustainable management of Prosopis invasions in the Northern Cape, South Africa. Through a community of practice approach, stakeholders worked together over the past half-decade in an attempt to develop a National Strategy for Prosopis management and improve its control. This strategy aimed not only to emphasise the need for integration of biomass use (aimed at offsetting the costs of mechanical clearing and necessary herbicide use) but also to underscore the significance of biocontrol alongside other management approaches. Stakeholders also identified that adequate farm-scale planning is necessary to provide a sense of purpose and assist in monitoring of progress. We worked alongside land managers and experts to develop such plans. The engagement of local champions played a crucial role in facilitating collaboration and learning among stakeholders, emphasising the significance of inclusive approaches in addressing complex sustainability challenges. In addition, we gained an understanding of how to develop the community of practice to enhance collaboration that ensures the implementation of plans to better manage Prosopis. Our findings underscore the necessity of meaningful stakeholder engagement and collaboration in effective invasive species management. By promoting understanding and involvement of diverse stakeholders, initiatives can have a greater impact in addressing broader sustainability issues. Significance: Our findings highlight the fundamental role of stakeholder collaboration in addressing environmental challenges (e.g. biological invasions), promoting sustainability and fostering social learning. Collaboration facilitates exchange of knowledge, promotes social learning and allows stakeholders to make informed decisions when addressing sustainability issues. Collaborative approaches promote the effectiveness of a community of practice in managing Prosopis invasions in South Africa. Local champions played a pivotal role in facilitating collaboration, bridging communication gaps and promoting inclusive approaches. Sustained stakeholder engagement, transdisciplinary collaborations, effective biological control and market development for biomass products will be essential to improve the sustainable management of Prosopis.

KW  - COLLECTIVE ACTION
AB  - This article analyzes local government fiscal sustainability as a common-pool resource (CPR) problem. Comparing the experiences of Los Angeles County, San Bernardino City, and San Bernardino County, California, the analysis applies a framework developed from three decades of CPR research to show the importance of six micro-situational variables-communications with the full set of participants, known reputations of participants, high marginal per capita return, entry or exit capabilities, longer time horizon, and agreed-upon sanctioning capabilities-in shaping collective action dynamics and building the trust and reciprocity among stakeholders needed to achieve fiscal sustainability. The underlying contextual conditions for these micro-situational variables vary based on specific socioeconomic and political settings, but the findings suggest that institutions and processes can be designed based on several well-tested principles in CPR governance to encourage stakeholders to look beyond their immediate self-interests and make decisions that account for the community's long-term fiscal sustainability.

AB  - This paper aims to explore a research question: what are the drivers and barriers to fostering a creative climate in POGs in China and how to improve POGs towards a better sustainable pedagogy? Theoretically, this paper bridges studies on creativity, collaborative learning, creative climate, and sustainable pedagogy in one framework. Empirically, mixed methods of quantitative questionnaire survey (n = 126) and qualitative interviews (n = 15) were used to collect data. The findings demonstrate that the drivers to a creative climate include the challenge of the task, openness, trust between peers, experts' help, and group diversity, etc. However, some group problems, such as poor management, lacking of supervision supports, and students' fear of authority, etc., are barriers to a creative climate. This implies the needs of restructuring the relationships between teachers and students in POGs in order to improve it as a better sustainable pedagogy.

AB  - Considerable attention is now being given to the role and importance of education and learning implications of participatory resource and environmental governance. The contention is that such learning has the potential to transform behaviour, and in the case of resource management, may help change current patterns in resource use towards a more sustainable social-ecological system. Our purpose is to establish the opportunities for learning afforded to those participating in local level resource management committees in two Cambodian fishing communities and consider the learning outcomes from such opportunities. Our approach was qualitative and used a case study design. The findings establish a wide range of committee resource management activities that resulted in both instrumental (e.g., learning about administrative procedures) and communicative (e.g., insights into the need to conserve mangroves) learning. It was revealed that Such learning can lead to changes in behaviour at the community level (e.g., managing local waste). Our findings also indicated a number of motivators and enablers of learning such as opportunities for dialogue, leadership and the presence of declining resources. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

It heavily relies on communication among varied and interacting stakeholders with shared interests. Thus, it is important to understand how these interactions play a role in forming and sustaining the network. Using the case of a LA in Can Tho province, Vietnam, we analyzed the communication processes generated in the interactions through document analysis of project materials, focus group discussions, key informant interviews with the LA facilitators, and observation notes from eight LA events. Findings reveal that communication underlies network development and maintenance. It facilitated the alignment of stakeholders' interest and reorganization of roles, particularly when stakeholders played an intermediary role in facilitating the LA. The network also explored inclusive strategies to upgrade the rice value chain. However, challenges arose due to communication breakdown related to the strategic positioning of the LA in the broader innovation system. Furthermore, with the network's reliance on the lifespan of bilateral projects led by research institutions, hindered its long-term success. While LA foster negotiated change and inclusivity, more reflections are needed on mechanisms for local uptake, deliberate planning, and enhancement of communication roles to support the learning processes of a LA so that the network can be intentional in pursuing desired change addressing emergent challenges.

AB  - Nowadays, the urban water system is facing many challenges which affect the sustainable development of society. This requires higher education institutions to develop people with a diversity of knowledge and complex problem-solving capacities. This paper presents a practical case of transdisciplinary learning for junior students of environmental design at NingboTech University (Ningbo, China). The course "Environmental Engineering and Technology" ran from 1 March to 24 April 2022. A total of 25 students were instructed in the theories of urban water environmental engineering and then worked in groups to complete a design project for a river ecological restoration. The outcomes were analyzed from the perspective of combining engineering and landscape design. At the end of the course, students volunteered to take an online questionnaire about course evaluation. Students responded highly positively to the course, achieved growth in sustainability literacy, and developed skills in transdisciplinary learning. It also confirms the importance of outdoor education and project-based teaching. Additionally, the lowering of the requirement for mathematical skills through the internet tools usage and the formation of multidisciplinary teams are expected to improve future teaching outcomes. These results provide new insights for educators into the integration of the disciplines between design and engineering.

AB  - Cities worldwide are reorienting their governance and planning practices to negate the negative impacts of urbanisation and seize the opportunities that urbanisation creates through developing capacities for urban sustainability transformations. There has been limited research to date on how urban stakeholders can develop their transformative capacities, especially in the lower-income settings of rapidly developing Southeast Asian countries. In this region, Sihanoukville, Cambodia, has recently experienced a major urban construction boom and has become a city of strategic planning focus for the Cambodian government. To support these efforts, our case study of Sihanoukville city investigates how Sihanoukville can develop the capacities needed to enable sustainability transformation of its sanitation sector. We found Sihanoukville had adaptive capacity but required strengthening of a range of key urban transformative capacities. Sihanoukville city could focus initially on strengthening reflexive and learning practices, knowledge partnerships and collective sustainability visions and goals.

AB  - Biosphere reserves are an example of social-ecological systems that combine biodiversity conservation and socioeconomic development with knowledge generation and dissemination (both scientific and local). We review lessons learned from case studies biosphere reserves in western African and France, highlighting the importance of early stakeholder engagement to build knowledge for achieving sustainable development. We discuss the evolution of the concept of biosphere reserves and its application over time in different socioeconomic and cultural settings. The diversity of stakeholders and their different needs and perceptions about nature conservation complicate implementation processes, sometimes resulting in conflicts about the objectives and zonation of biosphere reserves. Dialogue among the different stakeholders must start at an early planning phase and be based on the principle of social and ecological solidarity. Dialogue must then be pursued, formalized, ritualized, and translated both in terms of biosphere reserve management and in terms of political support. Tools and methods exist that can facilitate such dialogue and colearning.

AB  - Quantifying permafrost carbon feedback (PCF) is a critical step in conveying the significance of permafrost carbon emissions to decision-makers and stakeholders and achieving sustainable development goals. Simply assuming a rapid reduction in permafrost area may be an overaggressive approach. This study revisited PCF by incorporating relatively clear permafrost physics into the Dynamic Integrated model of Climate and the Economy. The results show that the total carbon released from permafrost regions in 2100 is 30.5 GtC, which is accompanied by an additional atmospheric warming of 0.038 degrees C, much lower than previous studies. This study provides a potential perspective to scrutinize the climate feedback and related economic impacts due to permafrost thawing. We may need to pay more attention to carbon processes during nongrowing seasons and sudden changes in permafrost.

TI  - Beyond stakeholder satisfaction: aiming for a new frontier of sustainable stakeholder trust
T2  - TOTAL QUALITY MANAGEMENT & BUSINESS EXCELLENCE
LA  - English
AB  - We live in a period in which management's efforts to satisfy an organization's stakeholders, i.e. customers, employees, shareholders, etc may not be enough for survival or to achieve high performance in the long run. Despite worldwide recognition for excellence, as defined by the markets and/or models for assessing business excellence, several organizations today suffer from the lack of trust and what future revelations will bring. There have been simply too many instances of well-known companies, even as widely rewarded and innovative as Xerox, that could not enjoy the unquestionable support of their stakeholders, because something critical was missing, and that was their previously taken for granted trust. In this paper we examine ways that an organization can achieve the level of trust needed for sustainable excellence. The proposed approach involves the simultaneous improvement of exploring the space of navigating the future and setting a vision and supporting strategic goals, the building of sound relationships among participants in their realization, and the effective relative to goals (and efficient relative to resource utilization) execution of plans in each period. The common denominator in each type of improvement is the development of skills for effective conversations among those within the organization as well as outside stakeholders. The aim for all types of conversation is to go beyond the satisfaction of stakeholders by meeting their needs and expectations-as this goal is limited to specific transactions or time periods. The new challenge for organizations is to reach a new frontier associated with the development of trust among its stakeholders, which makes it possible to endure the hard times, and continually to explore, with success, emerging opportunities.

AB  - In this article, we aim to identify and explore possibilities and challenges of academic interdisciplinary capacities and ethos. The objective is that this knowledge could be used both in future interdisciplinary research projects and in educational settings. We achieve this through self-reflective learning processes among a group of interdisciplinary scholars from four distinctly different subjects. The method used is an autoethnographic and empirical self-reflective approach to data collection, analysis and deconstruction of professional learning processes. This also serves to establish research methodological trustworthiness and authenticity. The results show that interdisciplinarity is undervalued by grant-giving institutions and the academic system, in general. It also entails time-consuming and risky research practices. However, interdisciplinary and collaborative research creates a more innovative and stimulating learning environment and enforces new ways of thinking and doing, in ascertaining each individual's knowledge and competences. We argue that a long-term interdisciplinary and collaborative research process could enhance and raise a critical thinking and creative consciousness among scholars, contributing to a more holistic, sustainable and socially robust learning in research and higher education. Finally, we conclude that this academic interdisciplinary capacity and ethos could be framed and enhanced by the notion of Challenge-Based Learning.

KW  - educational action research
AB  - Scholars regard educational action research as contributing to change and developing sustainable teaching practices. The theoretical framework revolves around the idea that changes stem from human actions and draws inspiration from several philosophical traditions. However, the dynamo of transformation in the different approaches is generally a systematic self-reflective inquiry. In this study, we examine how changes of practice through educational action research emerge when the process is understood through the enactive theory of participatory sense-making. The point of departure for our methodological examination is an action research project on Movement Integration in Danish primary and secondary schools. Our analysis underscores that the process of dialogue and participation in action research gains impact by embracing joint movement-based actions. The study highlights that pre-reflective and movement-based inquiries may be a significant dynamo in the action research project's effort to become deeply meaningful for the participants, to empower their participation and to make sustainable practice transformations possible. Applying the enactive framework in action research brings forward a methodological awareness about unnoticed dimensions of how participants make sense of action research processes, and the significance of being attentive to and working actively with 1) relation-making, i.e. how participants participate in each other's sense-making by how they move in relation to each other; 2) time-making, i.e. how participants' past experiences and future possibilities interblend with how they grasp a given matter; and 3) space-making, i.e. how sense-making is extended into space through the body's location and actions in a given environment.

AB  - In flipped-class pedagogy, students prepare themselves at home before lectures, often by watching short video clips of the course contents. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of flipped classes on motivation and learning strategies in higher education using a controlled, pre- and posttest approach. The same students were followed in a traditional course and in a course in which flipped classes were substituted for part of the traditional lectures. On the basis of the validated Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ), we found that flipped-class pedagogy enhanced the MSLQ components critical thinking, task value, and peer learning. However, the effects of flipped classes were not long-lasting. We therefore propose repeated use of flipped classes in a curriculum to make effects on metacognition and collaborative-learning strategies sustainable.

AB  - This paper specifically outlines an investigation of the influence of sustainability education and study abroad coursework on levels of a key component of academic success, student engagement. A quasi-experimental design compared pretest and posttest levels of engagement (measured by the Deep Learning Scale) among undergraduate students enrolled in four types of courses). Data were analyzed using a repeated measures MANOVA and supported two significant 2-way interactions (Sustainability * Time and Study Abroad * Time) suggesting that student engagement (Deep Learning) is more likely to increase with sustainability (than non-sustainability) courses and with study abroad (than non-study abroad/campus courses). Findings provide empirical support for university initiatives that seek to incorporate sustainability coursework and study abroad opportunities into the undergraduate curriculum as means to enhance students' overall engagement and academic success. The paper provides insights into where sustainability education and study abroad courses have broad potential to promote engagement and, as such, should be considered part of the general learning requirement of university education. In terms of study limitations, the sample is drawn from one university and self-selection bias is possible for students choosing to enroll in study abroad and sustainability-focused courses.

AB  - Wider acceptance of project-based learning (PjBL) in the tertiary education industry has been obstructed by its resource-intensive nature. This paper introduces a transdisciplinary variant of PjBL for undergraduate engineering students through a multidisciplinary complex engineering problem requiring the design and fabrication of a hydraulic robot arm. The robotics-inspired transdisciplinary PjBL variant was first evaluated through student feedback using the Chi-square hypothesis test, which, at Chi-square (4, N = 101) = 129.12; p < 0.05, revealed a statistically significant difference in the proportion of the student feedback in favor of the PjBL for sustainability of transdisciplinary project-based learning. Furthermore, the students' PjBL and PbBL scores were subjected to the Mann-Whitney U test which concluded the effectiveness of PjBL against PbBL with statistical significance, U(N = 101) = 192.00, z = -11.826, p < 0.05. The results indicate that the novel transdisciplinary project-based learning (PjBL) approach develops students' practical engineering knowledge spanning multiple disciplines, thereby resulting in a sustainable concept of project-based learning.

AB  - Over the past few years there has been a growing interface between the fields of sustainability studies and organizational learning, resulting in a n'ew field of inquiry underpinned by the assumption that the learning experiences of organizations in relation to sustainability have cumulatively generated new knowledge and skills to enhance social and environmental responsibility. This paper contributes to the emerging field of sustainability learning by reporting the findings of an exploratory study carried out in Brazil in 2012. Highlighting the critical role of organizational culture in sustainability learning, this study found that the participating organizations did not have formal strategies to promote learning about sustainability. Another contribution is a six-dimensional framework, used in the research, which can foster a better understanding of organizational learning on environmental and social issues.

AB  - A growing number of transformative research practices that redefine the role of science in engaging with local-mostly urban-transformation processes have emerged in recent decades. However, while education is considered a key driver for sustainability transformations, higher education has been slow to develop and implement dedicated, appropriate and effective transformative education programmes and learning modules. In this paper, we present a framework of design principles for transformative learning modules in higher education. These principles are derived from two growing discourses: higher education sustainability learning, and transdisciplinary and transformative research-both of which are centrally anchored in the field of sustainable development and sustainability science. The principles presented provide guidance for course leaders in higher education to create learning modules aimed at enabling students to become engaged in transdisciplinary and transformative research that fosters sustainability transitions in local and urban contexts. We use the Transformative Innovation Lab (TIL)-a learning course developed and tested at two German universities-as an example of how the design principles can be applied. The module, which runs over two semesters, supports Masters students in their process of developing real-world laboratories and exploring urban sustainability transitions through collaborative experimentation with local practice partners. We discuss the factors that enable and limit the implementation of transformative learning modules and outline aspects of the novel roles adopted by lecturers in transformative teaching environments. Moreover, we highlight the need for both institutional change and transformative teaching formats that go beyond transformative research as key for driving universities to take responsibility for collaboratively fostering sustainability transitions in their local contexts.

AB  - Because of its complex, multi-dimensional nature, agricultural sustainability is most often assessed using numerous indicators, which make aggregate comparisons among different production systems difficult. In this paper we propose a methodology that could be beneficial in aggregate sustainability assessment. We apply the method of conjoint analysis to select economic, social, and ecological attributes that are perceived as important for agricultural sustainability by different stakeholders and to assess their relative impact on the overall sustainability measure. Our method presents a flexible framework which could be adopted for a variety of specific applications and allows drawing comparisons among various stakeholder groups based on how they perceive agricultural sustainability.

AB  - Purpose This paper aims to explore the value students place on the sustainable strategies game (SSG) which seeks to improve student engagement in business sustainability through enhanced game-based learning. This game provides an alternative collaborative learning environment to the traditional instructivist approach to enrich Education for Sustainability (EfS) learning experiences and enhance student engagement.
   Design/methodology/approach Students' reflections on their game-based learning experiences and suggestions for game development were collected through a short qualitative survey. Results are explored through three frameworks, namely, the multifaceted student value model, the dimensions of engagement framework and the UK higher education authority (HEA) framework for engagement through partnership.
   Findings Research findings suggest the SSG provides game-based learning within EfS that delivers edutainment within an active, collaborative and experiential learning environment that the students value. It is also able to challenge thinking and emotionally engage students with the fundamentals of business sustainability. Reflection-on-action and the students' role as co-researchers in game development allow students to become active participants in their learning as well as knowledge producers and evaluators. These outcomes deliver the UK HEA's core facets of student engagement through partnership.
   Research limitations/implications This practice-focused study presents the self-reported results of a one-time, small study which does not offer generalised, independently validated responses. However, the findings may be of interest to educators considering the adoption of game-based learning and those seeking new learning cultures for EfS.
   Practical implications Game-based learning and teaching approaches can achieve a learner-centred active, collaborative learning environment that enhances student engagement with business sustainability.
   Originality/value Experiences gained from this study should assist others in the implementation of game-based learning to engage students in business sustainability.

AB  - Sustainability Transition Experiments (STEs), leveraging a transdisciplinary research approach, have recently been proposed as a method to accelerate sustainability transitions. This paper outlines a proposed three-part evaluation framework to assess the process, societal effects, and sustainability transition impacts of STEs. The paper extracts the key insights from multiple literatures, generating a set of indicators to be used in assessing sustainability transition experiments. Particular emphasis is placed on the assessment of longer-term sustainability impacts. We propose a development pathway approach to organize elements of sustainability transition impact into a coherent framework that highlights the inter-relationships between levels of scales in systems transition and foregrounds the role of changes in governance roles and relationships and the role of politics in transitions. The paper offers insights into the challenge of evaluating the sustainability transition impacts of a transdisciplinary research project and provides an important bridge between the evaluation of processes, societal effects, and their link to sustainability transition impacts.

AB  - As life expectancy has increased, a growing number of people experience conditions, including cancers, that carry complex health and social needs. Palliative care services have the potential to address these needs but face significant obstacles. One major obstacle is suboptimal interprofessional collaboration. This study's goal was an in-depth exploration of interactional and organizational barriers and supports of collaboration in palliative care in Switzerland. We sought the perspectives of health care professionals, patients' family members and leaders and experts in oncology/palliative care delivery (key informants) through interviews and focus groups with fifty HPs and key informants and ten patients' family members. Qualitative analyses of interviews and focus groups used framework analysis. We identified three major themes of interaction: personal characteristics, communication, and connectedness with other health care professionals; and three major organizational themes: service characteristics, standardized communication and processes, and service coordination and promotion. Based on our findings, we recommend that health care professionals consider strategies to increase their collaboration and communication skills and opportunities to interact. We advocate the implementation of methods for coordinating services, standardization of consultation/referral procedures and communication between health care professionals, and the promotion of underutilized services to foster successful, sustainable collaboration.

AB  - Forest certification is a practice that has been consolidated worldwide in recent years as a result of certification often being associated with sustainability. However, there is not much research available on the perception of stakeholders and experts of that association. This study evaluates how key stakeholders relate certification to sustainability, and its implications for forest management. A survey was implemented in the eucalyptus plantations of Galicia, northwestern Spain, to assess how forest managers; advisors; environmental organizations; researchers; and members from the FSC (Forest Stewardship Council), PEFC (the Program for Endorsement of Forest Certification), and forest companies and associations, perceive this relationship. The opinions indicate that it should not be assumed that certified plantations are necessarily perceived as the most sustainable ones, that there is always a direct relationship between certification, nor that forest owners and managers certify their woodlands in order to guarantee sustainability. The results also showed that perceptions of certification and sustainability were not influenced by the opinions of different groups of stakeholders.

AB  - The literature has produced relevant theoretical insights into pedagogical frameworks, tools and competences that would be best suited to teach sustainability at higher education (HE). This article contributes to such a discussion using a course on sustainability developed by us as a case study. Two research questions are tackled in this article: (1) How to empower students to address urban sustainability challenges through the inclusion of transformative, interdisciplinary and intercultural learning into the current HE system? (2) Which pedagogical tools can be used to develop students' sustainability-oriented competences? To address the research questions, the case study consists of two parts. First, by reflecting on the course design, this article aims to shed light on the benefits and challenges of transformative pedagogy and of an interdisciplinary and intercultural framework. Second, by analyzing students' learning diaries (N = 36) using thematic analysis, this article offers insights into some of the students' learning process, allowing us to assess the strengths and weaknesses of the course design as well as draw implications to improve and renew courses on sustainability in HE. The findings from the learning diaries indicate the students' thirst for formal knowledge on sustainability, which they connected to their professional development and yearning for action. The learning diaries also suggest students' increasing awareness of sustainability as a systemic and structural issue during the course, which aligns with the transformative learning framework used. Finally, this study emphasizes the need for structural support to meaningfully integrate sustainability in HE curricula and teaching practices.

AB  - Livelihood diversification is essential to food security and improved incomes for human development in African rural communities. Uganda's agrarian economy suffers from limited diversification, environmental degradation, low incomes, and multifaceted negative impacts of AIDS. Efforts to stimulate and support innovation in agricultural production technology, forms of social organization, and poor markets are essential elements in promotion of sustainable rural livelihoods. Iowa State University's Center for Sustainable Rural Livelihoods and its partner organizations are applying a multi-dimensional approach to engage Uganda farmers and rural leaders in community-based learning and capability strengthening. We describe the role played by livelihood diversification and explore the promotion of sustainable livelihoods through scholarship with praxis. Sustainable livelihoods concepts are examined as a means to better understand contemporary African rural development. We identify principles and processes critical to achieving sustainable livelihoods. Their application is highlighted based on our early collaborative experience, including a discussion of the complexities associated with entering into balanced partnerships required for a successful community-based program. We explore the value of social science perspectives and processes for strengthening rural development in developing countries.

AB  - This perspective paper synthesises the special issue 'Human-nature connectedness as a leverage point for sustainability transformation'. Based on the articles in this special issue, we aim to foster the operationalisation of the leverage points perspective to shape human-nature relations to enable sustainability transformations. Specifically, we draw on four key advantages of the leverage points perspective: (i) the explicit recognition of deep leverage points; (ii) the ability to examine the interactions between shallow and deep system changes; (iii) the combination of causal and teleological modes of research; and (iv) the ability to function as a methodological boundary object. The contributions to this special issue revealed three deep leverage points addressing paradigm shifts in research and beyond: relational thinking and values, stewardship philosophy and shifting the economic growth paradigm to focus on human well-being. We highlight interlinkages between leverage points to further strengthen the transformative potential of interventions that aim at triggering shifts in our understanding about human-nature relations. Further, we show a way to bridge causal and teleological approaches by envisioning desired futures. Lastly, we emphasise the potential of arts-based methodologies, including participatory, transdisciplinary research to foster sustainability transformation and how this can be combined within the leverage points perspective.

AB  - This essay examines links, similarities, and dissimilarities between stakeholder theory and sustainability management. Based on the analysis a conceptual framework is developed to increase the applicability and the application of stakeholder theory in sustainability management. Concluding from the analysis, we identify three challenges of managing stakeholder relationships for sustainability: strengthening the particular sustainability interests of stakeholders, creating mutual sustainability interests based on these particular interest, and empowering stakeholders to act as intermediaries for nature and sustainable development. To address these challenges three interrelated mechanisms are suggested: education, regulation, and sustainability-based value creation for stakeholders.

AB  - The need to deal with complexity is getting increasingly attention in research for development projects implemented through transboundary research partnerships between organisations from the Global North and the Global South. However, less is known about aspects beyond the systems under study that still affect complexity in the research project. We conducted an experience capitalization of five transboundary research partnerships undertaking research in 14 countries in the Global South. We found that the combination of multiple contexts, the cultural and disciplinary diversity of the transboundary research partnerships, and the set of rules and proceedings from the funding mechanism affect the levels of complexity. We further identified that a transdisciplinary approach and several related practices, like intercultural communication or integrative partnerships, are promising ways of dealing with complexity. Current structures in research for development need to improve in order to fully use the potential of transdisciplinarity for sustainability transformation.

AB  - Questions related to how we practice sustainability science remain salient in the face of the failure to achieve broad-scale sustainability objectives. Transdisciplinarity is an essential part of sustainability science. Transdisciplinary conceptual scholarship has been more prevalent than empirical scholarship or applications, especially in developing world contexts. In a single case study of a multiyear project addressing water security issues in HaMakuya, South Africa, we used a framework for assessing transdisciplinary objectives to facilitate more systematic learning for those who practice sustainability science. We found that defining the problem and assembling our team were easier than the co-creation of solution-oriented knowledge and the reintegration and application of this new knowledge. Our singular case study speaks to the potential challenges related to building relationships and co-creating knowledge in an epistemologically diverse setting. Other case studies appear to have negotiated these issues in developing country contexts, and this leaves room further investigation for how to practice transdisciplinarity under these conditions.

AB  - This paper describes the integration of geographic information system (GIS) technology in a high school environmental science classroom, specifically examining the impact of GIS technology on student engagement, critical thinking, and interdisciplinary learning for Education for Sustainability (EfS). This environmental science classroom utilized ArcGIS Online and StoryMaps to facilitate hands-on learning, enabling students to explore spatial relationships, analyze data, and communicate insights to foster engagement and critical thinking. This GIS technology promotes interdisciplinary learning by connecting essential environmental issues with location and other social factors. Students deepen their understanding of human-environment interactions by interpreting spatial data, empowering them to propose sustainable solutions to environmental challenges. Using ArcGIS Online and StoryMaps, students engaged in guided lessons, explored sustainability topics, and created their own StoryMaps based on the United Nations' (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The findings highlight positive engagement, critical thinking, and interdisciplinary learning impacts. Students demonstrated increased interest, understanding of complex issues, and developed analytical skills through spatial data analysis. The approach encouraged interdisciplinary thinking and expanded awareness of ongoing environmental challenges, supporting EfS goals.

AB  - Knowledge co-production has become part of an evolution of participatory and transdisciplinary research approaches that are increasingly important for achieving sustainability. To effectively involve the most appropriate stakeholders there is a need for engagement and increasing prominence of stakeholders in environmental management and governance processes. The paper aims at developing and testing a methodology for stratifying stakeholders by (i) classifying organisations involved in coastal and ocean governance by their agency, and (ii) grouping them into organisational archetypes for representation and selection in research processes. Agency was measured by the three dimensions of scale, resources, and power. Each dimension was further elaborated as a set of indicators. The methodology is applied in the context of a research project set in Algoa Bay, South Africa. The stratification of organisations enabled the research team to gain a better understanding of the stakeholder landscape of organisational agency, and thus identify the most relevant stakeholder with which to engage. The use of a hierarchical cluster analysis identified five organisational archetypes in relation to ocean and coastal governance in Algoa Bay. The methodology used in this study proposes an informed and intentional approach to create the conditions under which the co-production of and participation in research processes can take place.

AB  - This study investigates international corporate social responsibility (CSR) in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). While international CSR is key to firm internationalization, hardly any research has been conducted on international CSR in SMEs. Drawing on an interpretive approach, we reveal four distinct understandings of international CSR which entail different CSR practices: international CSR as a driver of international performance; as necessary for international distinctiveness; as a promoter of successful international collaboration; and as a catalyst for change, empowerment, and sustainable internationalization. Our study contributes to the development of the nascent literature on international CSR in SMEs and to stakeholder theory.

AB  - Producing sustainable biodiesel from oil crops has been a great challenge, especially for oil crops plantations that involve various small and medium stakeholders. Differences in plantation activities and environments create a unique sustainability profile for each oil crop that may impose more sustainability issues such as deforestation problems in oil palm plantations. This paper embraced the unique sustainability index profile of each oil crop, and an investigation was performed to evaluate the feasibility of integrating multiple oil crops into the existing biodiesel refinery to improve its economic and sustainability performances. The selection of the process feed is proposed to be based on oil crop properties such as iodine value, peroxide value and saturated and unsaturated fatty acid contents. The sustainability profiles considered in the study include deforestation, oil yield, fertiliser impact, water impact and carbon footprint. Case studies demonstrated that a more balanced sustainability index profile could be achieved at a higher production cost-from USD 6.43 billion center dot y(-1) in a cost-saving-centric solution to USD 39.90 billion center dot y(-1) in a sustainability-improvement-centric solution. The study provided excellent insight into the impact on production cost to achieve sustainability which can help stakeholders to evaluate the feasibility of integrating multiple oil crops in the system.

SCNs have had several provincial successes in improving health outcomes. Little research has been done on the sustainability of these evidence-based implementation efforts. Methods We conducted a qualitative realist evaluation using a case study approach to identify and explain the contextual factors and mechanisms perceived to influence the sustainability of two provincial SCN evidence-based interventions, a delirium intervention for Critical Care and an Appropriate Use of Antipsychotics (AUA) intervention for Senior's Health. The context (C) + mechanism (M) = outcome (O) configurations (CMOcs) heuristic guided our research. Results We conducted thirty realist interviews in two cases and found four important strategies that facilitated sustainability: Learning collaboratives, audit & feedback, the informal leadership role, and patient stories. These strategies triggered certain mechanisms such as sense-making, understanding value and impact of the intervention, empowerment, and motivation that increased the likelihood of sustainability. For example, informal leaders were often hands-on and influential to front-line staff. Learning collaboratives broke down professional and organizational silos and encouraged collective sharing and learning, motivating participants to continue with the intervention. Continual audit-feedback interventions motivated participants to want to perform and improve on a long-term basis, increasing the likelihood of sustainability of the two multi-component interventions. Patient stories demonstrated the interventions' impact on patient outcomes, motivating staff to want to continue doing the intervention, and increasing the likelihood of its sustainability. Conclusions This research contributes to the field of implementation science, providing evidence on key strategies for sustainability and the underlying causal mechanisms of these strategies that increases the likelihood of sustainability. Identifying causal mechanisms provides evidence on the processes by which implementation strategies operate and lead to sustainability. Future work is needed to evaluate the impact of informal leadership, learning collaboratives, audit-feedback, and patient stories as strategies for sustainability, to generate better guidance on planning sustainable improvements with long term impact.

AB  - Higher Education Institutions (HEI) play a significant role to unite diverse stakeholders and carry out planned learning activities that can promote change on both a personal and social level. Transformational research is dependent on the presence of an engaging and valuable problem that participants can make significant contributions in a collaborative manner across disciplines. Transformative learning process facilitates the integration of knowledge across several perspectives. This article explores the dynamic intersection of entrepreneurship and sustainability through the lens of a transformative action research approach in one's teaching practice. A qualitative action research approach is adopted. This research aims to enhance Sustainable Entrepreneurship (SE) as a facilitator at the University and also synthesize insights from lived experiences in Finland, Namibia, Kenya, and South Africa. This article advocates for a transformative paradigm shift, to drive meaningful impact, foster resilience, and catalyse positive change in the pursuit of navigating entrepreneurial sustainable business practices as a facilitator.

AB  - Non-technical summary Scientists often argue that today's efforts towards sustainability in cities call for a strong exchange on knowledge with non-scientific actors. But do urban practitioners think the same way? Do they see the need for scientific support in their work? In our research, we directly asked these questions to urban practitioners. This article evolves around their answers and describes the activities we conducted in order to start the necessary discussion with them. Technical summary Given the challenges cities are facing in their efforts towards sustainability, we scrutinize if urban practitioners believe that scientific knowledge can support them in implementing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and if, how. To find evidence, we conducted a 'co-design' approach in Future Earth in terms of knowledge production, targeting at German cities. In consequence, the aims of this article are twofold. First, we aim at describing the implementation of the co-design process itself as a potentially useful tool for the interaction with urban practitioners and the evaluation of their specific needs. Second, we present the main results of the co-design process and its contribution for SDG implementation in cities. Combining the two aims, we argue for novel research approaches that allow for more collaborative activities as well as for adequate funding opportunities in the light of urban sustainability transformations.

AB  - University reputation is the result of the assessments that the stakeholders make of the university, especially the user of the education service, the student. The literature has shown an important impact of reputation on the student's perception of the university, and it has been related to success, competitiveness, sustainability, stakeholder decision-making and the differential of the value offer. Therefore, its evaluation has been the subject of several studies that seek to measure and assess reputation in higher education to understand how to manage it. This article evaluates the psychometric properties of the reputation scale in students at private universities in Colombia. The methodology used included an adaptation of the scale to the Spanish language, content validity analysis, reliability analysis, exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis. The results showed the validity and reliability of the scale and, through the analyses carried out, provided evidence of the scale's robustness.

LA  - English
KW  - BUSINESS
AB  - This chapter characterises Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) from a German perspective. It examines whether and how the German political and socioeconomic stakeholder response to sustainable development differs from the practices undertaken in other countries. By reviewing its historical development, key influencing factors, and current trends, this qualitative review, based exclusively on secondary data, forms an information basis from which Germany's past CSR choices are critically investigated. The authors reason that the 'recipe' which led to the post-war German success story has paid too much attention to the Washington Consensus and does not reflect how capitalism should ideally work. Recent German scandals have born witness to the clash of shareholders maximising their income, which was done by stealth, while pretending to serve stakeholders and the environment. Germany has traditionally fast followed other countries and now is the time to pioneer again and show that a capitalism conscious of the needs of society is the best way forward. The authors call on Germany to follow the courage of her former social market economy convictions which are better adapted to post-capitalism. Asia's commendable growth rates reveal the merit of this approach. A key premise in this realisation is a mind-set transition in which decision-makers cease making choices from the perspective of the past. The authors conclude that at a corporate response level, Germany could better utilise her unique stakeholder-orientated Mittelstand culture by empowering creative people thereby driving innovative sustainable solutions and ultimately economic growth.

AB  - Fostering sustainable community development and understanding social transformations are crucial topics in sustainability science. A new mode of research, real-world laboratories, are enabling the mutual engagement of science and society towards sustainability through transdisciplinary research. However, recent literature has paid little attention to the establishment of these collaborative research spaces. In our case study, we initiated a transdisciplinary research process in Luneburg (involving participants from university, municipality, nongovernmental organizations and society at large) with the goal of creating a setting for a real-world laboratory. We combined qualitative scenario analysis and visioning. Our findings demonstrated that establishing real-world laboratories in a transdisciplinary process builds trust and commitment among the involved participants and forms a vital starting point for the institutionalization of future transdisciplinary collaboration and research. Therefore, our approach can serve as an impetus for other communities to engage in bottom-up collaboration towards sustainability transformations.

T2  - MANAGEMENT EDUCATION FOR GLOBAL SUSTAINABILITY
LA  - English
KW  - GREEN
AB  - This chapter encourages instructors to engage students in researching and writing their own sustainability cases, thus making 'the case' for and recommending specific action towards achieving sustainability. Personal engagement is shown to ground students' learning in actual organizational, industry, event or issue-based contexts. Students grapple with real-world tensions and challenges. They reflect on the relevance of classroom theory to practice. Examples are used to show how students apply, critique and sometimes even develop theory that yields insight into the situations they are analyzing. Students contribute to enhanced practice by presenting options and/or recommendations for the short, medium and even long term. To be successful, these options must take into account the complexities faced by the owner/managers, industry bodies, event organizers or relevant policy-makers in the case. A powerful learning experience call emerge for both the students and the organizations involved. Guidelines for implementing case-writing as a student learning and assessment exercise are offered.

AB  - PurposeThis study aims to investigate how Living Labs of Van Hall Larenstein UAS perform as sustainability-oriented, transdisciplinary learning environments. It shows how the sustainable development goals (SDGs) can be used as a compass and debates the sustainability impact of applied research.Design/methodology/approachA case study approach was adopted, including a literature review, scoping visits, online workshops and peer-to-peer inter-vision/learning, using the SDGs as a compass and framework for analysis.FindingsMost Living Labs use a "silo-approach" on the SDGs and are designed from a technological-expert perspective. This results in blind spots, particularly on SDGs related to reducing socio-economic inequality and just institutions. Debating unsustainable systems, cultures and practices is avoided. To contribute to sustainability transitions, universities need to invest in developing transformative capacity. This refers to SDG-transition competences such as collaborative communication, constructively engaging with diversity and conflicts, discussing values, norms and ethics and encouraging reflexivity.Research limitations/implicationsMainly lecturer-researchers were involved in the study. COVID-19 travel restrictions hindered the research at the grassroots level in India and Indonesia.Originality/valueThe study revealed the importance of creating Living Labs as safe and brave inter- and transdisciplinary learning environments to practice reflexivity: encouraging students, researchers and stakeholders to look at sustainability issues from plural perspectives and questioning unsustainable practices, which combined lead to changing perceptions, practices and relations and a deeper understanding of how change happens. The SDGs as a compass method supports reflexivity among stakeholders and in redirecting strategies towards a sustainable future.

AB  - This study seeks to explore the relationship between science teachers' computational thinking skills, collaborative learning attitudes, and their creativity in the context of sustainable education. The study adopted an explanatory sequential design, which is one of the designs used in mixed-method research. A total of 369 science teachers were included in the quantitative phase of the study. Quantitative data were collected using three different scales. These scales included the "Computational Thinking Scale", "Online Cooperative Learning Attitude Scale (OCLAS)", and "Creative Self-Efficacy Scale". Structural Equation Modelling (SEM), confirmatory factor analysis, and path analysis were conducted to analyze the quantitative data. The qualitative phase of the study consisted of nine science teachers. Data were collected with a semi-structured interview form by considering the scores obtained from the scales. Qualitative data were analyzed through descriptive analysis. It was found that science teachers' computational thinking skills and collaborative learning attitudes significantly predicted their creativity within the framework of sustainable education. As a result of the interviews conducted, it was concluded that science teachers lacked computational thinking skills. It is critical to provide teachers with guidance on how to integrate computational thinking skills into their subject areas. Science teachers' knowledge of computational thinking skills can be enhanced, and computational thinking skills can be included in all teacher education programs.

AB  - Transdisciplinary research and innovation (R&I) efforts have emerged as a means to address challenges to sustainable transformation. One of the main elements of transdisciplinary efforts is the 'inclusion' of different stakeholders, values and perspectives in participatory R&I processes. In practice, however, 'doing inclusion' raises a number of challenges. In this article, we aim to contribute to re-politicizing inclusion in transdisciplinarity for transformation, by (1) empirically unraveling four key challenges that emerge in the political practice of 'doing inclusion', (2) illustrating how facilitators of inclusion processes perform balancing acts when confronted with these challenges, and (3) reflecting on what the unfolding dynamics suggests about the politics of stakeholder inclusion for societal transformation. In doing so, we analyze the transdisciplinary FIT4FOOD2030 project (2017-2020)-an EU-funded project that aimed to contribute to fostering EU R&I systems' ability to catalyze food system transformation through stakeholder engagement in 25 Living Labs. Based on 3 years of action-research (including interviews, workshops and field observations), we identified four inherent political challenges to 'doing inclusion' in FIT4FOOD2030: (1) the challenge to meaningfully bring together powerful and marginalized stakeholders; (2) combining representation and deliberation of different stakeholder groups; (3) balancing diversities of inclusion with directionalities implied by transformative efforts; and (4) navigating the complexities of establishing boundaries of inclusion processes. We argue that by understanding 'doing inclusion' as a political practice, necessitating specificity about the (normative) ambitions in different inclusion settings, facilitators may better grasp and address challenges in transdisciplinarity for transformation.

AB  - This article presents a pilot project at Hamburg University addressing challenges of social sustainability to students of Psychology, Economics, and Business Administration. Especially developed for teaching sustainability, Interdisciplinary Problem-based Learning (iPBL) is a student-centered pedagogy, combining two different teaching methods: Problem-based Learning and Interdisciplinary Learning. Fostering a multi-perspective approach to highly complex problems like corruption, health inequality, and social inequity, students work in interdisciplinary teams consisting of 8 to 10 members. After reading the problem, they follow 8 steps to identify solution approaches: (1) clarification of terms and concepts throughout the disciplines, (2) formulation of an interdisciplinary problem statement, (3) brainstorming about monodisciplinary theories, models and methods related to the problem, (4) classification and structuring of brainstorming by identifying possible connections and discrepancies throughout the disciplines, (5) formulation of interdisciplinary learning objectives, (6) self-study by reading papers across disciplines, (7) interdisciplinary post-discussion, and (8) formulation of an integrative team statement. In each team, students assign roles (discussion leader, team member and secretary). Additionally, each team is supported by a tutor. While promoting interdisciplinary thinking to develop innovative solutions, iPBL is designed to enhance understanding of and competence in social sustainability.

AB  - Industrialization and urbanization have affected Indonesia's rural communities and farming culture, which were once integral parts of its ecological system. This paper presents a participatory co-design approach based on the local and traditional learning philosophy of niteni to support sustainable development. The participatory co-design approach encouraged collaboration between marginalized communities, government bodies, and a multidisciplinary academic team. Through this lens, interviews, forums, and an ethnographic study were undertaken in order to acquire data and information for idea generation and planning. Firstly, eight niteni themes were identified, including the environment and ecosystems, traditional values and farming culture, crafting skills, manufacturing, and the local economy. Building on an understanding of the challenges associated with each of these themes, we identified future development priorities. A key action identified was the reintroduction of traditional farming, in particular the planting of local rice varieties and the local tradition of Pranatamangsa, which promote human-nature connections such as farming activities and rituals following natural seasonal cycles. Finally, design approaches were used to revive the local rice farming tradition (Rojolele Delanggu), including product branding and packaging designs to support regional identity. The paper concludes that the inclusion of design thinking in a sustainable development strategy based on cultural specificity can increase participation and support traditional indigenous practices and community resiliency.

AB  - Social learning can be seen as a crucial and indispensable condition for successful sustainable development implementation as it is grounded in collective and collaborative learning and supports learning processes associated with relevant socially oriented aims. It is also considered to be a basis for regional cooperation where different stakeholders are brought together to share knowledge and information about sustainable development within a community and enter into a dialog with the lay public. With this in mind, the authors focus their attention on how to build a framework for initiating and successfully continuing participative processes oriented toward enhancing regional sustainability. They analyze models of Regional Sustainability Initiatives (RSI) and Regional Centers of Expertise (RCE) that represent learning platforms for sustainability oriented regional cooperation with the aim of identifying general principles of efficiency and building a system for their assessment based on indicators. The most significant characteristics of social learning processes are identified, and qualitative as well as quantitative indicators are developed and applied to projects gathered together in the LENSUS Database. These indicators are then discussed with regard to social learning principles and the potential interconnectedness of social learning with a society's social capital. The indicators represent a relative measure for the comparison of processes and/or projects in the context of assessment and its specific objectives. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The presented manuscript represents a new simulation modeling approach, which evaluates the impact of collaborative workplaces on manufacturing sustainability in terms of workplaces' cost, flow times and electrical energy consumption. The impact of collaborative workplaces on the manufacturing system and on its sustainable viability as a whole has not yet been explored, despite the fact that collaborative workplaces are increasingly present in different manufacturing systems. In the past, researchers have devoted a lot of time to research individually examining the collaborative machines, workplaces and various aspects of Sustainable Manufacturing. Investigating the impact of collaborative workplaces on an enterprise's financial, social and environmental points of view is a very complex task, since we are talking about a multicriteria evaluation of manufacturing systems. The simulation approach is based on a newly proposed block diagram structure that allows for an evaluation of the impact of collaborative workplaces on Sustainable Manufacturing in its entirety. Using the input data of the real-world manufacturing system characteristics and Eurostat statistical values, numerical and graphical results of the proposed simulation evaluation are given, which, with a high degree of evaluation credibility, influences the introduction of collaborative workplaces in manual workplaces. The results obtained show a 20% reduction in the cost of collaborative workstations compared to manual assembly workstations, a 13.2% reduction in order throughput times, a negligible increase in energy consumption in operation mode of 3.28% and a 4.57% reduction in the idle mode. The new evaluation approach allows for a comprehensive consideration of the influence of the collective workplace when developing new or modernizing existing manufacturing systems from a financial, social and environmental point of view.

AB  - Recently, innovative changes in information technology (IT) trends, such as cloud computing and deep learning, have led IT companies to focus on collaboration for sustainable growth. This paper investigates collaboration strategies and success factors for IT service companies via a survey-based empirical study of Korean leading IT firms. Four types of collaboration were identified by considering the types of customer relationship and the target market: offshore, joint venture, collaboration with small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and partnership with major local firms. Then, based on a Plan-Do-See management activity process, this paper considers success factors in the planning process and collaboration process, and analyzes an impact of these factors on collaboration performance such as financial performance, process innovation, improving competitiveness, and technology acquisition. As a result, the success factors differ according to the types of performance measures as well as the collaboration types. In particular, the characteristics of partners positively influence competitiveness in captive and global markets, while they improve process innovation in open and domestic markets. This study attempts to provide insight for companies in the IT service industry about how collaboration activities could enhance performance, depending on the alliance types.

AB  - This study aims to investigate the mechanisms by which firms' strategic entrepreneurship (SE) impacts the achievement of their collaborative advantage (CA) for sustainable supply chain innovation. It includes a comprehensive analysis of the direct effect of SE on CA, the contingent effects of organizational structure and collaborative networks on this impact and the interaction effect of exploration and exploitation strategies under SE. An integrated conceptual model is proposed and the hypotheses are tested by structural equation modeling (SEM) using survey data from 432 manufacturing firms in China. The results confirm the positive impact of SE on CA, which is moderated differently by decentralized, formalized and specialized organizational structures. Meanwhile, vertical and horizontal collaborations lead to different types of advantages, and firms need to balance exploration and exploitation strategies across functional domains to achieve strategic ambidexterity, which further improves CA and facilitates sustainable supply chain innovation. Theoretically, this study is original in applying SE to the collaborative advantage in a supply chain context, while taking into account the high complexity of supply chain collaboration with a contingency approach. Practically, this study provides important managerial implications and specific recommendations for different firms to achieve sustainability in supply chain collaboration and innovation.

AB  - The achievement of global sustainability agendas, such as the Sustainable Development Goals, relies on transformational change across society, economy, and environment that are co-created in a transdisciplinary exercise by all stakeholders. Within this context, environmental and societal change is increasingly understood and represented via participatory modeling for genuine engagement with multiple collaborators in the modeling process. Despite the diversity of participatory modeling methods to promote engagement and co-creation, it remains uncertain what the extent and modes of participation are in different contexts, and how to select the suitable methods to use in a given situation. Based on a review of available methods and specification of potential contextual requirements, we propose a unifying framework to guide how collaborators of different backgrounds can work together and evaluate the suitability of participatory modeling methods for co-creating sustainability pathways. The evaluation of method suitability promises the integration of concepts and approaches necessary to address the complexities of problems at hand while ensuring robust methodologies based on well-tested evidence and negotiated among participants. Using two illustrative case studies, we demonstrate how to explore and evaluate the choice of methods for participatory modeling in varying contexts. The insights gained can inform creative participatory approaches to pathway development through tailored combinations of methods that best serve the specific sustainability context of particular case studies.

AB  - Public participation in environmental governance is crucial for sustainable development in industrial parks. The present study employs grounded theory to analyze the complete process of public participation in environmental governance within China's S Industrial Park. Specifically, this study investigates the reasons for public's absence in environmental management and identifies the strategies for achieving sustainable and effective participation. We found that lack of institutional guarantee systems and insufficient ability of public hinder public participa-tion, while interest and institutional space motivate public participation. To achieve sustained and effective participation, a multi-stakeholder environmental governance platform is necessary. We also strategies for enhancing participation, including forming mutually beneficial relationship, promoting community organiza-tions, and encouraging information disclosure.

AB  - Background. Careful consideration of an increasingly underprepared tertiary student population, the limited use of simulation in South African (SA) healthcare education and a changing healthcare education milieu is required from SA educators when implementing, evaluating and revising simulation integration.Objectives. To develop a conceptual framework for the integration of simulation in the SA undergraduate physiotherapy programme. Methods. A non-experimental descriptive research design was used. A purposive sample of 15 healthcare educationalists from SA and abroad were approached to participate in a modified Delphi survey, informed by the results obtained from a systematic review identifying simulation integration framework elements. Data were analysed as percentages, with feedback provided to panel members following each round.Results. Data saturation was achieved after round 3, with a response rate of 73.3% (n=11). The main findings suggested that student preparation prior to simulation-based learning experiences (SBLEs) should include orientation to SBLE logistics and expectations (73%), and could include informal assessment of theory (64%). Inclusion of the feedback/debriefing process (82%), methods (100%) and timing (85%) as part of student and educator preparation were also deemed essential. Panel members agreed that programme evaluation in line with stakeholder feedback (92%) is vital for guiding adjustments to the programme that is integrating simulation.Conclusion. The developed conceptual framework indicates the necessity of student and educator preparation to ensure optimal SBLE participation and outcome achievement. Programme sustainability should be ensured through programme evaluation and adjustment, in line with stakeholder feedback, best practice and accrediting professional body guidelines.

AB  - Sustainable tourism indicators assist in fashioning tourism intervention plans with the policy-relevant framework for incorporating sustainability into planning and decision-making, and the success is entwined with the participation of different stakeholders. This work identifies and evaluates tourism sustainability construct indicators in the mountain ecosystems. The present study used both quantitative and qualitative research methods. The delineation of the extent of criteria & indicators was done by extensive literature & stakeholders' interpretation assessments. Delphi Survey with Lawshee's CVR (Content Validation Ratio) was conducted encircling a range of concerned stakeholders to pleat the consensus. Cronbach's Alpha, Content Validity Index, and Modified Kappa were also used to see the internal consistency. The results highlight that out of 106 selected indicators, the consensus was achieved on only 76 indicators after three rounds of the Delphi survey. These retained indicators were validated by CVR scores that were >= 0.33 for all 76 indicators. Cronbach's Alpha, Content Validity Index, and Modified Kappa estimates exceed 0.70, highlighting better results. The work contributes a polished appreciation and significance of stakeholders in the sustainable development of tourism in fragile mountain ecosystems. With the result, it underscores the importance of sustainable tourism indicators for monitoring and managing sustainable tourism development in mountain ecosystems.

AB  - This article explores the multiplex relationships among organizations within the context of emergency management. It examines the role of friendship networks and disaster preparedness networks in predicting sustainable collaborative disaster response networks. Furthermore, it examines the impact of emergency management systems on network building and sustainability. This article applies inferential network analysis methods in analyzing relationships among emergency management networks and examines the predictive power of preestablished network arrangements. This research suggests that friendship networks are important for encouraging organizations to be involved in disaster preparedness networks. Yet it is the collaboration ties during disaster preparedness that influence the formation of collaborations during disaster response.

AB  - Sustainable consumption and production are considered to be fundamental ways to solve problems with environmental resources that human beings are facing. There is a broad consensus that promoting sustainable consumption requires the joint efforts of different social actors. This paper aims to define the roles of different stakeholders and the relationships between them, and then establish a modeling framework to analyze those relationships between stakeholders, which include members of government, business, consumer, mass media, environmental non-government organizations, education and research institutions, financial markets, etc. The research found that members of government, business, and consumers make up the core stakeholder network. The modeling framework could be used to evaluate sustainable consumption practices and identify deficiencies that would assist in defining better trajectories. This paper describes the evaluation of sustainable consumption practice in Tianjin, China from a stakeholder perspective to show how the modeling framework can function. According to this analysis, the following six actions may promote sustainable consumption practices in areas like Tianjin: 1) the cultivation of a consciousness of sustainable consumption, 2) the exemplary role of government, 3) a series of laws, regulations, and policies, 4) a thorough sustainable consumption action plan, 5) an insistence on sustainable production and consumption by businesses and consumers, and 6) the concerted efforts of various stakeholders.

AB  - Transdisciplinary collaboration between academia, government, industry, and civil society is considered an effective approach by both scholars and practitioners to foster sustainable and transformative societal change. One way to put transdisciplinarity into practice is through experimentation. Implementing "transition experiments" in real-world settings can make it possible to test, adapt, and scale up new and innovative ideas and practices. Despite extensive research on transition experiments, detailed knowledge of their practical realization remains lacking. This is especially true regarding the step from conceptualization to implementation, which is recognized as very challenging. We address this gap by analyzing the move from conceptualization to implementation in a specific transdisciplinary project aimed at achieving regional climate neutrality in the Swiss Alps. In particular, we focus on different actor configurations involved in this process and the implementation-related supporting and hindering factors that they experienced. Based on qualitative interviews and a stakeholder workshop, we found that actors involved in facilitation of the transdisciplinary process tend to evaluate the process differently compared with actors tasked with actual implementation. We conclude that ongoing monitoring of the different actor configurations is key to identifying distinct experiences and to making adjustments to best support implementation efforts.

AB  - To achieve social justice, equality, and quality of life under the concerted efforts deliberated for community development, countries engage in a range of interventions focusing on participation, capacity building, and sustainability. In this study, we examine two specific characteristics of livelihood interventions, development and empowerment; their relationship; and impact on community well-being. The findings suggest that while outcomes related to development and empowerment processes have a positive but meagre impact on community well-being, there is lack of continuum between them and the relationship is conditioned by convergence and governance. Further, insights from interviews also suggest that though there are institutional voids, challenging changing context, and variations in the way mobilization and participation are employed, those that will integrate good governance and strong convergence can deliver better outcomes.

AB  - Higher education institutions (HEIs) in Albania and Kosovo have invested considerable efforts to tackle present regional sustainability challenges on a research-based and strategic level. This happened through their traditional role as a provider of research and education. Additional activities fostering HEIs as a driver for sustainable regional development and innovation have been initiated as part of their third mission. However, customized education approaches were missing in order to fulfill specific regional demands of different research and learning projects in collaboration with regional actors. This paper explores the recently finished project "Connecting Science-Society Collaboration for Sustainability Innovation-ConSus" which focuses on the efforts of HEIs in Albania and Kosovo to tackle present regional sustainability challenges in both countries. An analytical framework regarding collaborative learning opportunities towards sustainable regional development and innovation has been drafted based on five key elements (capacities of HEIs in regional development, planning, learning and implementation theory, and action research). This framework has been applied to analyze the learning activities of the ConSus project. As a main finding, customized education approaches in the contexts of sustainable development (SD) and collaboration of scientific and regional actors are important elements to cope comprehensively with real-world problems.

AB  - In social-ecological systems, natural resource management can be characterized by trade-offs across sectors andsustainability targets. The water-energy-food (WEF) nexus concept makes explicit various trade-offs in order to maximize synergies ofinterventions. However, there are few successful examples of its operationalization in research settings. Here, we explore in a learningsetting if sustainability impact assessment (SIA) protocols can be a useful process to be used to adopt a systemic, interdisciplinaryperspective to operationalize WEF nexus in research for sustainable development. The process and method adopted of SIA protocol,evaluated for five exemplary WEF nexus cases in Central Asia during a week-long international workshop, adequately addressed thecomplexity of WEF interrelationships and associated sustainability issues, and facilitated a comparative case study analysis acrossscales. Results within this process highlight that water governance was critical for large-scale transboundary WEF nexus management,while land and soil management were decisive for minimizing trade-offs at local levels. Issues of interdisciplinarity, complexity,uncertainty, and reflection on impacts were adequately addressed, but challenges remain in the consideration of ethics and the designof transparent, multi-actor cooperation. Most importantly, this exercise showed that employment of the process of SIA protocolsupported disciplinary experts to work across disciplines and take a systemic approach for analyzing WEF nexus.

AB  - Climate change is a pressing global challenge, and companies are under increasing pressure to adopt sustainable practices and transparently disclose their environmental performance. This study focuses on the Italian pharmaceutical industry to gain insights into the level of stakeholder and management attention to climate change and the growth of academic research in this critical area. We employ a bibliometric analysis of scientific literature and a content analysis of financial statements to examine sustainability practices and reporting in both pharmaceutical and chemical companies. Our findings reveal a significant difference in stakeholder expectations and commitment to addressing climate change between the two industries. The chemical industry has demonstrated a stronger focus on sustainability, as evidenced by higher academic research and environmental disclosure levels. In contrast, the pharmaceutical sector has shown a comparatively lower level of environmental reporting and sustainability practices. However, our analysis shows a positive trend in pharmaceutical companies' voluntary disclosure of environmental information in their financial reports. These results highlight the need for increased focus and effort in the pharmaceutical industry to address climate change and improve sustainability practices. Pharmaceutical companies can build stakeholder trust, improve environmental sustainability, increase transparency in reporting, align practices with global sustainability goals, enhance their reputation, and reduce their environmental impact. This research provides valuable guidance for policymakers, researchers and practitioners in promoting sustainable practices in the pharmaceutical industry and contributes to the broader understanding of ESG disclosure and climate change.

AB  - Sustainable construction projects affect various stakeholders with different social, environmental and economic interests. It is essential that the decision makers maintain effective communication with relevant groups to avoid project failures. Although citizen participation offers a means of better addressing and meeting stakeholder concerns and expectations, the decision/evaluations of contemporary sustainable projects are becoming ever more complicated, with an increasing number of stakeholders involved to actively defend their own interests. In response, this paper provides a thorough and comprehensive analysis of the stakeholders of sustainable construction in China and quantifies their influence in decision/evaluations by semi-structured interviews (in research stage I) and a three-round Delphi survey (in research stage II). Follow-up interviews (in research stage III) are carried out to collect more in-depth views concerning the characteristics and the respective importance of each stakeholder group involved. The findings indicate that the government is the most influential entity and the extent to which its intervention is needed in balancing the interests of other stakeholders presents a major challenge. The high potential influence of end-users is also identified, suggesting the need for a more transparent and inclusive participatory decision/evaluation process in the country. An enhanced future role for NGOs is further identified. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Higher education institutions have an important role to play in addressing such challenges through their capacity to bring together diverse stakeholders and implement structured learning activities that can enable transformation on a personal and societal level. This article presents a case study of how urban sustainability has been incorporated into various courses run by the TD (transdisciplinary) School at the University of Technology Sydney. The findings illustrate that a transdisciplinary approach to higher education can facilitate transformative learning through a focus on real-world challenges, complex systems thinking, the integration of diverse knowledges and reflexivity. The lessons emerging from the case study demonstrate the importance of both enabling students to obtain a transdisciplinary skillset through their education and ensuring that educators adopt a transdisciplinary mindset to curriculum design.

AB  - In this paper, I provide insights into how action research influenced the movement of Australian early childhood educators' worldviews, identities, and their agency in relation to education for sustainability (EfS) in natural outdoor settings. This was integral to a larger study that explored early childhood educators' understandings of a nature-sustainability nexus and its influence on their pedagogies in Australian immersive nature play programmes. The findings indicated personal transformations for some participants as individuals and as teams of early childhood professionals, resulting in new discourses for EfS-with others engaging in an ongoing journey of disrupting dominant anthropocentric ways of thinking.

AB  - Across the world, organised groups of farmers participating in just and sustainability transformations encounter multiple obstacles. Through solidarity manifested in iterative processes of questioning, co-learning, collective action and reflection, and value creation for themselves and for others, some succeed in overcoming them. This article investigates how a district organic farmer association in Zimbabwe is encountering and handling group solidarity challenges arising from shifting from local to district level coordinated organic production and marketing. Based on the use of change laboratory, this paper explores solidarity at the local niche and networked district level to seek insights into the qualities of T-learning.

AB  - International Oil Companies (IOCs) are increasingly becoming key development actors in communities where they operate. This is becoming the norm as IOCs come to the realisation that their contributions to the well-being of their host communities brings them closer to attaining their business goals. The evaluation of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) actions by IOCs operating in Nigeria's oil rich Niger Delta is however characterised by a unilateral self-assessment by IOCs themselves, without commensurate integration of host community participation. In providing an alternative approach, this study utilised a participatory community-based appraisal to evaluate the Shell Petroleum Development Company's (SPDC), Global Memorandum of Understanding (GMoU) model within the praxis of selected parameters for sustainable community development including ownership, participation, sustainability and transparency. The study argues that due to the limitations of universal indicators in the assessment of community development problems, a combination of community-based parameters works better in evaluating community development.

AB  - Achieving successful multi-stakeholder collaboration for sustainable outcomes is complex. This paper provides key principles for future co-design projects aimed at fostering an inclusive approach to research. These have been developed based on a novel methodology that co-designed the essential components of a long-term, collaborative agreement for a nature recovery scheme in England. Using an assortment of iterative, deliberative participatory methods, this research engaged a wide variety of stakeholders to produce a template agreement for an agri-environmental policy. We demonstrate that a flexible, highly reflective approach resulted in positive engagement with previously marginalised stakeholders. The approach also successfully navigated the unequal power dynamics seen both within and between groups. Finally, multiple feedback loops allowed participants to continually build on previous interactions as they developed and reviewed the agreement. By drawing out the complexities of the co-design process, this paper explains how co-design efforts can produce potentially transformative outputs. We hope that the principles introduced here offer a useful starting point for those planning to undertake multi-stakeholder co-design.

AB  - In the context of the global climate change debate, the integration of Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) in higher education institutions (HEIs) has been identified as one of the top priorities. This paper presents the CoDesignS ESD Framework (hereafter "Framework") focused on HEIs, though the Framework is applicable to other types of educational institutions. The Framework introduces transformative pedagogies and teaching methods that extend beyond typical ESD competencies, encompassing cognitive, socio-emotional, and behavioral domains for a holistic design and delivery. It was evaluated using a focus group and interviews among sustainability practitioners and academics, learning and curriculum designers, students, and government officials involved in ESD. The evaluation demonstrates key stakeholders' engagement with the Framework and appreciation of its potential to integrate sustainability into university curricula across different disciplines. The findings suggest that the Framework is easy to use, making sustainability explicit in the curriculum and actively developing the competencies students require to bring about change beyond the classroom. The feedback received has helped the further development of the Framework, including the CoDesignS ESD Toolkit Planner and Dashboard, which provide a more effective way of integrating the learning design and ESD components embedded as part of the CoDesignS ESD pillars.

AB  - More and better collaboration between farmers and other stakeholders has repeatedly been identified as a key strategy for sustainable agriculture. However, for collaboration to actually benefit sustainable agriculture certain conditions have to be met. In this paper, we scrutinize the conditions that support or hamper the success of collaborative efforts in the context of sustainable agriculture. For this purpose, we conducted an exploratory case study meta-analysis to consolidate insights from 30 case studies on local and regional collaborative groups for a more sustainable agriculture in the EU. Through multiple regression analysis, we evaluated which factors influence the 'success' of such collaboratives. Thereby, we measured success through five explicit and comprehensive success criteria. We found two external, five actor-related, and five organization and management-related factors to decisively influence the different success criteria. Overall, our results highlight that collaboration success requires defining priorities as for each of the success criteria a different set of factors is decisive. Although our results showed trade-offs between the achievement of social and economic goals, it is possible to pursue some success criteria simultaneously. Furthermore, our results give reason to be optimistic about the performance of collaboratives: internal factors, which are in the hand of the collaboratives, are likely to be of greater importance than uncontrollable external conditions. Additionally, conditions encountered at the outset of a collaborative matter less than the way these conditions develop toward later stages. Thus, rather than depending on external and predefined conditions, success largely depends on the agency within the collaboratives.

AB  - To achieve sustainable rural development, it is necessary to simultaneously protect ecologically important land and efficiently use existing agricultural land. Land use functions (LUFs) are widely used to assess regional sustainable development. Guyuan is located in a typical hilly and gully region of western China, with ecologically fragile land. Rural land transfer (RLT) has been advocated to prevent abandonment of agricultural land and promote rational, effective utilization of the land. In this study, we used LUFs in a multi-level stakeholder assessment framework to integrate the opinions of all stakeholders in an evaluation of the impact of RLT on regional sustainable development. We employed the framework for participatory impact assessment, key informant interviews, and questionnaires to obtain data to support the development of scenarios to compare the impacts on LUFs. We found that RLT had positive impacts on each LUF in Guyuan, especially for the land-based production and food security LUFs. Importantly, the measures required to support RLT must vary among landforms and location conditions to successfully develop the LUFs and ensure sustainable development. We found that the integrated multi-level stakeholder assessment framework can comprehensively assess the impacts of land use measures on sustainable development and support regional land-use decision-making.

AB  - This paper introduces several notions and a collection of manuscripts compiled for a special section of The Extractive Industries and Society on the temporal and spatial trajectories of mining territories. These papers were developed from presentations delivered at two international conferences held in 2018: the TRAMIN ("Socioenvironmental Trajectories of Mining Territories") conference and the Social Geology session at the RFG ("Resources for Future Generations") conference, that took place respectively in Chambe ' ry (France) and Vancouver (Canada). The introduction paper situates these pieces in the wider literature, exploring the connections between mineral resources and the development of societies that exploit, transform and sell them. It also argues that using a polyphonic notion such as "trajectories" allows for the adoption of an interdisciplinary approach leading to key insights on sustainability for mining territories.

AB  - The concept of sustainable development has become widely accepted among nations, organisations and individuals. According to the Bruntland Commission, Sustainable Development is defined as a development that meets the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability for future generations to meet their needs. In this conceptual study, we outline a simplistic framework of aspects, variables, and relations constituting a workable definition of 'sustainable success' inspired by previous theoretical models. The aim is to contribute to a pragmatic clarification of how the concept of sustainable development could be more understandable, measurable, and manageable during global uncertainty and rapid change. A theoretical background is presented, followed by an overview of the method of investigation with a subsequent presentation of the results and a reasoning that frames the conceptual framework on critical constructs for measuring sustainable success based on stakeholder perceptions.

AB  - It is widely stated in the literature that the worldwide use of material resources is rising in tandem with population growth. In proportion to the rise in human population, it is anticipated that the amount of waste will increase as well. Therefore, those environmental issues that pose a growing threat to life and ecosystems must be addressed. As stated in the literature, by implementing a circular economy, for example, the amount of unprocessed trash generated at the household level can be effectively managed. The concept of a circular economy provides a solution to the problem of community waste by creating new products from waste resources that have economic value. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to identify obstacles to achieving sustainable development with a circular economy system in terms of household waste management in the Rawa Pitu district, Lampung province on the Indonesian island of Sumatra. The study is qualitative in nature, with data analysis techniques including interviews, observations, and questionnaires, with a total of 104 participants. The data analysis included data collection, data reduction, data display, and conclusion drawings. The findings indicate that in the Rawa Pitu district, it has not been possible to maximize public participation in addressing waste management issues. This is due to the fact that there has been no action taken by the local government regarding the management of household waste, and there has been no shift in the community's approach to waste management. For this, we need an alternative solution in the form of a circular economy by implementing the 3Rs (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle). Consequently, the involvement of stakeholders in shaping community participation in achieving sustainable development is crucial, and there is a need for continuous oversight. As well as discussing the implications of the findings, we offer several suggestions for additional studies.

AB  - This paper explores the role of boundary objects in the translation and transformation process of a sustainability concept-Sustainability Development Goals (SDGs)-into a firm's business practices. The qualitative case study describes the experience where a Japanese company successfully implemented SDGs and generated product innovations through its learning process. The findings of the study identify four types of effective boundary objects: (1) organizational repository boundary objects, including historical contextualization and best practices; (2) a standardized form of boundary objects based on certification process of environmental sustainable products; (3) an ideal type of boundary objects through digital forum based learning platform; (4) a "powerful" community of practices that come across hierarchy and functions. This paper extends the literature by showing the interconnectedness of boundary objects, the possible negative side of technology based boundary objects, and the significance of community of practices as a monitoring and coordination tool to ensure the effective operation and measurement of sustainability.

AB  - Complex sustainability challenges may never be fully solved, rather requiring continuous, adaptive, and reflexive responses over time. Engagement of this nature departs from well-structured problems that entail expected solutions; here, focus shifts toward ill-structured or ill-defined issues characterized by wickedness. In the context of complex challenges, inadequate or absent framing has performative implications on action. By overlooking the value of framing, eventual responses may not only fall short; they may even displace, prolong, or exacerbate situations by further entrenching unsustainability. In educational settings, we know little about how curriculum designs support challenge framing, and how students experience and learn framing processes. In this paper we explore a transdisciplinary "Challenge Lab" (C-Lab) curriculum from a perspective of challenge framing. When considering framing in higher education, we turn to the agenda in education for, as and with sustainable development to be problem-solving, solutions-seeking or challenge-driven. We introduce framing as a boundary object for transformative praxis, where sustainability is held to be complex and contextual. This study is qualitative and case-based, designed to illuminate processes of and experiences into sustainability challenge framing in a transdisciplinary learning setting. Methodologically, we draw from student reflective diaries that span the duration of a curriculum design. We structure our results with the support of three consecutive lenses for understanding "curriculum": intended, enacted, and experienced curriculum. First, we present and describe a C-Lab approach at the level of ambition and design. Here it is positioned as a student-centered space, process, and institutional configuration, working with framing and re-framing complex sustainability challenges in context. Second, we present a particular C-Lab curriculum design that unfolded in 2020. Third, we illustrate the lived experiences and practical realities of participating in C-Lab as students and as teachers. We reflect upon dilemmas that accompany challenge framing in C-Lab and discuss the methodological implications of this study. Finally, we point toward fruitful research avenues that may extend understandings of challenge framing in higher education.

AB  - With the deployment of information and communication technologies (ICTs) and the needs of data and information sharing within cities, smart city aims to provide value-added services to improve citizens' quality of life. But, currently city planners/developers are faced with inadequate contextual information on the dimensions of smart city required to achieve a sustainable society. Therefore, in achieving sustainable society, there is need for stakeholders to make strategic decisions on how to implement smart city initiatives. Besides, it is required to specify the smart city dimensions to be adopted in making cities smarter for sustainability attainment. But, only a few methods such as big data, internet of things, cloud computing, etc. have been employed to support smart city attainment. Thus, this study integrates case-based reasoning (CBR) as an artificial intelligence technique to develop a recommender system towards promoting smart city planning. CBR provides suggestions on smart city dimensions to be adopted by city planners/decision-makers in making cities smarter and sustainable. Accordingly, survey data were collected from 115 respondents to evaluate the applicability of the implemented CBR recommender system in relation to how the system provides best practice recommendations and retaining of smart city initiatives. Results from descriptive and exploratory factor analyses suggest that the developed system is applicable in supporting smart city adoption. Besides, findings from this study are expected to provide valuable insights for practitioners to develop more practical strategies and for researchers to better understand smart city dimensions.

AB  - To better understand how individuals, groups, and organizations can use information systems more effectively, a research approach closer to the level of social interchange is required. A multiple-level, sustainable, information-technology (IT) learning framework, rooted in patterns of practice and constructed by participatory action research, offers an alternative methodology for investigating sustainable strategies of IT learning. The framework evolved from concrete instances of IT learning across organizational case studies. A patterns-based analysis of the ethnographic data enabled the examination of informal IT learning in community contexts and the identification of IT interventions more likely to produce successful learning outcomes.

AB  - This study introduces a stochastic optimization model designed for enhancing coal procurement and logistics management at port-based coal-fired power plants. Addressing the dual pressures of economic efficiency and environmental sustainability, this model incorporates the complexities of maritime transportation uncertainties, varying demand, and stringent carbon emission controls. Through this framework, we effectively align procurement strategies with inventory management to optimize operations under dynamic conditions. The model's distinctiveness lies in its integration of real-time maritime variables and adaptive responses to environmental policies, setting a new standard for green logistics in the energy sector. Key results demonstrate the effectiveness of mixed coal procurement strategies across different demand scenarios, highlighting significant savings in carbon emissions and operational costs. Our findings provide valuable insights for policymakers and industry stakeholders aiming to achieve sustainable development goals in the energy sector.

AB  - Sustainability competences are reflected in the ability to look ahead to change and shape the future of the societies in which they live through active participation in the sense of sustainable development. Through service-learning, students take responsibility for their actions. The complex nature of sustainability issues makes it useful to explore problems and their solutions holistically. In the framework of the NEMOS project (A New Educational Model for Acquiring Sustainability Competences through Service-Learning), a collaborative process was initiated to pool the knowledge and experience of five Higher Education Institutions working together to implement new educational models for effectively acquiring sustainability competences through service-learning in food-related degrees. This EU-funded project was launched and aimed to advance the transition to sustainability education through practical and innovative educational approaches and interventions. Green pedagogy can support transformative learning through the exploration and clarification of learners<acute accent>own values. In the case of the Public University of Navarre (UPNA), which leads the NEMOS project, practical sessions on service-learning and green pedagogies were held to train university lecturers who teach in different degrees to integrate sustainability in higher education, recognising the relevance of the connection with the environment and the active participation of educators in this process.

AB  - Project-based sustainability courses require and facilitate diverse interactions among students, instructors, stakeholders, and mentors. Most project-based courses take an instrumental approach to these interactions, so that they support the overall project deliverables. However, as courses primarily intend to build students' key competencies in sustainability, including the competence to collaborate in teams and with stakeholders, there are opportunities to utilize these interactions more directly to build students' interpersonal competence. This study offers insights from project-based sustainability courses at universities in Germany, the U.S., Switzerland, and Spain to empirically explore such opportunities. We investigate how students develop interpersonal competence by learning from (rather than through) their interactions with peers, instructors, stakeholders, and mentors. The findings can be used by course instructors, curriculum designers, and program administrators to more deliberately use the interactions with peers, instructors, stakeholders, and mentors in project-based sustainability courses for developing students' competence to successfully collaborate in teams and with stakeholders.

AB  - Concerns over groundwater depletion and ecosystem degradation have led to the incorporation of the concept of groundwater sustainability as a groundwater policy instrument in several water codes and management directives worldwide. Because sustainable groundwater management is embedded within integrated, co-evolving hydrological, ecological, and socioeconomic systems, implementing such policies remains a challenge for water managers and the scientific community. The problem is further exacerbated when participatory processes are lacking, resulting in a communication gap among water authorities, scientists, and the broader community. This paper provides a systematic review of the concept of groundwater sustainability, and situates this concept within the calls from the hydrologic literature for more participatory and integrated approaches to water security. We discuss the definition of groundwater sustainability from both a policy and scientific perspective, tracing the evolution of this concept from safe yield, to sustainable groundwater management. We focus on the diversity of societal values related to groundwater sustainability, and the typology of the aquifer performance and governance factors. In addition, we systematically review the main components of an effective scientific evaluation of groundwater sustainability policy, which are multi-process modeling, uncertainty analysis, and participation. We conclude that effective groundwater sustainability policy implementation requires an iterative scientific evaluation that (i) engages stakeholders in a participatory process through collaborative modeling and social learning; (ii) provides improved understanding of the coevolving scenarios between surface water-groundwater systems, ecosystems, and human activities; and (iii) acknowledges and addresses uncertainty in our scientific knowledge and the diversity of societal preferences using multi-model uncertainty analysis and adaptive management. Although the development of such a transdisciplinary research approach, which connects policy, science, and practice for groundwater sustainability evaluation, is still in its infancy worldwide, we find that research towards groundwater sustainability is growing at a much faster rate than groundwater research as a whole.

AB  - Within the health sciences, organizational participatory research (OPR) is defined as a blend of research and action, in which academic researchers partner with health organization members. OPR is based on a sound partnership between all stakeholders to improve organizational practices. However, little research on the evaluation of OPR health partnership exists. This systematic mixed studies review sought to produce a new theoretical model that structures the evaluation of the OPR processes and related outcomes of OPR health partnerships. Six bibliographic databases were searched together with grey literature sources for OPR health partnership evaluation questionnaires. Six questionnaires were included, from which a pool of 95 OPR health partnership evaluation items were derived. The included questionnaires were appraised for the quality of their origin, development and measurement properties. A framework synthesis was performed using an existing OPR framework by organizing questionnaire items in a matrix using a hybrid thematic analysis. This led to our proposed Organizational Participatory Research Evaluation Model (OPREM) that includes three axes, Trust, Collective Learning and Sustainability (with specific dimensions) and 95 items. This model provides information to help stakeholders comprehensively structure the evaluation of their partnerships and subsequent improvement; thus, potentially helping to improve health organization practices.

AB  - This paper explores the dimensions that influence supply chain sustainability learning, how these dimensions are inter-related, and how they can impact in the evolution of supply chain sustainability trajectories. Employing a systematic literature review technique, this paper offers a combined scoping and tertiary review to shed light into the concept of supply chain sustainability learning. In total, 33 review articles were analyzed (20 from tertiary review and 13 from scoping review), covering over 3652 primary research articles combined. The findings allowed for the emergence of four major contributions. First, an integrated framework of supply chain sustainability learning is proposed, which includes key dimensions such as sustainability capabilities and environmental turbulence. Second, this paper develops a process-based approach, describing four non-linear distinct processes (i.e., set-up, operating, sustaining, and updating) that allow supply chains to learn. Third, it articulates a clear and important conceptual distinction between the constructs of sustainability transitions and supply chain sustainability trajectories, emphasizing the relevance of the latter for supply chain sustainability learning. Fourth, for practitioners, this paper enhances the understanding of how supply chains learn and incorporate sustainability into their routine, consequently improving their sustainability trajectories.

AB  - Purpose Despite the growing emphasis on revitalizing the technical and vocational education and training (TVET) sector in Bangladesh, very little discussion has taken place on reforming the current inflexible transition pathways, from TVET to the universities. This paper aims to reflect critically on the existing literature on TVET, in the global and national context, and the experiences of students and TVET experts, to develop a model of collaboration between the polytechnic institutes and the universities in Bangladesh. Design/methodology/approach This paper follows a qualitative strategy of enquiry, using a mix of critical reflection on literature on TVET and higher education and unstructured interviews with two TVET experts, four TVET students and four students from a public university. It draws on the theories of collaboration and uses exemplary cases to illustrate and support the line of reasoning. Findings This paper identifies that there is resource dependency between the polytechnic institutes and universities in Bangladesh, and their institutional environment necessitates them to form collaboration to ensure flexible transition pathway, from polytechnic institutes to universities; this paper proposes a model for such collaboration.
   Originality/value This paper contributes in the recent discussions on how collaboration among different stakeholders can contribute in achieving the sustainable development goals, with special emphasis on TVET.

AB  - Much emphasis has been placed on the importance of learning to support collaborative environmental management and achieve sustainability under conditions of social-ecological change. Yet, on-going struggles to learn from experience and respond to complex social-ecological conditions reflect an emerging paradox. Despite widespread support of learning as a normative goal and process, core concepts, assumptions and approaches to learning have been applied in vague and sometimes uncritical ways. Greater specificity with respect to learning goals, approaches and outcomes is required. In response to this gap, we examine five dimensions of the learning paradox in the context of adaptive co-management, where the learning and linking functions of governance are stressed: (i) definitions of learning;, (ii) learning goals and expectations; (iii) mechanisms by which learning takes place; (iv) questions regarding who is involved in the process of learning; and (v) the risks and ethical ambiguities faced by different actors expected to willingly participate in a learning process.. whether formal or informal. Lessons from experience with a series of cases from the global North and South illustrate the implications of these dimensions. Resolving the dimensions of this learning paradox will require greater attention to capacity-building, recognition of the role of risk, and consideration of how incentives could be used to encourage learning. Further consideration of the role of power and marginality among groups participating in the learning process is also needed, as is more systematic evaluation to monitor and measure learning outcomes.

AB  - A collective action approach to rice seed production is an inclusive method involving the community's active participation at all stages of its execution. This all-inclusive strategy, however, has yet to be thoroughly investigated and published. This study explored how and to what degree an inclusive rice seed business of Gapoktan, based on a collective action approach, might be deployed in a sustainable rice seed company run by community groups. The research comprised the following stages: (1) establishment of a seed production business institution, (2) production of rice seeds, and (3) self-assessment of the performance of the seed production business institution. Institutional data were acquired through a questionnaire that references the European Foundation for Quality Management's (EFQM) methodology. Three dimensions used were direction (purpose, vision, and strategy; organizational culture and leadership); execution (engaging stakeholders; coasting sustainable value; driving performance transformation); and result (stakeholder perceptions; strategic and operational performance). The study suggests essential findings: The organizational structure of rice seed producers formed is complete regarding its operational functions. The rice seeds produced by Gapoktan have met both the volume and quality standards. From a financial perspective, this rice seed production unit is feasible for further development. However, their social orientation is still relatively high and needs to be more profit-oriented. Uniquely, not all members buy and use Gapoktan seeds. As a result, additional efforts are necessary to provide exceptional service to Gapoktan members.

AB  - After several decades of work toward elevating sustainability education, many have called for a transformation of the education system to create timely action. Teachers, students, organizational leaders, and many other stakeholders have voiced their dissatisfaction with their experience of sustainability education. Some say we can do more to create real action for sustainable futures. We investigate what, how and why lectures across disciplines at universities in different countries work with sustainability education. We conduct interviews and dialogs with teachers across disciplines to uncover interdisciplinary perspectives on sustainability education and how to move forward. The emerging reflections provide insights about transformations in the strategies and systems, and how to implement sustainability education. There is also a call for reuniting diverse intrapersonal and values thinking between stakeholders to support transformations in sustainability education. Furthermore, participants imagined the future as a creative space where collaboration across disciplines facilitates a student-centred transdisciplinary experience with real-world practice. This study provides insights into the mindset of teachers across disciplines and countries. A sustainability competence-based support model about the current sustainability education discourse is developed.

AB  - Sustainable Development Goal 12 (SDG 12) is vital for promoting sustainable development by enhancing resource efficiency, minimizing waste, and fostering sustainable practices across supply chains. This research investigates sustainable production and consumption dynamics in European Union countries, drawing on official data from the EU Statistical Office (Eurostat). It employs the AAA (Holt-Winters) exponential smoothing algorithm to analyze trends in selected sustainability indicators. Despite notable progress, challenges such as regional disparities and economic barriers remain significant. This research provides critical insights into the evolution of responsible consumption and production across EU countries, projecting trends until 2030. The findings emphasize the need for integrated policies, sustainable practices, and collaborative efforts among stakeholders to meet the EU's sustainability objectives. Achieving these goals is essential for realizing the 2030 sustainability targets and transitioning to a climate-neutral economy by 2050, ensuring long-term ecological and economic resilience.

AB  - The notion of sustainability, in its three-fold meaning (economic, environmental, and social), is being adopted more and more by companies. Today it is widely accepted that sustainability cannot be achieved by firms in isolation, but requires the collaboration of all supply chain players. This issue is particularly relevant in industrial contexts where the supply chains are complex in terms of structure and number of players, such as the construction industry. Thus, the aim of the paper is to explore the sustainability practices adopted in the construction industry, with a particular attention to the role of environmental collaboration of supply chain partners in achieving sustainability. By means of multiple case study-based research, we investigate sustainability practices on a sample of construction companies of Italy, thus identifying three main sustainability approaches, which differ in both the strategic orientation towards sustainability and the level of implementation in design, purchasing, and governance processes, as well as the main variables driving the adoption of these approaches.

AB  - Participatory modeling is a potentially high-impact approach for catalyzing fundamental sustainability transformations. We test if participation in a group system dynamics modeling exercise increases participants' agency through a novel method to evaluate potential behavioral change using expectation measures. A water-energy-food nexus-a functionally interdependent but underconceptualized system with low consensus and high scientific uncertainty-was mapped, and its evolution simulated by 46 participants in three interventions in a region undergoing hydropower infrastructure development in Northeastern Cambodia. Participants' system-related expectations were measured before and after the interventions. Our results suggest that participants became significantly more optimistic about their individual agency to increase agricultural and fishing income and, interestingly, less likely to participate in local government development planning procedures. Findings also reveal how some uncertainties for multiple variables were reduced within and across the groups. Such converging expectations suggest that participatory modeling could contribute to making collective solutions and institutionalized agreements more likely. This research contributes to innovation in sustainability because it unpacks some underlying mechanics of how participatory processes can lead to new adaptive capacities, shared perspectives, and collective actions.

AB  - Synergizing air pollution control and climate change mitigation has been of significant academic and policy concern. The synergy between air pollution and carbon emissions is one of the measures to understand the characteristics and process of the air pollution-carbon synergistic control, which will also provide valuable information for collaboratively achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (such as SDGs 11 and 13). This study establishes a systematic framework integrating emissions inventory and projection models, correlation mining and typology analysis methods to predictively evaluate the synergy and comprehensive coordination between air pollution and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in Chinese cities by 2030, 2050, and 2060 under different policy scenarios for air pollution and CO2 emissions control. The results reveal the significant effects of synergistically implementing clean air and aggressive carbon-reducing policies on mitigating air pollution and CO2 emissions. Under the On-time Peak-Net Zero-Clean Air and Early Peak-Net Zero-Clean Air scenarios, the total reduction and synergy for air pollution and CO2 emissions will be more significant, particularly by 2050 and 2060. This study is the first to integrate scenario projection and synergy evaluation in air pollution and CO2 research, providing a novel supplement to the air pollution-climate change synergy methodology based on co-benefit estimation. The methods and findings will also contribute to measuring the achievement and analyzing the interaction of the SDGs.

TI  - Social interaction of leaders in partnerships between schools and universities: tensions as support and counterbalance
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LEADERSHIP IN EDUCATION
LA  - English
KW  - ORGANIZATIONS
AB  - Partnerships between schools and universities have been emphasized over the last two decades within educational development research. Moving from the traditional single-organization orientation toward a multiple-organization orientation has challenged school leaderships to improve their decision-making processes to align with changing organizational structures, resulting in wider use of partnerships. This study recognizes the importance of addressing the role of tension amongst leaders in partnerships between schools and universities. This paper presents a longitudinal study, inspired by constructivist grounded theory, conducted in a pilot partnership between schools and a university. The data analysis was grounded in a mix of observations and document studies, all associated with multiple levels of leadership within the partnership. Three areas of tense situations were revealed: Assessment of investments, Assessments of outcomes, and Assessments of commitments. An acknowledgment of the tension was also evident in the findings. A theoretical framework of practice architectures was implemented to analyze the intersection of the findings. The findings highlighted how tension in social interaction can be both constructive and constraining in achieving a sustainable collaboration, depending on how well the plans and the main purpose of the partnership are aligned within the organizations.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine consumer intentions toward carpooling as a collaborative consumption practice. The paper uses the theory of planned behavior (TPB) in studying consumer intentions toward carpooling. It extends the theory to add personal norms as a major component in examining consumer intentions. It also adds two main motivational factors for collaborative consumption, which are economic benefits and sustainability. Design/methodology/approach This study is a conclusive descriptive study using surveys. The research sample consists of 500 respondents from millennials. The study uses structural equation modeling to analyze the survey results. Findings Results showed that subjective norms and attitudes had the most significant impact on intentions toward carpooling, followed by perceived behavioral control (PBC) and personal norms. Economic benefits and sustainability also showed a significant impact on attitudes toward carpooling practice. Measurement and structural models showed a good model fit. Originality/value The paper provides original data on consumer intentions toward carpooling as a type collaborative consumption behavior using the TPB with the inclusion of personal norms. The research also contributes to the growing nuances of sustainability in the context of the sharing economy. The study is considered the first of its kind to combine the TPB, personal norms and motivators of collaborative consumption, including economic benefits and sustainability, to examine their impact on intentions toward carpooling.

AB  - Collaboration among local actors is considered an important precondition for a sustainable transformation of the regional agri-food system. To date, however, little is known about the social innovation capacity of local farmers when it comes to the establishment of alternative food networks. This is especially true for farmers' collaborations with local government officials, which are becoming increasingly important in establishing sustainability-oriented markets for local products and services, especially in the agricultural sector that is often rooted in rigid logics, supply chains and institutions. Therefore, this paper aims to explore the concept of proximity as an analytical lens to understand private-public collaboration models that aim at facilitating sustainable transformation in rural areas. Drawing on concepts from innovation geography, this paper considers the influence of geographic, cognitive, institutional, organizational and social determinants of collaboration, enabling an evaluation of the social innovation capacity of local private and public actors. This theoretical approach helps to disassemble and differentiate social innovation processes to determine success strategies. The paper studies two rural communities where mayors aim to establish local food stores with regional products and, therefore, seek collaboration with local farmers. While the empirical aspect of the study is limited, the two cases provide an opportunity to test the theoretical framework. The proximity approach can be significant for regional agri-food system transformation and steering social innovation processes by considering the distinct capacities of actors. Our conclusion is that the examination of the absence and degree of proximity facilitates a better understanding of practical recommendations to promote agri-food system transformation.

KW  - Conception of transdisciplinarity

AB  - This article draws on social theory to advance conceptualization and methodology in transdisciplinary research. It starts with a short introduction to the state of debate on transdisciplinarity and its challenges and proposes adopting a procedural perspective on sustainability. It argues that sustainable development, understood as a learning process, is the subject matter for which transdisciplinary research provides the means. This is followed by sociological reflections on the main challenge of transdisciplinary research: the collaboration between scholars and non-academics. Such collaboration points to an ambivalence in conceptualizations of transdisciplinarity, as transdisciplinary research involves scientific activity while at the same time claiming to essentially be an activity beyond the sciences, namely, a joint activity of scientists and non-academics. This has led to several inconsistencies in the debates. Achieving greater consistency requires acknowledging the specific 'scientific bias' inherent in the concepts in the first place: the debate on transdisciplinary research is basically scientific self-reflection about the role of scholars in collaborative activities with non-academics. As a practical answer, professionalization is recommended. The subsequent section introduces a procedural approach to learning processes in transdisciplinary sustainability research. A general model of procedures promises conceptual progress by providing a methodological foundation for sustainable learning in science-practice cooperation as well as formal criteria for evaluating such learning. Finally, transdisciplinary research is defined as a specific kind of applied science.

AB  - Environmental threats and progressive degradation of natural resources are considered critical impediments to sustainable development. This paper reports on a participatory impact assessment of alternative soil and water conservation (SWC) scenarios in the Oum Zessar watershed, Tunisia. The first objective was to assess the impact of three SWC scenarios on key social, economic and environmental land use functions. The second objective was to test and evaluate the applicability of the 'Framework for Participatory Impact Assessment (FoPIA)' for assessing scenario impacts in the context of a developing country, in this case Tunisia. The assessed scenarios included: the originally planned SWC policy implementation at 85 % coverage of arable land of the watershed, the current implementation (70 %), and a hypothetical expansion of SWC measures to the entire watershed (100 %). Our results suggest that implementation of the SWC policy at 100 % coverage of arable land achieves the maximum socioeconomic benefit. However, if stakeholders' preferences regarding land use functions are taken into account, and considering the fact that the implementation of SWC measures also implies some negative changes to traditional landscapes and the natural system, SWC implementation at 85 % coverage of arable land might be preferable. The FoPIA approved to be a useful tool for conducting a holistic sustainability impact assessment of SWC scenarios and for studying the most intriguing sustainability problems while providing possible recommendations towards sustainable development. We conclude that participatory impact assessment contributes to an enhanced regional understanding of key linkages between policy effects and sustainable development, which provides the foundation for improved policy decision making.

AB  - Contemporary approaches to professional development (PD) involve investigating ways of bottom-up, self-directed practices while addressing various needs of teachers. Yet, utilized as a tool in such practices, classroom observation (CO) is not considered to promote teacher professional learning since it is generally regarded as part of the appraisal process. Thus, this exploratory case study aims to explore the insights of four EFL teachers about CO tailored by teachers themselves for their professional growth in a higher education context in Turkiye. Focusing on a bottom-up practice, the teachers pursued a collaborative act on their PD in this specific context. Based on the participants' previous and current experiences of CO, the data were collected through semi-structured interviews and teacher educator notes. The inductive thematic analysis of the data revealed three major interconnected themes providing pathways toward CO as a PD tool with special emphasis on the generic features of the teacher-tailored CO process. The discussion of findings highlights the importance of empowering, collaborative, and sustainable practices in teachers' professional growth. Implications are included for English language teacher development programs.

AB  - PurposeThe efficient application of building information modeling (BIM) methodology in the sustainable building design process, known as green BIM, provides ideal leverage to significantly enhance multidiscipline team collaboration. However, the practical execution of green BIM is characterized by issues such as duplication of work, information silos and poor cross-party coordination. Besides, there are limited studies on the specific components that are critical to driving green BIM collaborative design. This study aims to establish the critical components of green BIM collaborative design to enable the multidiscipline team to effectively use diverse software to collaboratively exchange accurate information, thus ensuring informed decision-making in the sustainable building design process.Design/methodology/approachData were obtained by using a questionnaire to survey 360 respondents comprising mainly architects and engineers (civil, mechanical and electrical) in Malaysia. Subsequently, data were analyzed via confirmatory factor analysis. Afterward, a measurement model was established and used to test the 11 hypotheses of this study.FindingsA covariance-based structural equation model of the critical components for successful BIM-based sustainable building design collaboration was established.Practical implicationsThe research findings will guide the multidisciplinary team to collaboratively exchange accurate information in green BIM practices.Originality/valueTo the best of the authors' knowledge, this research is the first attempt in the literature to provide a pragmatic approach for practitioners to combine the established critical components of green BIM to collaboratively exchange heterogeneous sustainability criteria and efficiently design buildings with high sustainability performance, particularly in emerging countries like Malaysia.

AB  - Co-production, the collaborative weaving of research and practice by diverse societal actors, is argued to play an important role in sustainability transformations. Yet, there is still poor understanding of how to navigate the tensions that emerge in these processes. Through analyzing 32 initiatives worldwide that co-produced knowledge and action to foster sustainable social-ecological relations, we conceptualize 'co-productive agility' as an emergent feature vital for turning tensions into transformations. Co-productive agility refers to the willingness and ability of diverse actors to iteratively engage in reflexive dialogues to grow shared ideas and actions that would not have been possible from the outset. It relies on embedding knowledge production within processes of change to constantly recognize, reposition, and navigate tensions and opportunities. Co-productive agility opens up multiple pathways to transformation through: (1) elevating marginalized agendas in ways that maintain their integrity and broaden struggles for justice; (2) questioning dominant agendas by engaging with power in ways that challenge assumptions, (3) navigating conflicting agendas to actively transform interlinked paradigms, practices, and structures; (4) exploring diverse agendas to foster learning and mutual respect for a plurality of perspectives. We explore six process considerations that vary by these four pathways and provide a framework to enable agility in sustainability transformations. We argue that research and practice spend too much time closing down debate over different agendas for change - thereby avoiding, suppressing, or polarizing tensions, and call for more efforts to facilitate better interactions among different agendas.

AB  - Circular procurement (CP) represents the complex process of acquiring and managing goods, services, and works in a manner that supports circular economy principles, emphasizing waste reduction, material reuse, and resource regeneration. As an emerging paradigm, its success is modulated by several stakeholders, requiring cross-functional collaboration and a clear understanding of each stakeholder's roles and capabilities that can effectively navigate its intricacies. In this paper, we identify crucial stakeholder roles under the new CP paradigm and consolidate interrelationships among stakeholder groups. Using MoSCoW prioritization by six CP experts, the study conceptualizes capabilities that induce collaboration between different stakeholder roles for effective CP implementation. The findings of the study reveal critical stakeholders at each phase of CP implementation based on their power, legitimacy, urgency. Government agencies, design teams, circular audit experts, and endof-life management professionals are among the definitive stakeholders identified within the CP implementation process. In addition, their key collaborative capabilities for effective CP implementation were revealed as trust, coordination, decision-making power, technical knowledge, and information sharing capabilities. The study further identifies key areas to enhance collaboration for CP implementation among stakeholders, driving sustainable innovation and reducing environmental impacts. The findings and propositions provide decision support for practitioners and policy makers to enhance collaboration effectiveness, promote stakeholder satisfaction, and achieve successful sustainable outcomes.

AB  - Interdisciplinary collaboration has become mainstream practice for sustainability researchers. However, interdisciplinary research teams encounter numerous challenges for which they may find themselves under-prepared. In this article, we challenge the often-held assumption that researchers already know how to collaborate when entering interdisciplinary research teams and argue that, if we want to enhance interdisciplinary sustainability research, we need to take collaboration and its challenges seriously. First, we suggest thinking about interdisciplinary research collaborations as spaces that comprise epistemic, social, symbolic, spatial, and temporal dimensions and that produce different degrees of comfort and discomfort for researchers. Thinking about collaborations in this way supports a more systematic understanding of collaborative challenges. Second, we make a proposal for learning to collaborate while collaborating, so as to tackle challenges of interdisciplinary research. Drawing on a literature review and on experiences in the project Leverage Points for Sustainability Transformation, we argue for advancing collaborative interdisciplinary research for sustainability by creating and engaging in collaborations in ways that prioritize learning to collaborate. We outline a strategy for learning to collaborate while collaborating, which implies: (1) creating conditions for learning to take place, which includes paying attention to discomfort as a trigger for learning and (2) engaging in collaborations in ways that strengthen researchers' collaborative capacities by cultivating particular orientations, knowledge and skills. The fundamental inquiry is whether and how learning to collaborate has a role in more fully realizing the inspiring potentials and ambitious goals of interdisciplinary research for sustainability.

AB  - Empowering women farmers to participate in agricultural research is a key strategy for sustainable agricultural development. Women empowerment has the potential to improve their roles in agricultural production while enhancing nutrition and food security. Although new agricultural development policies are focusing on improving women engagement in agriculture, there is limited literature on women empowerment in relation to agricultural research. This study used mixed methods to analyse women farmers' participation in four stages of the agricultural research process - design, testing, dissemination, monitoring and evaluation. Two hundred and thirty individual interviews with women farmers and 16 focus group discussions with men and women farmers were conducted in four Woredas (districts) of Ethiopia. Quantitative data were analysed using binary and multivariate probit models. Qualitative data were analysed using line-by-line coding. The results showed that several empowerment indicator variables significantly (p <= .001) influenced women's participation in different stages of agricultural research. Specifically, input in production decisions, autonomy in plot management, membership to farmer groups, and ability to speak in public enhanced women's participation in different stages, in addition to access to information and extension services, education and land size. Cultural norms hindered women's empowerment and engagement in research. To foster sustainable agriculture development, it's important to integrate holistic and proactive gender perspectives into research strategies to increase women's participation in farmer research groups, access information and knowledge, have voice and challenge constraining cultural norms and traditions.

AB  - Cities, crucial cultural hubs, mould individual and group identities. The global urban expansion, with over half the population in urban areas, presents interconnected challenges such as pollution, poverty, inequality, ageing infrastructure, resource overconsumption, land use changes, biodiversity impact and climate change. Addressing these demands ambitious actions targeting political, social and economic systems for transformative change. The theoretical framework guiding city transformation centres on an interdisciplinary approach influenced by the Smart and Green Transition. The '15-minute city' concept, emphasizing human scale and urban experience, proposes that cities enable residents to meet daily needs within a short walk or bike ride. The aim of this study was the exploration of its implementation in Greek cities, particularly Thessaloniki, which reveals inherent characteristics supporting the 15-minute concept. Through an interdisciplinary approach rooted in the Smart and Green Transition framework, the research provides concrete guidance for policymakers in tailoring urban planning strategies, allocating resources effectively and crafting policies conducive to successful and sustainable urban transformations. Moreover, prioritizing public engagement highlights the significance of community involvement in shaping urban development plans, ensuring that proposed initiatives align with residents' needs and desires. In essence, this research contributes tangible insights and actionable recommendations for Greek cities, paving the way for more liveable, resilient and sustainable urban environments.

AB  - Purpose This study attempts to find the structural relationship between Total Quality Management (TQM) and Corporate Sustainability (CS) by analyzing the role of Innovation Capability (IC). Design/methodology/approach The authors conducted the study in the context of manufacturing industries in the Indian Micro Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) sector. In the process, The authors attempt to throw light on the significance of TQM and IC in bringing out sustainable practices in organizations. The authors used Structural Equation Modeling with AMOS to study the relationship between TQM and CS. Findings The authors measured TQM through product control management, process control, vendor quality management and customer relationship improvement. We did find a direct relationship between TQM and CS, along with its three dimensions: environmental sustainability, economic sustainability and social sustainability. TQM was found to be antecedent to IC. IC, measured through product innovation, process innovation and managerial innovation, did not mediate the relation between TQM and CS. However, the link between TQM and social and environmental sustainability partially mediates through IC at the dimension level. Practical implications TQM can provide a holistic means of nurturing participation and satisfaction of stakeholders for achieving corporate sustainability and in the process, can create an innovative culture for stimulating a circular social economy. Originality/value This study fills the gap in the literature by providing a structural model that explains the relationship between TQM and corporate sustainability and highlights the role of innovation capability in achieving it.

AB  - Higher education tends to situate sustainability epistemologically as transmissive education about and/or transactional education for sustainability. Sustainability educators argue that these approaches remain part of the dominant dualist and reductionist way of teaching and learning-a weak sustainability. What is needed is a transformative learning process as sustainability. Numerous sustainability educators and practitioners propose a strong sustainability supported by ecological relationality. In this chapter, I draw from ecological living systems principles (Capra in The hidden connections: a science for sustainable living. Anchor Books, New York, 2004) and relational agential realism (Barad in Differences: A Journal of Feminist Cultural Studies 10: 87-126, 2007) to illustrate an innovative pedagogical approach of the environmental sciences. Calling it kitchen-based learning it uses cooking, eating and sensing as a relational transformative learning process towards (be) coming and (re) membering social and ecological sustainability. A vision for tomorrow's campus in higher education is to include innovation in pedagogy giving attention to how students learn as a process of educating as sustainably.

AB  - Transnational collaborations between universities provide an underutilized opportunity to teach sustainability competencies emphasizing the global and local nature of (un)sustainability. This article asks: what kind of curricula and teaching-learning environments can we use in transnational collaborations so as to prepare future generations to address (un)sustainability across different scales and contexts? The article presents a glocal model for transnational collaboration for sustainability which combines the use of digital technologies for global collaboration with experiences and engagement for local learning and impact. The glocal model was designed and implemented in The Global Classroom, a collaborative project between Arizona State University and Leuphana University of Luneburg. The model fills two important gaps in higher education for sustainable development. In the theory, it provides new concepts to think about the curriculum and teaching-learning environment of transnational collaborations for sustainability. In the practice, it presents an exemplary implementation that can inform the curriculum as well as the teaching-learning environment of such collaborations. The article concludes that transnational collaborations for sustainability ought to more systematically integrate curriculum reform with approaches to internationalization and digitalization of higher education.

AB  - Previous studies have investigated the spatial attributes of Active Learning Classrooms (ALCs) and their impact on students' learning experiences and learning engagement independently; however, a holistic investigation of the relationship between these attributes and students' learning engagement has not been conducted. This study explored how the spatial attributes of ALCs affect students' learning experiences and learning engagement. An empirical questionnaire was administered to freshmen taking English classes in four different types of ALCs at one university, and 224 valid questionnaires were analyzed. This study provides design insight for future learning environments in ALCs by linking two Likert scales: one rating spatial attributes in ALCs that influence learning experiences, and the other rating students' learning engagement in ALCs. The results revealed that the spatial attributes of ALCs significantly affected the learning experience, specifically instructional interaction, furniture perception, learning support, and physical environment. Among them, instructional interactions and physical environment are the most critical in promoting student learning engagement. The survey findings can help architects design more flexible and sustainable learning environments in the future, supporting university students in developing active and collaborative learning skills, as well as providing better references and beneficial insights for future education for sustainable development.

AB  - Sustainability studies educators in colleges and universities must identify and teach the knowledge, skills, and abilities their graduates will most need to advance sustainability while confronting perhaps the most serious, sweeping, and integrated set of challenges humanity has ever known. Using a rigorous grounded theory and hermeneutics based analysis/synthesis of the relevant literature, this study articulates and describes in depth a set of five competencies for the sustainability field and suggests potentially effective pedagogies for teaching them. Findings in the areas of both competencies and pedagogies for sustainability education imply the benefits of integrative, active, collaborative, and applied approaches to curriculum development and teaching-approaches that directly involve students in learning and practicing transdisciplinary engagement in service to sustainability. The Bachelor of Arts in Sustainability Studies program at Colorado Mountain College serves as an example of how the articulated competency framework is being applied to evaluate and enhance curriculum and learning outcomes. The competency framework and pedagogical recommendations offered may also serve as roadmaps for educators at other institutions who prepare graduates to address the pressing challenges of sustainability evident in communities, nations, and the world.

AB  - One major aim of student education is the integration of students in research and development projects for a sustainable development especially in master and Ph.D. programs. Sustainability research should be based on a transdisciplinary approach in order to reach the aim of shaping real processes into a sustainable society. Due to the high complexity of the problem statement as well as the various perspectives of the related stakeholders concerning everyday life and scientific problems, for evaluating transdisciplinary research projects appropriate methods and procedures are required. Through the realization of the evaluation, factors of success can be determined. The paper is going to introduce different methods that can be sub-classified into process evaluation and performance evaluation. Process evaluation looks at the research process itself whereas performance evaluation assesses the results and benefits in comparison with the everyday life problem. Both methods will be applied on a case study for sustainable regional development. Thereby, the integration of heterogeneous stakeholders in the evaluation process will be of particular importance.

AB  - This paper examines a study programme in 'Sustainability and social innovation' at the University of Luxembourg that was cocreated with key external stakeholders in local sustainability transitions. The programme's aim is to equip scientists and citizens for the practice of transformative sustainability science to change human environment interactions. Addressing socially salient, complex problems invites a re-conception of what role universities can play in knowledge production processes in more applied and local contexts. We critically discuss the programme's ambition to provide a platform for transformative social learning for sustainability and to contribute to fostering systemic change in Luxembourg. We deduce design requisites to achieve these ambitions. The paper also discusses the role of different forms of evaluation in effecting individual, programme and systemic change. Research insights were drawn from documentary and literature research, concept-building, programme implementation, observation, analysis, and evaluation by students and contributors.

AB  - Faced with a rapidly changing healthcare environment, primary care practices often have to change how they practice medicine. Yet change is difficult, and the process by which practice improvement can be understood and facilitated has not been well elucidated. Therefore, we developed a model of practice change using data from a quality improvement intervention that was successful in creating a sustainable practice improvement. A multidisciplinary team evaluated data from the Study To Enhance Prevention by Understanding Practice (STEP-UP), a randomized clinical trial conducted to improve the delivery of evidence-based preventive services in 79 northeastern Ohio practices. The team conducted comparative case-study analyses of high- and low-improvement practices to identify variables that are critical to the change process and to create a conceptual model for the change.
   The model depicts the critical elements for understanding and guiding practice change and emphasizes the importance of these elements' evolving interrelationships. These elements are (1) motivation of key stakeholders to achieve the target for change; (2) instrumental, personal, and interactive resources for change; (3) motivators outside the practice, including the larger healthcare environment and community; and (4) opportunities for change-that is, how key stakeholders understand the change options. Change is influenced by the complex interaction of factors inside and outside the practice. Interventions that are based on understanding the four key elements and their interrelationships can yield sustainable quality improvements in primary care practice.

AB  - Nowadays, agriculture businesses have been significantly impacted by rapid global changes, compelling the agro-industry to adopt sustainable development practices to remain resilient. Moreover, the application of stakeholder theory has become essential in business management to achieve inclusive growth and fulfill sustainable business. Understanding the interlink between stakeholder pressure and the motivation to transform an enterprise's practices into sustainable development is imperative. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the direct pressure of stakeholder groups on sustainable practices in agriculture enterprises in Thailand through a questionnaire survey. This paper focused on the influence of primary and secondary stakeholders and evaluated the weighting of sustainability practices. The survey was conducted on employees who work in enterprises that apply Thailand's Sufficiency Economy Philosophy (SEP). The research adopted the regression and information entropy methods for result analysis. The results showed that employees, shareholders, and competitors are significant stakeholder groups that drive sustainable capital covering economics, nature, society, and human capital. Last, stakeholder management is an outstanding practice in a SEP thinking enterprise. Concurrently, human capital is the highest priority to fulfill this alternative pathway to be successful in enterprise sustainability.

KW  - Conceptual framework
AB  - To accelerate the transition towards inclusive, ecological, just and economically viable food systems, insights into appropriate governance models and principles are needed. This article aims to understand how food system governance is linked to and can contribute to sustainability. A review of 34 articles addressed food system governance, sustainability, current barriers and potential solutions. Some authors propose new, participatory, collaborative and democratic governance models to achieve a sustainable food system transition. Other authors consider a lack of integrated policies across sectors and siloed governance major barriers to holistic sustainability agendas and food system approaches. Three main elements of governance emerged from the reviewed literature: (i) interactions between actors, (ii) control and power balances, and (iii) (in)formal rules. Our analysis provides a fourth element: the orchestration of (multiple) food systems and policies. These four elements are integrated into a novel conceptual framework for consistently researching food systems governance for sustainability. The latter is now defined as 'the continuous process of orchestration of policies and (multiple) food systems consisting of diverse interacting actors, respecting (in)formal rules and striving to provide food for all, in equitable and environmentally-friendly ways, at any time and in any context'.

AB  - PurposeThis quantitative study, rooted in the resource-based view (RBV) theory, aims to investigate the relationships among green transformational leadership, green process innovation, employee environmental beliefs and firm environmental performance in Italian manufacturing companies. This study unfolds a nuanced narrative of how strategic green transformational leadership, coupled with environmentally conscious processes, can synergistically enhance an organization's overall environmental performance.Design/methodology/approachThe multi-item survey questionnaire used in this study was distributed to leaders in a diverse sample of Italian companies. A total of 296 valid responses were obtained from the surveys. The collected data were analysed using statistical methods such as correlation, confirmatory factor and structural equation modelling using SPSS software.FindingsThe direct influence of green transformational leadership on firm environmental performance is supported. It also confirms the positive impact of green process innovation on environmental outcomes. It identifies green process innovation as a mediator between green transformational leadership and firm environmental performance, and employee environmental beliefs moderate the link between green transformational leadership and firm environmental performance.Research limitations/implicationsThis research contributes by advancing understanding within the RBV framework by elucidating the specific mechanisms through which green transformational leadership programs promote green process innovation, enhance environmental performance for organizational success, achieve sustainability goals and foster collaboration and stakeholder engagement.Practical implicationsThis study emphasizes the significance of establishing green leadership programs, encouraging green process innovation and systematically monitoring environmental performance to accomplish organizational success and sustainability goals.Originality/valueThis study presents a novel and original examination by integrating the RBV theory on the relationships between green transformational leadership, green process innovation and firm environmental performance, shedding new light on the role of employee environmental beliefs.

AB  - Nature's contributions to people (NCP) support human well-being in multiple ways and are provided through an interplay of natural and anthropogenic capitals. This process is also known as NCP co-production. NCP and the capitals that co-produce them are subject to formal and informal institutions in governance settings across spatial, temporal, and administrative scales. Recent research has shown how scientific literature has studied the governance of anthropogenic capitals in the co-production of NCP. Here we build on this research by exploring challenges and highlighting research gaps and challenges. These include conceptual gaps, such as defining what makes NCP co-production sustainable and differentiating social capital from governance. Second, gaps regarding research practices such as increasing inclusivity of stakeholders. Third, thematic gaps include the understanding of power in polycentric governance of co-produced NCP and the identification of leverage points in a transformation towards sustainable forms of NCP co-production. By identifying these gaps, we explore how future research could deepen the understanding of the interplay between natural and anthropogenic capitals in NCP co-production and thus contribute to more sustainable management practices.

AB  - This paper analyses the development of a collaborative relationship between one academic and one educational development professional (EDP). The paper aims to assist academics and EDPs to establish successful long-term collaborations. Improving the success of such collaborations is important because the adoption of technology enabled learning and teaching materials in higher education requires academics and EDPs to collaborate successfully over extended periods. Despite the critical importance of successful collaborations between academics and EDPs, even well intentioned collaborations are subject to high rates of failure. In addition, existing guidance in the literature has thus far been unable to improve this situation successfully. This paper uses an autoethnographic research approach to analyse the development of a successful collaboration between one academic and one EDP over time. The paper's findings highlight the existence of a small set of key success factors, as well as the change in the relative importance of these factors during the lifespan of the collaboration. The paper is valuable for academics, EDPs, and higher education managers because it provides practical evidence-based guidance that supports the creation of successful and sustainable collaborative working relationships between academics and EDPs.

AB  - Currently, poverty, climate change, environmental pollution and the depletion of natural resources have generated a greater concern for sustainability. The objective is the survival of the human species and the persistence of all components of the biosphere. To achieve sustainability, human participation is essential; sustainable consumption depends on consumers' perceptions of sustainability and how they affect their behavior. The aim of this study was to understand consumers' perceptions and attitudes towards food sustainability based on country, age, gender, income and education level. An online survey was carried out in countries in Europe, America and Asia. Consumers were asked questions organized into food categories. The results showed that consumers' attitude towards sustainability is understood differently in each country, even within the same food category. Consumers with lower education level showed the lowest knowledge and concern about food sustainability. Older generations were less aware of sustainability and its related problems. While income level presented unclear results, gender did not affect attitude towards food sustainability. Therefore, to achieve a sustainable future, raising awareness among the population is increasingly necessary. Consequently, segmenting training campaigns according to the group they are aimed at will provide a greater impact and, therefore, greater awareness.

AB  - In the context of a rapidly changing higher education landscape, and an evolving world of work, no less so in the global South, universities and industry are looking for new ways to collaborate to achieve sustainable and relevant educational solutions. The case explored in this chapter is situated in architectural education in South Africa, where the aim of the collaboration was not to produce research, artefacts or profit. Instead, the university-industry collaboration (UIC) was motivated by the shared pursuit of demographic transformation of the architectural profession. Using a critical action research approach, the authors reflect on the collaboration of Cape Peninsula University of Technology with Open Architecture, a non-profit educational transformation unit linked to the South African Institute of Architects. The authors show that industry can play a catalytic role where university systems fall short, to implement educational innovation for transformation. This case revealed a different kind of bi-directional educational UIC-one that follows an organic process which relies on the informal social interactions between the organisations, and the unique contributions of the individuals and teams involved-producing results that would not be possible through the individual efforts of the respective collaborators.

AB  - This paper documents a collaborative, multi-site participatory action research project in collaboration with children to act on climate change within local community settings. The project was an after-school program that combined hands-on climate change educational activities with photovoice, a participatory action research method that uses digital photography as the basis for problem identification, group dialogue, and social change action. Grounded in transformative sustainability learning theory and integrated with an arts-based participatory action research methodology, the program was designed to strengthen children's climate change awareness and sense of agency through youth-led action projects. After describing the program, this article details the collaborative action projects designed and carried out by 10- to 12-year-olds in each community (e.g., policy advocacy, tree-planting, community garden) as well as how the program facilitated children's constructive climate change engagement through children's enjoyment and agentic action. The critical importance of participatory process and collaborative action in strengthening children's sense of agency is discussed.

AB  - Our study aimed at understanding the utilization of research knowledge generated in sustainable development research. Drawing on a sample of 54 recent research projects, we investigated how and by whom the knowledge was used, what changes were achieved, and how non-academic actors were involved. As a conceptual framework we combined a concept of "stages of knowledge utilization" with a spiral model that co-creates three forms of knowledge - systems knowledge, target knowledge, and transformation knowledge, and which spans from joint problem definition to concrete sustainability transformations. We analysed questionnaires from 94 academic and non-academic actors using cross-tabulation, chi-squared tests, and qualitative content analysis. The early involvement of non-academic actors from key groups such as local enterprises was positively related to the utilization of research knowledge, as was their involvement in diverse roles. However, only little of the research knowledge generated has so far resulted in changes in policy and practice, partly because sustainability transformations are larger societal processes. Utilization of research knowledge for sustainability transformations cannot be achieved without employing a transdisciplinary approach that brings together academic and nonacademic actors in a setting that enables discussions on an even footing and the empowering of actors who are often not heard. In such settings, researchers are also part of the change rather than mere observers, an additional factor that came up in our participatory results validation activities and that requires further research. For more influence on policies and practice, research for development requires active participation of nonacademic actors from the outset, when the project contents are defined.

AB  - How can academicians who desire a sustainable future successfully participate in transdisciplinary projects? Transcending our hidden thought patterns is required. Paradoxically, the disciplinary specialization that enabled the industrial era and its metaphors now function to undermine our ability to recognize and participate in the transformational learning that is needed. In this paper, we offer a post-industrial era metaphor for transdisciplinarity-that of complex dynamic system-that has helped us to work through the unexpected experiences encountered in the process of transformative learning. These insights are based on an ongoing transdisciplinary research collaboration (2008-present) using action research methods; we focus on the faculty experience. Accepting the metaphors of complex systems, we describe the systemic conditions that seem to repeatedly reproduce the emergence of transformative learning for participants, as well as what one might expect to experience in the process. These experiences include: conflict, existential crisis, transformation and renewed vitality within the necessary context of a safe and caring community. Without the adoption of complexity metaphors, these elements would have been overlooked or interpreted as a hindrance to the work. These insights are intended to serve as socially robust knowledge to support the effective participation of faculty members in sustainability projects of a transdisciplinary nature.

AB  - As societal challenges grow, so does the role of universities in finding social and technological solutions. Technical universities are prominent in educating future innovators and developing desired technological and social change. This paper seeks to identify commonalities and better understand differences to develop strategies for mutual support and exchange of best practices. The methodological approach focuses on three questions concerning 1) the common understanding of transdisciplinary, 2) the diversity of transdisciplinary approaches to sustainable development, and 3) the different institutional structures that enable and promote transdisciplinary approaches to sustainability. The qualitative exploratory research suggests that a higher level of societal engagement in scientific research positively impacts societal transformation towards sustainability. This research is also a first step towards making transdisciplinary research at technical universities more visible and transparent to provide better support and create a mutual learning environment for discussing and continuously developing strategies for organizational change.

AB  - The present study examines the evolution of ecological footprint research using bibliometric analysis methods such as performance analyses, science mapping, and bibliographic coupling with the help of VOSviewer and R studio software tools. These methodical approaches help us unveil prominent authors, journals and countries, most cited studies, and key thematic clusters within this domain, which shape the discourse and emphasize the essential role of analytical tools in comprehending environmental impacts. Out of seven thematic clusters identified by bibliographic coupling, sustainability stands out as the most prominent, which indicates the growing interest of researchers in studies related to SDGs, local sustainability strategies, and environmental sustainability. Renewable energy adoption, sustainable and ecotourism framework, and convergence analysis are among other prominent themes, which collectively highlight the critical role of community and stakeholder engagement to develop effective sustainability strategies to achieve ecological balance and human well-being. The cluster related to innovation efficiency emerges as an underdeveloped domain, urging further scholarly attention for future research by incorporating regional economic characteristics and innovation dynamics into ecological footprint research to develop innovative strategies. Overall, current scholarly inquiry provides an overview of ecological footprint research and its temporal evolution, along with guidance for future investigations.

AB  - Objectives The success of National Public Health Institutes (NPHIs) in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) is critical to countries' ability to deliver public health services to their populations and effectively respond to public health emergencies. However, empirical data are limited on factors that promote or are barriers to the sustainability of NPHIs. This evaluation explored stakeholders' perceptions about enabling factors and barriers to the success and sustainability of NPHIs in seven countries where the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has supported NPHI development and strengthening. Design Qualitative study. Setting Cambodia, Colombia, Liberia, Mozambique, Nigeria, Rwanda and Zambia. Participants NPHI staff, non-NPHI government staff, and non-governmental and international organisation staff. Methods We conducted semistructured, in-person interviews at a location chosen by the participants in the seven countries. We analysed data using a directed content analysis approach. Results We interviewed 43 NPHI staff, 29 non-NPHI government staff and 24 staff from non-governmental and international organisations. Participants identified five enabling factors critical to the success and sustainability of NPHIs: (1) strong leadership, (2) financial autonomy, (3) political commitment and country ownership, (4) strengthening capacity of NPHI staff and (5) forming strategic partnerships. Three themes emerged related to major barriers or threats to the sustainability of NPHIs: (1) reliance on partner funding to maintain key activities, (2) changes in NPHI leadership and (3) staff attrition and turnover. Conclusions Our findings contribute to the scant literature on sustainability of NPHIs in LMICs by identifying essential components of sustainability and types of support needed from various stakeholders. Integrating these components into each step of NPHI development and ensuring sufficient support will be critical to strengthening public health systems and safeguarding their continuity. Our findings offer potential approaches for country leadership to direct efforts to strengthen and sustain NPHIs.

AB  - The increasing importance of Earth observation information for society and environment, particularly in the expanding domain of hyperspectral remote sensing, along with the significantly increasing data availability, emphasizes the demand for online education to address the growing need for expertise in this domain. We present a comprehensive review of existing online education programs on Earth observation that underline the limited availability of online resources for hyperspectral remote sensing. To respond to this demand, we introduce HYPERedu, an online education program on hyperspectral remote sensing that has been developed as part of the EnMAP satellite mission since 2019. The program 's core components, content, and participation statistics, along with insights from participant feedback, are presented. HYPERedu offers a wide range of resources, including slide collections, tutorials, video screencasts, and online courses, making them accessible to a broad audience for university teaching, training schools and individual learning. The program 's effectiveness as well as challenges and insights encountered during program development are discussed. We emphasize the importance of collaborative learning, sustainability efforts for long-term material accessibility and quality assurance, and the need to bridge the digital divide with offline options, opensource tools, and multilingual content. Effective content presentation is vital, focusing on consistent branding, concise modules, interactive features, and narrative -style videos. Additionally, we explore the future of online Earth observation learning, considering enhanced participant interaction and the integration of new learning concepts. Finally, we underscore the significance of outreach and training for satellite mission utilization and advocate for open education to promote open science, data, software, and accessibility for inclusive education.

AB  - In the uncertain entrepreneurial ecosystem, scholarly knowledge is bounded by the sustainable growth of entrepreneurial enterprises. Moreover, there is a lack of consensus in academic circles on the relationship between entrepreneurial experience and entrepreneurial performance. In adopting the meta-analysis method, we found a significant relationship between entrepreneurial experience and entrepreneurial performance based on an investigation of 45 independent samples (N = 18,752). We also examined theoretically derived moderators of this relationship referring to firm age, industry condition and experience type to test whether the moderating effects can explain the inconsistent research results on the relationship between entrepreneurial experience and entrepreneurial performance. The relationship was stronger for the high-tech industry than for low-tech industry, for the early business stage than for late business stage and for start-up experience compared to management experience, work experience and industry experience. Our research findings are meaningful for practitioners to achieve sustainable growth by better preserving and coordinating entrepreneurial experience in a dynamic environment. Further, these findings are also important for future research to analyze the factors triggering the heterogeneity of entrepreneurial experience and to investigate the extent to which the start-up experience is more capable of promoting entrepreneurial performance.

AB  - Co-design approach is increasingly popular in many organizations that address global change and social sustainability challenges, thanks to its unique and diverse methods of engaging relevant people in design processes and decision-making. However, the social distancing led by the COVID-19 pandemic seriously problematized the traditional in-person co-design activities. A sustainable online transition is unprecedentedly pressing. By acknowledging the limitations of online co-design, i.e., lack of means for participant engagement, we argue that gamification holds great promise for online co-design. This paper presents an empirical study to investigate this potential qualitatively. Based on the data collected from three gamified online co-design implementations, we examine the benefits of gamification and how future activities should be designed and implemented from the participants' perspectives. Based on the participants' perceptions, we propose several recommendations for designing impactful gamification. The finding suggests that gamification can facilitate online co-design activities in an enjoyable, relaxing, structuring, and creative manner, since they are perceived and recognized by the participants. Moreover, the successful implementation of online co-design implies that great sustainability benefits can be achieved through online transition, i.e., reducing paper consumption and time spent on meetings and unproductive discussions, supporting extensive diversity and density in representation. Online can enable this by overcoming not only the geographic and time limitations but also relevant social issues.

AB  - 3 Meaningful collaboration among heterogeneous stakeholders is essential for achieving sustainability in agri-food supply chains. A substantial amount of research has been focused on examining factors that are critical in shaping characteristics and effectiveness of collaboration in sustainable supply chains from various perspectives. The divergence of such studies and their findings, however, has led to a great proliferation of collaboration behavioural factors proposed. As much as contributing to understanding, different terms and definitions of similar concepts or nature introduced in the literature often also add too much confusion of agri-food supply chain stakeholders in interpreting, evaluating and improving collaboration behaviour. So far, there is lack of a structured analysis on commonalities among those behavioural factors to cluster or consolidate for enhanced clarity and efficiency in assessing and managing collaboration performance toward sustainable agri-food supply chains. Aimed to address such a limitation, this paper applies a systematic review to investigate the landscape of extant literature via the lenses of Resource Dependency Theory and Content Analysis. As a result, 10 key behavioural factors to enable an effective collaboration system for sustainable agri-food supply chain management are identified, which are Joint Efforts, Sharing Activities, Collaboration Value, Adaptation, Trust, Commitment, Power, Continuous Improvement, Coordination and Stability. The findings from this study can be used as a guideline for future research in agri-food supply chain collaboration and help to model and measure collaboration performance more effectively and efficiently.

AB  - Facing rising financial pressure due to economic stagnation and lacklustre engagement from policy-makers, higher education institutions (HEIs) and local communities are placing increasing emphasis on cooperative efforts between universities and communities to co-create positive societal change in the face of the triple planetary crisis. Based on the PRISMA method, this systematic literature review seeks to contribute to the academic knowledge on Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) governance at the local level by unpacking the contribution of HEI-community cooperative approaches to transformative learning and action for sustainability. In order to successfully incorporate communities' priorities in the local-level integration of the SDGs, it is crucial that these new collaborative initiatives foster transformative learning approaches to Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) in an equitable, intersubjective, and inductive manner. The findings present the various strategies used to build long-term, impactful, and resilient learning skills for sustainable development for all ESD stakeholders at the local level, including communities, HEIs, and city authorities. This review proposes these interventions as tools for better local governance towards the integration of the SDGs into HEIs and communities, specifically through SDG4 Quality Education.

AB  - Sustainable business development is connected with environmental impact, natural resources and people. This makes the location a crucial factor for the operation of a business. Therefore, a combination of both geo-spatial data analysis and traditional economic evaluation of companies are advantageous. The consideration of geolocation is beneficial with calculations for process optimizations and cost efficiency as well as ecological and social compliance. Since integrating geospatial methods into economics is a rather new interdisciplinary approach, it seems necessary to establish innovative teaching concepts for the education of experts in this field. Creating and testing such new teaching concepts based on playful learning is the idea behind the ERASMUS+ project SPATIONOMY ( "Spatial exploration of economic data-methods of interdisciplinary analytics "). An interdisciplinary team of teachers educates an interdisciplinary assembled group of international students. Hence, the fields of economics/business informatics and geography/geomatics are represented by participants and staff. Based on initial lessons about basic knowledge in the connected subjects, the central elements of the teaching concept are case studies and a simulation game, each with interdisciplinary challenges. The principal aim of the project-to educate students to become specialists in spatial economics-could be achieved. This paper aims to present, evaluate and discuss the methodological approach as well as the results from the application of the simulation game. The results show that the gamification of education is worthy. Simulation game-based learning appears to be more playful and experiential compared to traditional teaching approaches. Further research in this area should focus on the students' engagement evaluation and attitude towards sustainable behaviour in their own business.

AB  - Extant research into the efficacy of-especially interdisciplinary-higher education for sustainable development (HESD) is limited. A need exists to investigate students' development of sustainability knowledge, attitudes, and behaviours. Furthermore, universities have experienced difficulties implementing interdisciplinary HESD because of organisational barriers due to monodisciplinary structures, as well as educators' and students' reservations. This study introduces an interdisciplinary approach to HESD and investigates its efficacy regarding students' development of sustainability knowledge, attitudes, and behaviours at a university in Germany. The approach applies a series of lectures by different sustainability experts accompanied by several tutorials that support students' interdisciplinary learning and teamwork towards an interdisciplinary sustainability product. Tutors were trained in interdisciplinary teaching methods, as well as interdisciplinary communication and conflict management, beforehand. Before participating in the interdisciplinary course, the students had a moderate level of sustainability knowledge and behaviour, and a high level of sustainability attitudes. The results from the pre-post-test analysis indicate an increase in students' sustainability knowledge and behaviours, and no change in students' sustainability attitudes. If typical barriers to interdisciplinarity are mitigated, interdisciplinary HESD can facilitate students' development.

AB  - This introduction to the special feature describes the development and application of a "full-spectrum sustainability" evaluation framework that emerged from a transdisciplinary research process. The framework and corresponding case studies described in this paper originated in the work of a Canadian Fisheries Research Network project that sought to enhance fisheries management by including diverse social-ecological considerations in fisheries management evaluation. The first section discusses the tendency of sustainability evaluation frameworks in fisheries to focus on ecological and economic considerations and introduces the Canadian Fisheries Research Network's four pillar approach, which includes ecological, economic, social and cultural, and institutional/governance categories. To illustrate the comprehensive nature of this framework, the second section provides a comparison of the framework with elements in the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals. The third section provides an overview of the eight papers in this special feature that explore the development and application of full-spectrum sustainability. The conclusion synthesizes some key findings, highlighting four overall critical and ongoing challenges associated with advancing full-spectrum sustainability evaluation in Canada and elsewhere: the politics of transdisciplinary research; integrating social considerations into management agencies reluctant to move beyond ecological and economic considerations; dynamic and diverse issues involved in supporting robust and inclusive governance processes; and translating technical frameworks into usable practical instruments for different societal actors.

AB  - Purpose - This study aims to delve into the evolution, trends and implications of scientific production related to service learning (SL) and community engagement for sustainability in higher education institutions (HEIs). Because HEIs play a crucial role in achieving the sustainable development goals (SDGs), experiential learning approaches are needed to actively involve students in sustainable development. Design/methodology/approach - In total, 869 publications from Web of Science and Scopus databases were analysed using a bibliometric approach that included performance analysis and science mapping. Subsequently, a systematic literature review was conducted on 118 publications, focusing on their contribution to SDGs and alignment with United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organisation's fields of expertise. Findings - The findings reveal two significant trends: a substantial shift from curriculum development (2000-2010) to education for sustainable development (2011-2022), and the effectiveness of experiential learning teaching approaches, such as the integration of SL with community engagement and the use of innovative research methods in promoting the acquisition of sustainable development competencies. Additionally, community-based research, participatory action research and capacity development emerged as the primary topics. Research limitations/implications - While this research is based on publications from two prominent databases, it may not include significant studies published in other databases.

AB  - In recent decades, cleaner production has received increasing attention since it can contribute to achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including poverty reduction, sustainable consumption and production, and climate change mitigation. This study aims to use the Life Cycle Assessment-ReSOLVE method to find and quantify the main environmental impacts that happen along the production chain. It will also look at how each production stage contributes to these effects and then discuss ways to fix these problems using the circular economy approach and the ReSOLVE framework in the case study. Although this study used a mushroom -growing facility in the Central Highlands of Vietnam as a case study, the approach can be applied to other industries and countries worldwide. The LCA helped identify environmental hotspots, which were areas with significant environmental impact. The data on these hotspots were used to evaluate the ReSOLVE framework to determine appropriate circular practices for improving mushroom cultivation ' s environmental impacts. The results showed that electricity consumption and plastic baskets are the primary hotspots for environmental impacts, especially greenhouse gas emissions. Greenhouse gas emissions while growing shiitake mushrooms ( Lenti- nula edodes ) were 2.38 kg CO 2 e/kg mushroom, of which energy use contributes to 72.87% of the emissions. The evaluation findings obtained from the ReSOLVE framework indicate that the facility is now implementing 17 out of 42 circular practices. The facility significantly prioritizes process optimization, implementing eight practices, and places a strong emphasis on regeneration, implementing five practices. According to the study ' s findings, practitioners should adopt this approach to support businesses in achieving sustainable development. Practitioners should tailor the circular practices in the ReSOLVE framework to the industry in which they evaluate and implement the suggested circular economy solutions to assess the effectiveness of using both the ReSOLVE framework and CE solutions. Moreover, this study only focused on a mushroom facility as a case study. Consequently, we want to enhance the methodology and extend this approach to other sectors in future research.

AB  - Despite widespread interest in science communication, public engagement with science, and engaged research, a large gap exists between the theories behind science engagement and how it is practiced within the scientific community. The scholarship of science engagement is also fractured, with knowledge and insights fragmented across discourses related to science communication, informal science learning, participatory research, and sustainability science. In the present article, we share a planning tool for integrating evidence and theory from these discourses into effective programs and projects. The ECO framework promotes three distinct and interacting modes of science engagement practice: formative engagement (listening and relationship building), codesign and coproduction (action-oriented partnerships), and broader outreach (expanding networks and dissemination). By planning engagement activities with attention to these three modes of engagement, scientists and scientific research organizations will be better poised to address urgent needs for stronger connections between science and society and increased use of scientific research in decision-making.

AB  - It is crucial to review cases where heritage works as a means of empowering sustainable communities through participative governance and learn from these mechanisms. This paper aims to explore the lessons of participative governance in Agua Blanca, a small village located on the Ecuadorian coast, where heritage -archeological remains and dry tropical forests- constitutes the primary resource. The approach is qualitative, and the methods were archive analysis, observation, and open interviews. The villagers lead participative management that is based on equality of the access and distribution of resources. Through this vision, collective economic benefits from their heritage are achieved. Besides, the dwellers reinforce their identity through their cultural and natural heritage, which contributes to its preservation. Nevertheless, Ague Blanca faces challenges as the indifference of younger generations, territorial segregation, and the lack of relationships with government organisms. To confront these obstacles, it is recognized that the community is not a stable and permanent system but rather a set of difficulties that are overcome through inclusive governance mechanisms that evolve in the face of new necessities.

AB  - This research paper evaluates the commitment, attitude, and performance of various stakeholders, particularly the local government authorities, academic institutions, local businesses, media, and private sector, in the sustainable development of tourism villages. Quantitative data were collected through a survey questionnaire to gather perceptions and feedback from 384 tourism awareness group leaders in the province of West Sumatra, Indonesia. This study employs Partial Least Squares-Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) to test the hypotheses. The findings indicate that stakeholders' commitment, attitude, and performance exert a strong influence on sustainable tourism villages. In addition, community culture moderates the relationship between the attitudes of stakeholders and sustainable tourism villages as opposed to the stakeholders' commitment and performance. These findings provide valuable insights and far-reaching consequences for stakeholders, tourism village heads, and the community. There is a need to continuously enhance a comprehensive plan for sustainable tourism, one that goes beyond cultural implication and incorporates a broader range of influencing factors.

AB  - The potential of online collaborative learning has been recognized in teacher education, and the value student teachers? collective agency in predict their sustainable professional develop has been discussed. However, there is limited understanding of how student teachers? collaborative knowledge construction behaviors correlate with their collective agency. This study investigated one class of student teachers? collaborative knowledge construction behavioral pattern in a multi-layered interaction activity, and further explained their correlation with the participants? collective agency. A total of 50 third-year student teachers from a class of a university in central China participated in the study. The results suggested that in terms of the average density, both intragroup and intergroup interaction networks were high-density ones. However, the number of interactions within each group was uneven. The student teachers had different reciprocity in intragroup and intergroup discussions. Their social knowledge construction behavioral patterns showed different characteristics in different stages of the multi-layered interaction activity. The questionnaire survey and interview data further revealed that though the student teachers built up collaborative learning awareness to some extent, their collective agency still has space to be improved. The authors conclude with some insights into the online collaborative learning in sustainable teachers? professional development.

AB  - The Maine Tidal Power Initiative (MTPI), an interdisciplinary team of engineers, marine scientists, oceanographers, and social scientists, is using a transdisciplinary sustainability science approach to collect biophysical and social data necessary for understanding interactions between human and natural systems in the context of tidal power development in Maine. MTPI offers a unique opportunity to better understand how group structure and process influence outcomes in transdisciplinary sustainability science research. Through extensive participant observation and semi-structured interviews we: (1) describe MTPI's organizational structure; (2) examine MTPI's research approach and engagement with stakeholders from different sectors of society (i.e., industry, government, and the local community); and (3) identify challenges and opportunities for involving different disciplinary expertise and diverse stakeholders in transformational sustainability science research. We found that MTPI's holistic mission, non-hierarchical structure, and iterative stakeholder engagement process led to important benefits and significant challenges. Positive outcomes include knowledge development, a transferable research framework, shared resources, personal reward, and a greater understanding of the local environment and community. Challenges identified include balancing diverse interests and priorities, maintaining engagement, managing stakeholder relationships, and limited resources. Lessons learned from the process of integrative collaborative research in Maine can offer guidance on what should be considered when carrying out similar transdisciplinary sustainability science projects in other research contexts.

Design/methodology/approach Questionnaire survey of principal stakeholders involved in construction project delivery within client, consulting and contracting organisations in Nigeria were conducted to assess stakeholders' perspectives on the decisive factors for achieving sustainable procurement in construction projects using importance weights. A total of 243 questionnaires were distributed and a response rate of 51% (123 questionnaires were adequately filled and returned) was achieved. Descriptive and inferential statistics were utilised in analysing elicited data. Findings The results from data analysis showed that "satisfaction - including workforce satisfaction and user satisfaction", "value for money" and "creating a healthy, nontoxic environment - including high indoor air quality" were the top most three decisive factors for achieving sustainable procurement in construction projects in Nigeria. Originality/value An understanding of these decisive factors can help principal stakeholders in the construction industry of developing countries to facilitate the development of methods required in supporting the adoption of sustainable procurement practice.

AB  - This paper explores the development of community engagement work in the heritage sector and the danger of such projects conforming to a top-down model. An alternative community-driven approach is explored. The ongoing Bendigo heritage engagement project is used as a basis for discussing the benefits, limitations and potential pitfalls of such an approach. The role of the project manager in negotiating the politics and issues arising in community-driven approaches is crucial and a range of skills and techniques, which may assist those in this role, are highlighted. Identifying and addressing potential problem areas is essential to ensure the success of such projects. This is imperative if museums, galleries or other organisations wish to move beyond rhetorical strategies for community engagement towards successful implementation of sustainable and relevant projects that positively contribute to local communities.

AB  - > Context . Sustainability is among major societal goals in our days. Education is acknowledged as an essential strategy for attaining sustainability by activating the creative potential within young people to understand sustainability, bring forth changes in their everyday life, and collectively envision a more sustainable future.> Problem . However, teaching and learning about sustainability and sustainability-related issues is not an easy task due to the inherent complexity, ambiguity, and context-specificity of the concept. We are in need of innovative pedagogical approaches and tools that will allow us to design learning activities in which learners will be empowered to develop new, alternative interpretations of sustainability in personally and collectively meaningful ways.> Method . We argue that a constructionist perspective involving the use of expressive media for digital storytelling offers an appropriate frame or designing learning activities fostering collaborative creativity in thinking and learning about urban sustainability. Our study is based on the design of a learning activity following this rationale. We adopted a qualitative approach in the collection and analysis of different sources of data with the aim to explore collaborative creativity as a learning process based on the students collective processes and resulting in the co-construction of new ideas and insights about sustainability, and new tangible artefacts (the digital stories) encompassingthem.> Results . Our analysis of the collaborative creativity exemplified in the three digital stories produced identified important creative elements with regards to the three components of a digital story (script, technical characteristics, and ideas of urban sustainability) and how they were embodied in each digital story produced as a result of the students' joint constructionist activity. > Implications . Our study provides some preliminary evidence that collaborative creativity from a constructionist perspective can stand as an appropriate framework for designing learning activities addressing the difficult concept of sustainability. There are several implications for both theory and educational practice in environmental education and education for sustainable development, constructionism, and digital storytelling in education. Moreover, our study opens up new fields for research and theory in creativity.

AB  - Providing guidelines to the students is central for them to optimize their learning, so as to enhance the effectiveness of their learning. However, one of the contemporary issues debated within the dynamics of learning indicates the decline of instructional strategies, one of which occurs due to the ruling out of ethical consideration in learning. Traditional wisdom plays a role in strengthening ethical considerations needed in the learning process. This article aims to shed light on strategies utilized in dynamics of learning through addressing moral ethics. A critical review of peer-reviewed journals, articles, and books was conducted with special reference to al-Zarnuji's concept in Ta'lim al-Muta'allim. This concept contains several significant guidelines for teaching and learning instructions. The findings revealed that the dynamics of learning requires mechanical aids and rules with ethical consideration on the moral purpose to promote sustainable learning. Learning with holistic approach comprises rightful intention and comprehensive perseverance, which plays a significant role to strengthen ethical engagement in sustainable learning among the students. Finally, this study is expected to contribute to the conceptual framework on the Islamic literature, specifically in relation to sustainable learning by strengthening traditional wisdom.

AB  - Rural tourism development emphasizes economic benefits while considering the needs of various stakeholders to achieve sustainability. This research aims to investigate the sustainable development of rural tourism by establishing a sustainability evaluation model to coordinate the demands of villagers and tourists based on a people-oriented concept. Using villages in the Fuchun River Basin in China as a case study, the study develops a rural tourism satisfaction evaluation system. A Fuzzy Comprehensive Evaluation (FCE) method is then used to evaluate the satisfaction of tourists and villagers. Finally, a two-dimensional evaluation coordinate system is employed to identify various shortcomings. The results are as follows: 1) An imbalance is observed in satisfaction between villagers and tourists. Tourism development in this area mainly focuses on the interests of tourists; thus, the services and facilities provided to villagers are relatively limited. 2) The sustainable development of rural tourism lacks momentum; therefore, efforts should be made to strengthen construction in areas such as sanitation, accommodation, commercialization, folk activities, and communication. 3) The sustainability evaluation method of rural tourism needs to address the different interests of villagers and tourists and establish a system based on indicators of rural characteristics.

AB  - This paper explores the relationship between education for sustainable development (ESD) and interdisciplinarity in the context of architecture and engineering higher education, presenting a case study of the University of Strathclyde Glasgow's Sustainable Engineering (SE) postgraduate programme, within the wider context of common principles and practices present across HEIs. The paper - one of a series - offers an overview of the SE programme between 2004 and 2015 (coinciding with UNDESD) and discusses its growing focus on interdisciplinarity and the introduction of transformative learning methods over the study period. The study uses a methodology of statistical analysis of enrolment and graduation trends on the SE programme alongside a discursive analysis of course and module provision specific to learning methods for ESD and interdisciplinarity. The study finds that, within the SE programme, both the courses and modules that have an SD focus exhibit the greatest longevity over the study period and are selected by students significantly more often than other courses and modules. The finding supports previous studies that report an increased appetite for such courses and classes. The learning methods employed on the modules align with those considered exemplary in the literature surrounding ESD, and demonstrate the programme's aspirations towards increased interdisciplinarity in postgraduate ESD. The paper provides insight into the practices and outcomes of a specific long-standing programme, offering opportunity for reflection, discussion and comparison with similar programmes.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to help researchers and restaurant owners gain an understanding of healthy sustainable initiatives within restaurant businesses. This study applied a content analysis of 93 restaurant chains' websites with a systematic coding procedure. The study identified fifteen healthy sustainable initiatives under a value chain framework, four of which follow value chain dimensions: sourcing, production, marketing, and service. The most frequently mentioned healthy sustainable practice was presenting nutrition-related information, followed by providing healthy menu options and using organic/natural produce. Sit-down restaurants were more likely to engage in healthy sustainable eating initiatives than were fast-food restaurants (e.g., increasing the availability of healthy options, smaller/reduced portion sizes, using fresh and local food, and using healthy cooking methods). This study contributes to the restaurant/foodservice management and food marketing literature by showing a comprehensive picture of what U.S. restaurant chains are doing to promote healthy sustainable eating. The findings can be used as a benchmark tool for practitioners to evaluate and develop healthy sustainable restaurant initiatives and as the foundation of measurement items for scholars.

AB  - Sustainable development and sustainability is desired across societies and nations. However, access to quality education is considered paramount for such to be ensured. This study, through the lenses of scholars, explores the link between quality education, sustainable development and sustainability, using a systematic review approach. Using different key terms, 180 publications were retrieved following the search on SABINET. However, following the application of identified inclusion and exclusion criteria, 55 articles were considered relevant for analysis. The analysed articles were coded, categorised and thematised. The findings of the study showed that factors such as collaboration, institution independence, capacity building programmes, among others are contributory to quality education and by extension sustainable development and sustainability. However, factors like lack of funding, infrastructure, leadership issues, among others hamper the desired quality education, sustainable development and sustainability. The results of the study suggest that collaboration, capacity building programmes as well as institution independence are required to ensure the provision of quality education.

AB  - Researchers have proposed many industrial or national sustainability evaluation indicator systems during the past decade, although there has not yet been a project-level sustainability evaluation system for the evaluation and execution monitoring of the sustainability status for a construction project. Without such an evaluation system, it will be difficult for the planners to plan the sustainable project objectives, for the contractors to select the sustainable execution alternatives, and for the facility managers to operate sustainable constructed facilities. To meet the abovementioned requirements, this paper presents an effort conducted in Taiwan to propose a Construction Project Sustainability Assessing System (CPSAS) considering three pillars of sustainability: environmental, social, and economic, based on the theoretical backgrounds from the literature and former successful sustainable projects. The proposed CPSAS comprises four levels: Level 1,3 main pillars; Level 2, 8 categories; Level 3,19 sub-categories; and Level 4, 31 indicators. Different selections of indicators for application in different project phases are suggested according to the prioritization via questionnaire surveys. A procedure for sustainable project management with the proposed CPSAS is suggested to the project management team. Finally, three green building projects and two civil infrastructure construction projects of Taiwan were tested to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed CPSAS. It is concluded that the proposed CPSAS is useful for construction stakeholders to achieve sustainability more effectively during the execution of a construction project.

AB  - The complexity of sustainable development and societal transitions require both analytical understandings of how coupled human-environment systems function and transdisciplinary science-to-practice approaches. The academic discourse has advanced in developing a framework for defining success in transdisciplinary research (TDR). Further empirical evidence is needed to validate the proposed concepts with TDR case studies. This paper applies a widely used TDR framework to test and critically evaluate its design principles and criteria of success with five TDR case studies the author is intimately familiar with. Overall, the design principles of the framework are validated for the five cases. Additional design principles are derived from the case analysis and proposed to complement the applied framework: (1) A project origin from society as opposed to with and for society; (2) Quickly available initiation funding; (3) Flexibility in time, objectives and methods throughout the research process; (4) Acceptance of process vs. project results; (5) Inclusion of public science communication; and (6) A demand-driven transition to a prolonged or new project partnership. The complementing principles are proposed for integration in the applied framework and are subject to further empirical testing. The reflexive empirical approach I have taken in this paper offers a key step towards removing institutional barriers for successful TDR, demonstrating how conceptual frameworks can be applied.

AB  - Why are we still educating college and university students through a Holocene lens? How can we expect young people to engage with the transformative challenges required to meet the targets of the Paris Agreement when climate change education is organized in a narrow and linear fashion? Climate change courses and teaching modules largely emphasize scientific literacy through a focus on physical processes, documentation of rising emissions, and empirical evidence of a changing climate. Classroom explorations of responses to climate change are often limited to "business-as-usual" policy options, new technologies, and behavioral interventions to reduce emissions or promote adaptation. Such approaches make it difficult for students to recognize the social dimensions of climate change and to identify openings and entry points for sustainability transformations. This Viewpoint contribution argues that it is time to rethink climate change curricula within higher education and adapt it to the Anthropocene. We present an integrative approach to climate change education that focuses on humans as active and reflexive agents of large-scale systems change, incorporates economic, political, cultural, psychological, and emotional dimensions of the issue, and fosters active engagement with transformations to sustainability.

AB  - Over the past two decades, a continuously expanding list of footprint-style indicators has been introduced to the scientific community with the aim of raising public awareness of how humanity exerts pressures on the environment. A deeper understanding of the connections and interactions between different footprints is required in an attempt to support policy makers in the measurement and choice of environmental impact mitigation strategies. Combining a selection of footprints that address different aspects of environmental issues into an integrated system is, therefore, a natural step. This paper starts with the idea of developing a footprint family from which most important footprints can be compared and integrated. On the basis of literature review in related fields, the ecological, energy, carbon, and water footprints are employed as selected indicators to define a footprint family. A brief survey is presented to provide background information on each of the footprints with an emphasis on their main characteristics in a comparative sense; that is, the footprints differ in many aspects more than just the impacts they are addressed. This allows the four footprints to be complementarily used in assessing environmental impacts associated with natural resource use and waste discharge. We evaluate the performance of the footprint family in terms of data availability, coverage complementarity, methodological consistency, and policy relevance and propose solutions and suggestions for further improvement. The key conclusions are that the footprint family, which captures a broad spectrum of sustainability issues, is able to offer a more complete picture of environmental complexity for policy makers and, in particular, in national-level studies. The research provides new insights into the distinction between environmental impact assessment and sustainability evaluation, properly serving as a reference for multidisciplinary efforts in estimating planetary boundaries for global sustainability.

AB  - Numerous scholars are now directing their attention to the education and learning implications of participatory resource and environmental governance because of the potential implications of these for generating the social mobilization necessary to achieve sustainability trajectories. Our work, and that of other researchers, establishes that public participation in environmental assessment (EA) provides fertile ground for considering the intricacies of governance as they relate to participation, and for examining the education and learning implications of participation. Since EA law requires in many cases that public voices be part of the decision process, it has resulted in the creation of fascinating, state-sanctioned, deliberative spaces for civic interactions. Our purpose here is to share, and build upon, a framework that conceptualizes the relationships among participation, education, learning and sustainability in an EA context. We do so by considering findings from studies we have undertaken on participation in EA in Canada since the early 90's. Our approach was interactive and collaborative. We each considered in detail the key results of our earlier work as they relate to education, learning and EA process design. The findings illuminate aspects of the conceptual framework for which there is considerable empirical evidence, such as the link between meaningful participation and critical education and the diversity of individual learning outcomes associated with public participation in EA. The findings also highlight those parts of the framework for which the empirical evidence is relatively sparse, such as the range of possible social learning outcomes, their congruence with sustainability criteria, and the roles of monitoring and cumulative and strategic assessments in shaping EA into an adaptive, learning system.

AB  - As institutions of higher education continue to roll out online courses and programs, issues of undergraduate student readiness on the one hand, and the challenges surrounding the design and development of pedagogically-sound online experiences that are also accessible to students with disabilities on the other, remain of concern. This paper describes the results of a case study of collaboration between the Instructional Design and Technology faculty and the Assistive Technology Initiative (ATI) group at a 4-year public institution to address both of these issues simultaneously during the development of an online course designed to teach undergraduates to cultivate the self-discipline and self-direction required to become successful online learners. The authors of this paper discuss project challenges, particularly concerning accessibility, along with lessons learned from both a process and a student outcome perspective. The authors also share insights into creating sustainable collaborative processes for successful online initiatives. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Water-related crises and disasters are increasing in frequency and severity. Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) has been established over the last few decades aiming to achieve sustainable and participatory water governance. However, this article argues that IWRM is often based on ontological exclusion in the sense that participation is conditional on adopting a dominant ontology of water as a natural resource. Drawing on the Ontological Turn, we present a conceptual framework of ontological inclusion to support the analysis of established water governance. This is engaged in a case study of a participatory process for water-body classification in the Doce River basin. The ontologies of river-as-Wat & uacute;, of the Indigenous Krenak, and river-as-home, of riverine communities, are shown to be excluded from the participatory process; furthermore, the ontologies of river-as-contested and river-as-state-failure are excluded from the policy instrument. The ontologies of river-as-resource and river-as-state-responsibility are enacted in the participatory process and the policy instrument. While state managers expressed concern for participation and plurality, the process and policy instrument remained ontologically exclusive. The nuances of ontological overlap and partial exclusion are explored alongside reflections on the challenges of plurality in state governance. The conceptual framework provides a normative resource for evaluating ontological inclusion and exclusion in established environmental governance.

AB  - There is a need for participatory methods that simultaneously assess agricultural sustainability and resilience at farming system level, as resilience is needed to deal with shocks and stresses on the pathways to more sustainable systems. We present the Framework of Participatory Impact Assessment for Sustainable and Resilient FARMing systems (FoPIA-SURE-Farm). FoPIA-SURE-Farm investigates farming system functioning, dynamics of main indicators, and specifies resilience for different resilience capacities, i.e., robustness, adaptability, and transformability. Three case studies with specialized farming systems serve as an example for the used methodology: starch potato production in Veenkolonien, The Netherlands; dairy production in Flanders, Belgium; and hazelnut production in Lazio, Italy. In all three farming systems, functions that related to food production, economic viability, and maintaining natural resources were perceived as most important. Perceived overall performance of system functions suggest moderate sustainability of the studied farming systems. In the studied systems, robustness was perceived to be stronger than adaptability and transformability. This indicates that finding pathways to higher sustainability, which requires adaptability and transformability, will be a challenging process. General characteristics of farming systems that supposedly convey general resilience, the so-called resilience attributes, were indeed perceived to contribute positively to resilience. Profitability, having production coupled with local and natural resources, heterogeneity of farm types, social self-organization, and infrastructure for innovation were assessed as being important resilience attributes. The relative importance of some resilience attributes in the studied systems differed from case to case, e.g., heterogeneity of farm types. This indicates that the local context in general, and stakeholder perspectives in particular, are important when evaluating general resilience and policy options based on resilience attributes. Overall, FoPIA-SURE-Farm results seem a good starting point for raising awareness, further assessments, and eventually for developing a shared vision and action plan for improving sustainability and resilience of farming systems.

AB  - With the rapid increase of market competition pressure, enterprises' collaborative innovation plays a more prominent role in competitive advantage. This paper aims to explore how the enterprise-science community can achieve sustainable collaborative value co-creation. Taking the Maoduoli Group as a sample, using the single case study method and grounded theory, a structural model of the enterprise-science community collaborative value co-creation mechanism is constructed. The proposed model is based on the value logic of "advocating value-creating value-delivering value-acquiring value", which explains how the enterprise-scientific community collaborative value co-creation model is formed, how it is implemented, how it is delivered to customers, and the overall process of jointly harvesting value at last. The findings are as follows: First, government support, market demand, and entrepreneurial spirit are the internal and external factors for the enterprise-science community to develop collaborative value co-creation; secondly, the synergy mechanism of the enterprise-science community is to realize mutual activities such as joint research and development, a joint publication of papers, sharing of research results, joint research and development activities, and joint teaching practice through means of capital investment, concept support, and technical support. Third, the synergy mechanism of the enterprise-science community can realize the value of the economic and scientific research and the ecological and social benefits (narrow sense), and continuously feed back to further promote a deeper level of collaborative value co-creation of the enterprise-science community. This paper introduces the dimension of the scientific community, forms a special construct, and focuses on the collaborative value co-creation model of the enterprise-scientific community, which fills the gap in this research direction, and also provides theoretical support and practical guidance for the collaborative value co-creation model of the enterprise-scientific community.

AB  - Local economic development (LED) strategies are increasingly being recommended as an alternative or a complement to traditional development strategies. However, beyond a limited number of areas where 'best practices' have been identified, there has been little systematic monitoring of whether LED really works. This paper uses a purpose-built database of 898 municipalities in Mexico in order to assess, using a quantitative approach, whether the implementation of seven different components of LED - development plan, sustainability, entrepreneurship, capacity building, participation mechanisms, development links, and autonomy - has delivered greater human development across Mexican local governments. The results of the analysis indicate that municipalities engaging in LED during the last two decades have witnessed significant improvements in human development, relative to those which have overlooked LED strategies. The increase in human development has been greatest for those local authorities which have pursued capacity building, the establishment of additional development links and which have drafted a development plan. Greater independence from federal or state initiative has, by contrast, been detrimental for changes in human development at the local level. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Teachers working in under-resourced contexts struggle to provide psychosocial support to learners. In this article, we focus on 10 teacher participants' reflections of how a transformative action research process enhanced their collective capacity for initiating sustainable learner support. A linked participatory action learning and action research (PALAR)-life design (LD) process initiated at their school with an LD counsellor, assisted them to provide sustainable support at the school. LD enabled teacher participants to build on personal and professional narratives as a foundation for embarking on the PALAR process to attain positive change. LD deepened their psychological understanding of the link between their past and present, which remained a sustainable motivation throughout the PALAR process. Data generated from transcriptions of action learning group discussions and teacher reflections during the project were thematically analysed. Findings suggest that the PALAR-LD process is suitable to enable the sustained addressing of contextual challenges, through the development of action leadership in teachers. Although the LD process has to be initiated together with an LD counsellor, teachers can then sustain the PALAR process on their own, making it both cost-effective and feasible. The framework has value for enhancing learner support in contexts of social and economic adversity.

KW  - CREATION
AB  - This paper presents a theoretical framework that can be used to discuss the question of how context, time and different participatory process designs influence the results of participatory monitoring projects in terms of concrete outputs (such as sustainability indicators) and the more intangible social outcomes (such as learning and stakeholder relations). We will discuss and compare four different cases of participatory monitoring of provincial sustainable development in the Netherlands. The results show sustainability issues selected by the stakeholders reflect the socio-economic and ecological structural characteristics of their region. In a different context, stakeholders not only assign different weights to the same set of issues, but more importantly they select a completely different set of regional aims altogether. Since these regional structural characteristics only change slowly over time, the influence of time on stakeholder preferences is shown to be only of minor importance. However, the dissipation of learning effects is shown to be a fundamental challenge for the cyclical nature of participatory monitoring, especially when its goal is shared agenda building. Another important conclusion is that, in the design of participatory processes, more attention should be devoted to providing stakeholders with the opportunity to comment on an 'intermediate' product.

TI  - The N2 scrap collectors: assessing the viability of informal recycling using the sustainable livelihoods framework
T2  - COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT JOURNAL
LA  - English
AB  - A group of women in the rural Eastern Cape Province of South Africa earns a living collecting scrap metal and paying to transport it for sale in Durban. The sustainability of their livelihood is in question because of an ever-shrinking supply of recyclable metals, fluctuating commodity prices, and the logistical difficulties of transporting the materials to buyers further along the recycling value chain. Using the sustainable livelihoods framework, this paper highlights the opportunities and challenges facing these informal recyclers. It shows how the women have fashioned a livelihood practice in the context of widespread rural poverty, isolation from recycling markets, and limited community assets. Implications for community development include the need for a participatory sustainable livelihood analysis to evaluate ways to counterbalance the instability and uncertainty involved in informal recycling and to raise the incomes of the women involved in this activity.

AB  - The strategic goal of city management is to ensure its sustainable development which requires a balance of rare resources. From the operational perspective, namely projects implementing sustainable development, the balance refers to human resources. They can be classified into the public or private sector and their cooperation is known as Public-Private Partnership (PPP). Building on the concept of sustainable development and stakeholder theory, the research develops a conceptual framework of stakeholder analysis in PPP projects. More generally, the research aims to contribute to a theoretical understanding of the determinants of sustainable city development and PPP success factors. The research claims that the PPP procurement is consistent with sustainable urban development and the PPP model, accompanied by the stakeholder theory, requires evaluation which balances diverse stakeholders' interests along the triple bottom of sustainable development. The conceptual framework combines stakeholder attributes of preferred benefits and power and urgency. It includes a time and scope perspective. The research has a descriptive but also a normative character as the framework could be helpful to understand and engage stakeholders in sustainable urban development. The developed framework can be considered for the future construction of a model that can be implemented and tested. This theoretical research is based on a literature survey, applying methods of critical analysis and construction. The innovative approach of the research is based on integrated application of already known concepts of sustainable development, stakeholder theory, and Public-Private Partnership, which are all necessary to create a new approach to management of city development consistent with the known facts.

AB  - CONTEXT: To align with SDG 12, emphasizing responsible consumption and production, it has become imperative for the global beef cattle industry to engage in sustainable production. One of the substantial challenges for future beef production is the increasing competition for resources between animal feed and human food. Moreover, there is a pressing need to address the impact of climate change, given that beef cattle production is a major contributor to methane gas emissions. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate beef cattle production across 20 major-beef producing countries from 2011 to 2020 by 1) Assessing total factor productivity. 2) Estimating both technical efficiency and methane efficiency. 3) Estimating potential reduction of resource uses and methane emission. 4) Investigating the relationship between total factor productivity and methane efficiency. METHODS: The assessment utilizes the Malmquist productivity index and data envelopment analysis with an undesirable output. This study considers cattle population, permanent pasture, and labor productivity as inputs, with beef production and methane emissions as desirable and undesirable outputs, respectively. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The results indicate that the annual productivity growth for these 20 countries is 1.3 %, primarily attributed to technological advancements. The technical and methane efficiency scores stand at 0.645 and 0.476, respectively. Overall, the potential reduction in beef cattle, pasture area, and methane emissions are 283,257,995 heads, 933,802,815 ha, and 13,414,544 tons, respectively. There is a positive relationship between total factor productivity and methane efficiency. Moreover, the findings reveal that the US and India demonstrated relatively higher productivity growth and full methane efficiency in their beef cattle production. Accordingly, the US could serve as valuable references for other countries implementing pasture-based systems, while India's approach can be particularly insightful for countries employing smallholder farmer-based systems. SIGNIFICANCE: This study addresses a pressing environmental concern of methane emissions from beef cattle production. Given that beef cattle production is a major contributor to methane gas emissions, estimating methane efficiency of beef cattle production while considering the undesirable output of methane is critical. This study is expected to enrich the existing literature on improving sustainability in beef production and raise collective awareness about reducing greenhouse gas emissions, particularly methane. Ultimately, it will foster collaboration and synergy among stakeholders to achieve sustainable beef production.

AB  - In the face of climate change and other environmental issues, all relevant stakeholders, including members of civil society, should participate in the transformation towards a sustainable future. The project ' Simply make a change ' engaged citizens (n = 101), with the help of an entirely voluntary and individual commitment approach, in a sustainable behavior they had not carried out before (e.g., plastic-free shopping or vegan nutrition). With the help of two questionnaires and subsequent interviews, participants were asked about their experiences with the commitment. The high proportion of participants who voluntarily sustained their chosen activity after the one-week trial run (78%), their rich and differentiated comments, and the formation of competencies such as mindfulness, reflectivity, and feelings of responsibility indicate that the approach was meaningful. Participants would have preferred a longer trial and perceived restrictions in daily life by behaviors with high task-difficulty (vegan nutrition), but felt confident to try out other sustainable behaviors in the future. The present data indicate that a completely voluntary self-commitment can encourage citizens to try out a new behavior and might also lower the threshold for trying other sustainable behaviors. This might contribute, step by step, to a more sustainable society.

AB  - In recent years, cultural sustainability has attracted increasing attention within the discourse of sustainable development and sustainable cities. Notwithstanding some effort put on conceptualizing the relationship between culture and sustainability, research on the issue is still in a pre-paradigmatic stage and related empirical studies are scant. In particular, further knowledge is required to understand not only how cultural sustainability has been addressed strategically but also implemented in practice. In this direction, research has pointed out the role of social structures (e.g., partnerships, collaborations, etc.) for achieving cultural sustainability goals. However, focusing on smart cities, attention is limited to how collaborative arrangements can be leveraged within the development of new city services (e.g., smart open innovation) to sustain goals of environmental, economic and social sustainability, with cultural sustainability still playing a marginal role. This paper develops a new framework linking together the strategic level and the practice level in addressing cultural sustainability and conceptualizing the role of collaborative structures in the development of smart innovation. The framework is then used as a frame of reference for analyzing the case of MuseoTorino, a new city museum realized within the smart city strategy of Turin (Italy). The analysis provides evidence of some practices adopted to leverage collaboration and stakeholders' engagement to strategically address cultural sustainability and to realize it in practice throughout the new service development process.

AB  - Sustainability demonstration projects, which bring emerging technologies closer to large-scale adoption through public-private collaborations, are critical for sustainable development and climate change response. These projects are motivated by knowledge development however immature practices are resulting in missed opportunities for project-to-project learning. This challenge is consistent with cross-domain findings that effective project learning is complex and rare, constrained by temporal, geographical and organisational barriers. A key approach to spanning scale-barriers and community-of-practice boundaries is the externalised sharing of codified learnings within boundary objects, where these objects require structural characteristics that afford project-toproject learning. To date, these characteristics have not been studied in sustainability demonstration contexts, forming a significant research gap. We conduct an integrative review of the cross-domain literature and, as a new contribution to knowledge, propose a reconceptualised 13-characteristic schema for codified boundary objects affording project-to-project learning between sustainability demonstrations. The study advances the theory of knowledge sharing from projects for sustainability by putting boundary object characteristics into context providing insight into enabling and restricting potential along with identifying key research gaps for future research.

AB  - Internationalization is at the core of higher education and institutions are exploring sustainable solutions to develop a comprehensive framework for internationalization. Collaborative Online International Learning (COIL) is a sustainable solution in which two cohorts of faculty and students from geographically and culturally diverse backgrounds can collaborate and interact thereby gaining skills to function in a multicultural and diverse global community. Practices of COIL would help to enhance inclusive and equitable education that would help promote lifelong learning among the beneficiaries. Despite the abundant benefits that COIL offers, research on COIL is still in its nascent stage and is more concentrated in developed high income countries. In this study, the researchers have adopted the bibliometric approach to systematically study the existing literature, explore research gaps and identify emerging research areas in COIL. The results of this analysis would help academicians, researchers, policymakers, and international cells in institutions to strategize and formulate policies to popularize COIL as a sustainable solution for higher education. This would be especially beneficial to developing and emerging economies. The study has theoretical, managerial and societal implications for policy makers, researchers and academicians in higher education institutions.

AB  - Nowadays, collaborative learning is proving to offer solutions to new inclusivity research challenges, and most importantly, can help ensure sustainable education. Collaborative learning can strengthen positive attitudes towards learning, improve performance in academic results, and enhance self-esteem, by promoting interaction and mutual support among young people. Extended reality (XR), associated with collaborative learning, offers a further advantage by facilitating deep comprehensive learning. An online survey was conducted to investigate respondents' views on the impact and influence of virtual technologies on work, study, and social life. Respondents (n= 1032) were recruited from Serbia, Romania, and Hungary, from five public and private universities. The study reveals students' perceptions of e-learning and XR immersion. The data were analyzed by using a combination of descriptive techniques from PSPP (GNU open source SPSS-Statistical Package for the Social Sciences, Free Software Foundation, Boston, MA, USA), and by designing a regression model to evaluate the work-life balance. This regression model shows that the work-life balance is positively influenced by the inclusion of XR facilities in the e-learning process, along with an increased level of culture and living standard. The higher living standard of a student is associated with higher digital competence and more financial resources available to invest in technology.

AB  - PurposeThis study aims to examine sustainability reporting through the lens of global reporting initiative (GRI) standards in developing economies, particularly in Pakistan, from the perspective of stakeholder theory, legitimacy theory, and system theory. Design/methodology/approachQualitative and quantitative analyses on economic, social and environmental areas of sustainability reporting based on the GRI standards are applied across 57 organizations listed on the Pakistan stock exchange over the years 2016-2020. FindingsThe results from the content analysis and descriptive statistics show that overall sustainability reporting increased persistently over time and limited organizations disclose economic, social and environmental sustainability based on GRI standards. Moreover, the result from the two-tailed correlation analysis shows positive relations between economic, social and environmental sustainability reporting. Research limitations/implicationsFollowing the GRI standards, the regulators, government and policymakers need to assess the sustainability reporting based on GRI standards to improve corporate operations' transparency, stakeholder trust and legitimacy. The organizations should move beyond the compliance of regulatory norms and adopt the globally accepted sustainability GRI standards to improve sustainability reporting. The same kind of sustainability reporting is also advised for other countries with similar backgrounds and sustainability challenges. Social implicationsThe integrated sustainability reporting framework based on GRI standards enables the organizations to work as a system of interconnected economic, social and environmental sustainability to resolve the issue of sustainability reporting, ensure the trust of multiple stakeholders and legitimize their business operations in society. Originality/valueTo the best of the authors' knowledge and thorough review of literature, this is the first study that examines the sustainability reporting based on GRI in the developing country of Pakistan to extend the findings of previous studies from conventional sustainability reporting to the globally accepted GRI based sustainability reporting. Using system theory, this study provides an additional contribution to the consideration concerning sustainability reporting based on GRI standards in the context of Pakistan.

AB  - Monitoring progress toward sustainability goals requires a quantitative assessment method including indicators. Indicator sets and goals have typically been developed by experts, which may be scientifically robust but are often difficult to convey to society and may not include all societal values. A participatory assessment approach is emerging as a more holistic method for measuring sustainability. In this approach, local stakeholders play an integral part in the assessment process, assisted by experts. Here we reviewed 13 case studies from around the world that use a participatory approach to achieve sustainable natural resource management. Although similar in approach, most of them diverge in terms of methodology and extent of community engagement. The final set of indicators in each case is reflective of methodology, extent of community engagement, and amount of time and resources involved in the process. While the participatory approach is growing in popularity and increases the potential long-term success of the process (through increasing stakeholder literacy and ownership), the diversity of participatory methodology can complicate policy recommendations.

AB  - Inter- and transdisciplinary (ITD) research is increasingly called for and supported to promote sustainable transformation through knowledge co-production, knowledge integration, and solution development. The paper explores what is needed to support researchers in reflecting on their new roles in ITD research. We introduce a reflection tool that makes the growing literature on researchers' roles in sustainability science applicable to ITD projects. Its design is based on the arguments that each researcher can have several roles within one research project and that focusing on a few key roles increases clarity compared to differentiating many specialized roles. The tool consists of (1) a researcher survey that operationalizes six prominent roles (traditional scientist, self-reflexive scientist, knowledge integrator, knowledge broker, process facilitator, and change agent), (2) a visualization of role profiles from the survey, and (3) a set of reflection questions on related opportunities, challenges, and coping strategies on individual and project level. We empirically applied the tool in two ITD research projects focused on sustainable food production and water and forest ecosystem management. Comparative application of the tool yielded diverse role profiles of researchers in both projects, with different patterns for senior and junior researchers as well as natural and social scientists. The reflection produced a collection of opportunities, challenges, and coping strategies that corroborates and extends insights from ITD literature. We discuss how the tool triggers multi-dimensional reflection on roles (individual and project level, role combinations, self-perception and external perception) and outline opportunities for further strengthening such reflection in ITD research.

AB  - While tackling sustainability challenges, engineering students confront various uncertainties, including the unpredictability of real-world scenarios, unfamiliar aspects of problems, and conflicting viewpoints among stakeholders. Despite previous research indicating the likelihood of encountering such uncertainties in sustainability projects, it is unclear if students are aware of uncertainty and what specific regulatory behaviors they develop to address them. This study seeks to deepen our understanding of the awareness and regulation of uncertainty by students while they work on real-life sustainability challenges. To achieve this, we observed nine MSc students enrolled in a transdisciplinary course on urban sustainability at a Dutch university of technology. Through interviews, we explored the uncertainties they faced and how they navigated them. Our analysis, conducted through open, consensus-based coding by two researchers, revealed that students primarily encountered the uncertainty of multiplicity, characterized by divergent stakeholder perspectives. Additionally, students increasingly recognized the inherent unpredictability of the challenges over the course. To address uncertainty, students developed three kinds of behaviors to deal with uncertainty: seeking social support from commissioners, coaches, and peers; employing small coping mechanisms to overcome obstacles; and developing attitudes such as empathy, flexibility, and relativism. This study offers detailed insights into how students navigate uncertainty. Moving forward, efforts in uncertainty education should prioritize how educators can positively influence the development of metacognition in uncertainty.

AB  - Managing stakeholders in construction projects is crucial since stakeholders are perceived as a significant source of uncertainty because of the various stakeholders involved, especially in mixed development projects. The preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) method was used to analyse and select the most relevant publications from two identified databases: SCOPUS and Web of Science (WoS). Only 55 of 1600 publications were identified as relevant to stakeholder impact factors in the construction projects. Towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 11, 10 stakeholder impact factors affecting the success of mixed development project management during the COVID-19 pandemic were identified and arranged by frequency: stakeholder engagement, stakeholder relationship, stakeholder attribute, stakeholder influence, stakeholder interest, stakeholder needs, stakeholder satisfaction, stakeholder expectation, and stakeholder behaviour. The outcome of this study would assist the construction project team in effectively managing and engaging with the relevant stakeholders to attain SDG 11 associated with sustainable cities and communities, specifically for the mixed development projects during the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Climate change forces higher educational institutions (HEI) to reconsider their traditional ways of teaching and organising education. This implies that they should reduce their impact on the environment and provide sustainability-oriented education. Blended learning (fusion of on-campus and online learning) may provide an appealing solution to achieve both objectives. It may reduce HEI's climate impact by reducing student travel to and from campus and support the development of students' sustainability competencies. In this paper, pedagogical design principles and recommendations are developed to design such a sustainability-oriented blended learning configuration. A realist review methodology is used to distil and develop pedagogical principles for blended learning. These principles were mirrored against pedagogical approaches that have been identified as suitable for developing sustainability competencies. This mirroring revealed some overlap but also some notable differences. Common principles include self-regulation, community building, discussion, knowledge management, and collaboration, but some principles identified in sustainability-oriented education are noticeably absent, including self-awareness, orientation towards sustainable change, and interdisciplinary collaboration. The insights guide designing sustainability-oriented blended learning and vice versa can also provide ideas for people working in off-line place-based contexts on sustainability-oriented education, to consider blended options.

AB  - Multifunctional and diversified agriculture can address diverging pressures and demands by simulta-neously enhancing productivity, biodiversity, and the provision of ecosystem services. The use of digital technologies can support this by designing and managing resource-efficient and context-specific agri-cultural systems. We present the Digital Agricultural Knowledge and Information System (DAKIS) to demonstrate an approach that employs digital technologies to enable decision-making towards diver-sified and sustainable agriculture. To develop the DAKIS, we specified, together with stakeholders, re-quirements for a knowledge-based decision-support tool and reviewed the literature to identify limitations in the current generation of tools. The results of the review point towards recurring chal-lenges regarding the consideration of ecosystem services and biodiversity, the capacity to foster communication and cooperation between farmers and other actors, and the ability to link multiple spatiotemporal scales and sustainability levels. To overcome these challenges, the DAKIS provides a digital platform to support farmers' decision-making on land use and management via an integrative spatiotemporally explicit approach that analyses a wide range of data from various sources. The approach integrates remote and in situ sensors, artificial intelligence, modelling, stakeholder-stated demand for biodiversity and ecosystem services, and participatory sustainability impact assessment to address the diverse drivers affecting agricultural land use and management design, including natural and agronomic factors, economic and policy considerations, and socio-cultural preferences and settings. Ultimately, the DAKIS embeds the consideration of ecosystem services, biodiversity, and sustainability into farmers' decision-making and enables learning and progress towards site-adapted small-scale multifunctional and diversified agriculture while simultaneously supporting farmers' objectives and societal demands.

AB  - Transdisciplinary sustainability science integrates multiple perspectives, promotes internal reflexivity and situated learning, and engages with multiple stakeholders to solve real-world sustainability challenges. Therefore, transdisciplinary approaches to teaching and learning for sustainability science have traditionally focused on promoting core skills such as systems thinking and science communication. However, as the socio-ecological crises grow in intensity and complexity, so too must our conceptualisation of the core tenants of transdisciplinary sustainability science. To this end, we propose a model for teaching and learning that considers the contemporary pressures of sustainability science praxis. We highlight how social science perspectives can be used to situate considerations of power, justice, and historical responsibility at the centre of sustainability discussions while helping students understand the drivers of transformative change at the individual and societal levels. We outline the benefits of using arts-based approaches in the classroom to facilitate participation and opportunities for creative expression and peer and co-learning. We also discuss the importance of and provide strategies for supporting students in dealing with anxiety and ecological grief. We provide suggestions for assessment strategies that can be used to develop a range of competencies in students, including systems thinking, empowerment and collaboration. In a novel way, we model transdisciplinarity by drawing on insights from the disciplines in which we have expertise, including education, psychology, health, sociology, communications, social work, and science. We also provide an actionable, adaptable model for teaching and learning sustainability science in a rapidly warming world.

KW  - Systems thinking
AB  - Despite the industry's expansion, the Indonesian seaweed industry continues to face numerous challenges in achieving sustainability. Facilitating stakeholder dialogue is critical but rather complex, given their different perspectives and often competing interests and priorities. Therefore, this paper showcases how the application of Group Model Building (GMB) can effectively engage stakeholders and facilitate them to collectively identify critical issues against sustainability within the Indonesian seaweed value chain system. Specifically, the GMB approach facilitates the construction of a causal loop diagram to describe the interlinkages and feedback interactions between sustainability issues, causes, and consequences through three steps: problem identification, formulating a dynamic hypothesis, and model validation. The GMB process reveals that the seaweed value chain is a complex system, with underlying issues such as seaweed availability and quality that may threaten the industry's sustainability. The combination of these two issues also influences price dynamics and the competitiveness of seaweed products in the global market, ultimately detrimenting the sustainability of the seaweed industry. The study demonstrates the advantages of the GMB process, including developing a conceptual model portraying a holistic view of the seaweed industry and fostering mutual understanding and consensus among stakeholders about critical issues, causes, and consequences across the seaweed value chain systems. Consequently, this can facilitate more effective policymaking and priority-setting. However, it should be noted that conducting GMB requires proper preparation, resources, and time, as well as good initial communication with stakeholders.

AB  - UNESCO World Heritage K'gari-Fraser Island, located off the east coast of Australia, is a unique environment with boundless opportunities for teaching and research. The island encompasses pristine wilderness with large tracts of naturally fragmented habitat, a wide diversity of ecosystems and a rich and ancient indigenous history. The University of the Sunshine Coast, Australia (USC) has an environmental education and research centre at Dilli Village on the island. Dilli Village is an iconic flagship for USC and, potentially, offers the opportunities for interdisciplinary learning across the university. Environment and sustainability related education activities on K'gari-Fraser Island encompass a range of courses and programs much of which is closely tied to ongoing research projects on the island. This chapter is a case study of immersive interdisciplinary learning experiences on K'gari-Fraser Island in environmental and sustainability education. The study explores how the field experience may become a transformative experience and how that experience relates to alternate futures. Indeed, immersive field-based activities on K'gari-Fraser Island have the potential to achieve enduring learning outcomes and student transformations that are not possible in the classroom. The challenge now for the University is to move towards a more interdisciplinary and inclusive approach to field based learning on the island.

AB  - Agriculture is often considered a major factor in environmental degradation. This case study delves into the use of sociotechnical experiments-and, more specifically, agroecosystem living labs (ALLs)-to facilitate the transition of conventional agricultural practices toward heightened sustainability. Our research indicates that achieving successful collaboration, such as an experiment, necessitates the alignment of expectations, the establishment of trust, the cultivation of patience, and the allocation of substantial resources. This investigation into agroecosystem living labs contributes to our comprehension of the actors' networks, their interactions with experimental sites, and the dynamics of open innovation.

AB  - The 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) defined by the United Nations represent a blueprint for the adoption of global practices and policies to foster sustainability in societies and increase efficiencies in resources uses. The Italian National Trust, FAI, has embraced these goals, developing a holistic and transdisciplinary methodology to promote a more sustainable approach to preserve its natural and built heritage. This methodology combines heritage protection with the SDGs in various macro-areas of interventions, including energy, water, biosphere, responsible consumption, and sustainable communities. The aim is to increase access to affordable and clean energy, reduce water, waste, and soil footprints, promote responsible consumption, and develop human capital. The paper proposes a set of strategies to achieve the SDGs in heritage, involving the collaboration of several stakeholders, ranging from institutions to citizens. The methodology is applied to a specific Italian case study, Casa Macchi in Morazzone, to highlight the challenges in achieving the dual objective of preserving the historic building and promoting sustainability in the built environment.

AB  - Prior studies on high-fit corporate social responsibility programs have yield equivocal findings; some studies have shown a positive impact on desirable customer outcomes and others have shown a negative impact. To reconcile these two divergent views, this study proposes that the relationship between perceived corporate social responsibility-brand fit and sustainable customer engagement behavior is serially mediated by self-cause and/or brand integration. Furthermore, such serial mediation mechanism is moderated by environmental concern and green trust. The results of an empirical study carried out in the airline industry confirm that the link between perceived corporate social responsibility-brand fit and sustainable customer engagement behavior is serially mediated by self-cause and/or brand integration and moderated by environmental concern and green trust. Sustainable customer engagement behavior, in turn, drives customers' extra-role, citizenship behavior that goes beyond their in-role, loyalty behavior. This study contributes to the micro-corporate social responsibility stream of cleaner production by demonstrating that the relationship between perceived corporate social responsibility-brand fit and sustainable customer engagement behavior is not straightforward and by providing a theoretical framework to better explain the psychological mechanisms and boundary conditions affecting this relationship.

AB  - Current environmental problems are the primary focus for environmental science students and researchers. Sustainable environmental solutions require interdisciplinary thought processes, which pose difficulty to both students and the public. Computational thinking is an emerging term emphasized by progressive science curricula. Computational thinking and environmental science are both interdisciplinary by nature. Learning about sustainable environmental solutions requires students to partake in computational thinking. These ideas lend toward an expansive learning progression that encourages scaffolded and differentiated student progress in both computational knowledge and environmental knowledge. The learning progression, which emerges from the conceptual framework, emphasizes the spheres of sustainability, research, education, and economic perspectives to support environmental science learning through computational thinking. Computational thinking emphasized by the computational components (input, integration, output, and feedback) support learning about environmental solutions within the learning progression. The learning progression promotes application and implications for educators, students, researchers, and environmental scientists.

AB  - Corporations, as major contributors to carbon emissions, face mounting pressure to adopt genuine sustainability practices. However, the rise of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) disclosures has concurrently given rise to greenwashing-misleading claims that erode stakeholder trust and obstruct sustainability progress. Despite the widespread acknowledgment of greenwashing, there is a notable gap in research identifying the key factors that can mitigate it. This study addresses this gap by developing a comprehensive framework using Total Interpretive Structural Modeling (TISM) and Matriced' Impacts Croise<acute accent>s Multiplication Applique<acute accent>e a` un Classement (MICMAC) analysis. Drawing on an extensive literature review and expert opinions, the study identifies critical factors, including artificial intelligence, digital transformation, green finance, and robust monitoring mechanisms, as instrumental in combating ESG greenwashing, while environmental awareness is found to have minimal influence. TISM uncovers causal relationships among these factors, and MICMAC categorizes them based on their driving and dependence power. The findings provide actionable insights for policymakers, corporations, and investors, offering a structured pathway to enhance transparency, strengthen corporate accountability, and align business practices with global sustainability objectives.

AB  - This paper evaluates a unique, transdisciplinary participatory research and knowledge exchange methodology developed in the Drought Risk and You (DRY) project and offers it as a transferable framework for others engaging stakeholders and systemic connections with environmental risk. Drought in the UK is a complex, diffuse and hidden risk, involving multiple stakeholders and systemic connections across diverse sectors. Historically, drought risk management has been underpinned by specialist science and technology implemented by statutory stakeholders. This paper critically evaluates the social learning from a longitudinal research process that involved co-working with seven river catchment-based, multi-stakeholder groups. The DRY project was a creative experiment in bringing drought science and stories into the same space, aiming to reveal different knowledges-specialist science, practical sector-level insight, and local knowledge-as a new evidence base to support better decision-making in UK drought risk management. An evaluative multi-method research methodology was overlaid on this process, using surveys, within meeting reflective evaluations, and summative semi-structured narrative interviews. This paper reflects on participant experiences of the 'open' scientific modelling development, 'storying' approaches, and their iterative interaction. It outlines the enablers, inhibitors and required support for this engagement process, which aimed to facilitate integration of different forms of knowledge as evidence, with social and sustainability learning among diverse stakeholders at its core. The process offered opportunity for valuable experiential learning as researchers of the nuanced impacts of intersecting factors on participatory place-based methods. It showed that similar approaches to science-narrative dialogic processes can play out locally to integrate aspects of social and sustainability learning in different ways. This sustainability learning provided a valuable platform for creative multi-stakeholder scenario-ing possible drought futures for increased local climate resilience. It then proposes a transferable research framework that promotes participatory, place-based, narrative-science knowledge exchange for building local capital for managing systemic environmental risk.

AB  - Although the South African film industry has the required competency to become a significant player in the international film market, few South African films enjoy commercial success. This paper examines why South African films are not more successful and assesses what government and other stakeholders can do to promote a sustainable and successful film industry. The paper draws on the experiences of the United States, the United Kingdom and other countries to argue that the South African government should not focus solely on the cultural aspects of the film product but should attach more importance to distribution, promotion and audience development.

AB  - The importance of community attitude and participation for the success and sustainability of cultural festivals has been steadily increasing in recent years. The Chuncheon Puppet Festival (CPF) is an international festival that has been held every year since 1989 in Chuncheon, Korea. The festival has several distinctive characteristics as a sustainable event because: (a) it maintains its single genre of puppet performances based on modern cultural art; (b) it is well-established as the festival for the local residents of Chuncheon City and is planned by local community residents and local small companies, not by government agencies or global large entrepreneurs; (c) it helps children to have an interesting cultural experience in the local environment; and (d) it is regularly hosted in August, an off-season for festivals in Korea that was chosen by residents as it is a school holiday season. However, there is still room for improvement to secure its place as a successful sustainable festival. The following might be considered: (i) increased exchange of human resources among the festival executive members, community groups, and the public staff in Chuncheon City; (ii) local residents should maintain full control of the festival; and (iii) a local cultural trust should be established by cultural art professionals, local resident organizations, puppet show professionals, and public agency staff. The CPF is a typical example of a successful sustainable festival with proactive and supportive community participation and a large number of volunteers that help to increase local competitiveness and sustainable local development. This case report delivers insightful lessons and messages to guide what needs to be preconditioned for local cultural festivals to be sustainable and successful for a long time in many destinations, where they can contribute as efficient catalysts for regional tourism development.

AB  - Firms are critical stakeholders to achieve sustainable development. Thus, corporate environmental performance is a subject of broad concern. In an era of globalization, the relationship between trade and environment is hotly debated. One of the central questions is-will imported intermediates contribute to pollution abatement? Using Chinese firm-level data from 2000 to 2013, the article measures the technology spillover of imported intermediates and empirically tests the inhibitory effect and influence mechanism on pollution intensity with a fixed effects model and an instrumental variable approach. We find that: 1) the technology spillover directly increases innovation and indirectly affects innovation by importing diversity. Imported intermediates empower firms with insufficient innovation to control pollution. However, the incentive effect declines when innovation gradually improves. 2) The technology spillover diffuses along the industrial chain. Downstream firms benefit from the diffusion and thus have lower pollution intensity than upstream firms. 3) The technology spillover contributes to the end-of-pipe emission reduction. Also, it improves energy efficiency and promotes source governance. Furthermore, the environmental benefits of imported intermediates differ along a number of dimensions including sourcing countries, firm ownership, and location. Thus, we pinpoint a new channel concerning trade-induced technique effect. Meanwhile, our results confirm the rationale of liberalization and facilitation policies for imported intermediates, that is, trade policies have the potential to better contribute to sustainable development goals.

AB  - "What do you think the Mine of 2030 will be like?"
   Animated by this question, The University of Queensland's Sustainable Minerals Institute 2018 Master Class on "Mining and Society in the 21st Century" developed a vision of an ideal future for the mining industry in 2030. Discussions explored the means to accelerate the industry's current trajectory towards greater sustainability. The class included doctoral students and academic researchers from diverse cultural backgrounds whose mining-focused work spans a broad range of disciplines. This paper distils the outcomes of the discussions and propose actions into a framework that centres on the interface between mining companies, governments and host communities. We argue that there are several concrete actions that the mining industry should adopt immediately to promote trust between stakeholders and strengthen the industry's contribution to achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.

AB  - Urban areas of the present and future can be sustainably transformed by involving community participation in decision-making because of their local knowledge. Most of the Indian cities have water management problems like accessibility, availability, quality, adequate infra-structure and user charges. Urban water management is one of the prime responsibilities of urban local bodies in India, but there is no provision to assess public satis-faction. This study focuses on the assessment of the satis-faction level of the public on urban water management in Central India to improve the efficiency of urban water. The methodology and proposed framework will help in distinguishing the poor functioning among water attri-butes that need to be strengthened to maximize the ef-ficiency of the water management system.

AB  - Wide agreement exists that the "Anthropocene" demands new forms of engagement and responses to achieve sustainability, but different fields suggest quite different approaches. In this communication, we set out four perspectives that we argue have fundamentally different framings of the "problem" of the Anthropocene, and consequently point to very different responses to achieving sustainability. These four fields include: the eco-modernist perspective, the planetary stewardship paradigm, the pathways to sustainability approach, and the critical post-humanist paradigm. We suggest that a deeper underlying framing which can help integrate aspects of these four perspectives is an understanding of the "Anthropocene as responsibility". We argue that from this perspective it becomes possible to engage with an ethics of responsibility that comes with being human and acting on the planet, in the face of an uncertain and unknowable future.

AB  - Purpose - This paper aims to present an experience-based learning framework that provides a bottom-up, student-centered entrance point for the development of systems thinking, normative and collaborative competencies in sustainability.
   Design/methodology/approach - The framework combines mental mapping with exploratory walking. It interweaves mapping and walking activities with methodological and theoretical inputs as well as with reflections and discussions. The framework aligns experiential activities, i.e. mental mapping and walking, with learning objectives, i.e. novice-level sustainability competencies. The authors applied the framework for student activities in Phoenix/Tempe and Hamburg/Lenuburg as part of The Global Classroom, a project between Arizona State University in the USA and Leuphana University of Luneburg in Germany.
   Findings - The application of the experience-based learning framework demonstrates how students started developing systems thinking (e.g. understanding urban systems as functional entities and across different domains), normative (e.g. using different sustainability principles) and collaborative (e.g. learning across disciplinary, social and cultural differences) competencies in sustainability.
   Originality/value - The experience-based learning framework contributes to the development of curricular activities for the initial development of sustainability competencies in introductory-level courses. It enables students from different disciplinary, social and cultural backgrounds, e.g. in international education, to collaboratively start developing such competencies. The framework can be adapted to different educational contexts.

AB  - While the concept of environmental sustainability has steadily grown over the past thirty years, little progress has been made in unifying the efforts of the entities most involved: society, the environment, the economy, and governmental policy. This synthesis integrates across disciplines to outline the need for a harmonized sustainability model to align disparate environmental objectives. Specifically, this study highlights the disconnect between policy and capitalistic economies regarding environmental sustainability. We then provide a framework for an updated sustainability model and offer pathways toward an improved state of environmental sustainability. Notable contributions include the development of a dynamic, harmonized sustainability model derived from basic supply and demand curves that functions for both the consumption and disposal of resources at multiple scales.

AB  - Both within science and society, transdisciplinary approaches are increasingly employed to address today's sustainability challenges. Often transdisciplinary research processes are structured in three core phases: a) problem identification and formation of a common research object; b) co-production of solution-oriented and transferable knowledge; c) embedding co-produced knowledge through transdisciplinary reintegration. In all phases of this ideal-typical model, the involvement of non-academic actors is essential to meet the challenges of real-world problems, and of transformative research practices. Despite existing guidance for the core trans disciplinary process, its initiation often remains an uncharted area because of its strong context dependency. Based on a concrete transdisciplinary case study addressing sustainability transformation in Transylvania, we bring together our learned experience with initiating a transdisciplinary process using a research-driven approach. To this end, we introduce the notion of Phase 0, as an initiating phase prior to beginning an ideal typical transdisciplinary process. Within Phase 0, we propose three empirically and literature informed sub phases: Sub-Phase 0.1) selecting the case study; Sub-Phase 0.2) understanding the case study context from a transdisciplinary perspective; Sub-Phase 0.3) fostering premises for coming together. We outline the general rationale behind these sub-phases, and we illustrate how we carried out each sub-phase in practice. By deriving cross-cutting lessons from the three sub-phases, we enhance the practice of transdisciplinary sustainability research with the aim to leverage its transformative potential.

AB  - In recent years, green building technologies (GBTs) have gradually been implemented to minimize negative impacts of the construction industry on the environment, economy, and society. In order to encourage widespread adoption of GBTs, a better and deeper understanding of the drivers for implementing GBTs is necessary. This study aims to identify the major drivers of GBTs implementation. The methodological framework used consists of a comprehensive literature review and a questionnaire survey of international green building (GB) experts, rather than experts in a particular country. The results of statistical analyses of 104 expert responses indicate that the top five drivers for implementing GBTs are energy-efficiency, reduced environmental impact, water-efficiency, occupants' health and comfort and satisfaction, and company image/reputation. Results from t-test analysis confirm that out of the 21 drivers examined, 13 are perceived to be significant. The Kendall's concordance test shows that though the experts were from different countries and with diverse backgrounds, a good consensus was reached in their rankings of the drivers. The Mann-Whitney U test also verifies the absence of significant differences among the experts in ranking most of the drivers. The findings of this study not only contribute to deepened understanding of the major factors that greatly drive GBTs implementation, but could also encourage the industry practitioners and stakeholders aiming at achieving better construction sustainability to further implement GBTs in the future. From the perspective of international GB experts, this study makes a contribution to the body of knowledge about GBTs implementation drivers, which is important for GBTs promotion.

AB  - According to contemporary literature, stakeholder management (which is one of the identified clues of sustainable project management) plays a significant role in successfully delivering construction projects. However, the literature focuses on the issues of stakeholder management/analysis mainly for large projects, and the authors could not find any items related to small construction projects. The aim of the article is to present the results of research conducted in small construction companies in the context of stakeholder management of their projects against the background of project success and sustainability. Many researchers have concluded that stakeholder management is one of the success factors of projects (including construction projects). Based on the conducted quantitative research, the needs in the field of stakeholder management of small construction companies' projects were determined and the approaches used in this area were diagnosed. The research results indicate a low level of maturity of small construction companies in managing project stakeholders, which is a surprising result considering the fact that the literature on the subject emphasizes the importance of taking care of the project stakeholder management area and associating it with the project's success.

AB  - Resource-poor farmers in the Philippines have limited options for sustaining their livelihood, therefore it is important for them to practise and/or develop sustainable farming systems. But often in sustainability evaluations the perceptions of local stakeholders are not considered, although they are the ones who will apply sustainable technologies - or not apply them! This paper reports a study in Leyte, Philippines, where farmers, as well as stakeholders active in extension advice, on five study sites were asked to identify and rank criteria that could be used for comparison of different farming systems. Criteria were organised under the Sustainable Rural Livelihoods Framework, with its five capital assets: financial, physical, natural, human and social. When stakeholders ranked the identified list of criteria later individually, statistical differences between farmers and other stakeholders as well as between regions were found with regard to single criteria, but not with regard to the importance of the five different capital assets. Furthermore, farmers' individual ranking differed from the ranking by the group during focus group discussions. These findings indicate that the perceptions of farmers and other stakeholders regarding sustainability of farming systems are similar when looking at the whole picture, but differences regarding single issues can be wider. This underlines the importance of including several local stakeholders to identify suitable criteria. The concept of sustainable rural livelihoods seemed to correspond with stakeholders', especially farmers', perception of sustainability and worked well for identifying criteria covering all aspects of sustainability, including social and human aspects.

AB  - Human health and well-being are directly and indirectly dependent on the life of river systems. Life in river systems is increasingly dependent on human actions that bring river health into being. Rather than describing river health as thing, problem or management challenge, this paper explores how river health is brought into being, through the citizen science practices of the Amanzi Ethu Nobuntu project in the upper uMngeni catchment in South Africa. The study draws on focal data produced by citizen science practitioners, as interpreted by them in collaboration with partners in the catchment, and their reflections on the meaning(s) of river health and how it came into being. Drawing on the concepts of citizen science as a co-learning process, integrative views of One Health, and commoning as activity, the study offers a rich interpretation on how river health comes into being. The study shows the complex interrelated practices involved, including practices of resolving leaks and pollution challenges, social and community engagement, and the co-learning involved in citizen science practices itself. It offers insight into the social- ecological and ethical-political ontological dynamics of river health commoning activity, thus offering alternatives to reductionist approaches to bringing river health into being, potentially also enriching tools for river health reporting. Significance: The significance of the main findings of Sustainability Science Engagement and Engaged Sustainability Sciences includes how citizen science can be key for engaging local communities in sustainability research around sustainability challenges, such as river health, by linking to the health of the people and their everyday engagements with the river. Further contributions include conceptualising sustainability science engagement co-learning processes of being in common around a shared matter of concern, such as bringing river health into being beyond technical specifications. Contributions are also made by highlighting how sustainability science engagement can result in richness in terms of knowing sustainability challenges.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has shifted the education sector towards an e-learning approach to sustain education. Sustaining student education through e-learning significantly impacts student learning experiences and outcomes, which can be influenced by e-learning infrastructure, e-learning materials, and learning engagement. The concept of humanising education refers to the learning process that reflects students' moralities and values. Focus group discussion is a practical approach to assess students' perspectives on sustaining and humanising their education through e-learning. This qualitative focus group study aimed to discuss the e-learning factors that will sustain education and promote humanising education in the virtual learning environment. Thirty students from Information Technology (IT) and business fields have participated and provided a different view on sustaining education through e-learning. Thematic analysis was used to analyse the focus group data. Five themes were identified: (1) e-learning technologies and infrastructure; (2) e-learning principles: pedagogy and materials; (3) health and wellness; (4) equality; and (5) engagement: communication and collaboration. The analysis enlightened the e-learning design for sustainable e-learning. In addition, this paper outlines how the findings support sustainable development goals.

AB  - Project delivery of sustainable buildings is more complex than that for traditional buildings. It requires early interdisciplinary collaboration with full commitment of team members to the project's green goals-ensured by delivery methods, contractual conditions, team procurement, and project management practices. As the need for sustainable built environment grows, the demand for professionals who can manage delivery of sustainable buildings efficiently will also increase in the (architecture, engineering, and construction) industry. Teaching delivery of sustainable building characteristics to students through traditional methods is challenging, however. This paper presents a case study in which a multidisciplinary graduate class of 14 students was exposed to case-based collaborative-learning methods, examining whether these methods could improve student understanding of sustainable building delivery. The results of pre- and post case study assignment surveys and evaluation of role play and open class discussions show that understanding of key delivery parameters is improved, especially for design integration and team characteristics. The methods also improved student interest, shown by semester evaluations. The classroom presence of students from different backgrounds (e. g., engineering, construction management, and design) benefitted student-learning in a collaborative environment. The results provide insights for schools, departments, and instructors seeking effective ways to teach sustainable built environment processes. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)EI.1943-5541.0000090.

AB  - The success of geotourism development is strongly influenced by the orientation (perceptions, motivations and preferences) of the stakeholders. An aim of the study was to analyze the polarization of stakeholder orientation towards geotourism development in the Mount Slamet and Serayu Mountainous areas, Central Java Province. Research instrument used a closed-ended questionnaire following the scoring pattern of "One Score One Indicator Scoring System". The sample of respondents was 8 stakeholder groups with a total of 1,252 respondents. The characteristics of the stakeholder was analysed by quantitative descriptive, while the indication of the polarization of the stakeholder orientation was analyzed by using the one way Anova statistical test. Results indicated that the polarization of stakeholder orientation had a positive direction and scale of polarization was strong. This conditions showed that there is a gap in the value of stakeholder orientation which makes the performance of geotourism development less than optimal. It is necessary to improve the quality of collaboration and cooperation so that there is no polarization in the orientation between stakeholders to achieve the sustainable geotourism development.

AB  - Effective governance of the global ocean under accelerating environmental and social changes depends on sufficient scientific knowledge that unravels the complexity of dynamic marine ecosystems. In the case of the vast and remote ocean twilight zone (OTZ), management is particularly challenged by the lack of data. Traditional biodiversity monitoring methods are unable to scale efficiently or effectively to address these knowledge gaps and new technologies are needed to inform policy. Environmental DNA (eDNA) has quickly gained traction in recent years as an enabling technology for marine conservation that will play a transformative role in OTZ biodiversity conservation and high seas governance in general. Through a comprehensive review of science and policy literature and an analysis of existing global marine biodiversity data, we discuss the importance of biodiversity conservation in the OTZ, review existing knowledge gaps, and summarize recent developments in eDNA and OTZ biodiversity research. We identify the key components of an eDNA framework that are needed for OTZ biodiversity monitoring and discuss policy implications relevant to the recent Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction (BBNJ) Agreement. We show that an integrated science-policy approach based on transdisciplinary eDNA research is essential for achieving sustainability in the OTZ and the 30x30 target for conserving ocean biodiversity.

AB  - Access to reliable, affordable, sustainable, and modern energy, along with the empowerment and increased participation of women in decision-making and politics, are fundamental to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set forth by the United Nations (UN). The UN accentuates the critical role of women in politics for the successful attainment of the SDGs. This study delves into this aspect by investigating the impact of female political representation on access to electricity. Additionally, the study examines the influence of government efficiency, foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows, urbanization, and economic growth in Nigeria, utilizing data spanning from 2003Q1 to 2021Q4. Employing advanced econometric techniques such as wavelet quantile regression, wavelet quantile correlation, and quantile-on-quantile Granger causality analysis, our analysis reveals noteworthy insights. Our findings reveal a correlation between heightened female political representation and decreased access to electricity in Nigeria. Additionally, we note the beneficial impacts of foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows, economic growth, and governmental efficiency on the accessibility of electricity. Furthermore, our quantile-on-quantile Granger causality analysis highlights the predictive capabilities of female political representation, urbanization, FDI, and economic growth regarding electricity accessibility in Nigeria. Drawing from the insights gleaned in our study, we have crafted substantial policy recommendations designed to tackle the identified challenges and promote advancements in both electricity access and women's political engagement.

AB  - Finding leverage points for sustainability transformation of industrial and infrastructure systems is challenging, given that transformation is emergent from the complex interactions among socio-technical system elements over time within a specific social, technical and geographical context. Participatory multi-modelling, in which modellers and stakeholders collaborate to develop multiple interacting models to support a shared understanding of systems, is a promising approach to support sustainability transformations. The participatory process of modeling can serve as a leverage point by facilitating social learning amongst stakeholders, in which models can function as boundary objects that facilitate dialogue between stakeholders from different social worlds. We propose that participatory multi-modeling allows for the creation of a boundary object ecology, which involves a set of interacting and co-evolving boundary objects emerging throughout the modeling process. To explore this, we analyse the participatory multi-modelling process in the Windmaster project in the Rotterdam Port industrial cluster to understand which design choices were key to the creation of boundary objects. Our analysis shows that two types of design choices were key: design choices that enabled translations between participants, and those between participants and their organisation. We conclude that conceptualising participatory multi-modelling as a process of an evolving boundary object ecology, creating and adapting multiple interacting boundary objects provides a novel perspective that is useful for analysis and design of future participatory multi-modeling processes.

AB  - The study examined published works on the contribution of agricultural extension to the empowerment of women for agricultural development. It also explored the theoretical and practical implications. A systematic search in Scopus using relevant sets of keywords, including "agriculture extension", "capacity building", "women's empowerment", "women's agency", "women farmers", "gender" and "agriculture", identified 77 pertinent articles published between 1987-2023. The findings revealed that research on women's empowerment in agriculture through capacity building had grown steadily since 1987, with leading journals being Gender, Technology and Development and the Journal of Agricultural Education and Extension. Quisumbing, Mudege, and Ponnusamy emerge as prolific authors, while India boasts the most distributed studies. Beyond a comprehensive review, this work introduces a novel concept for understanding women's empowerment in agriculture. The concept comprised of five extension methods designed to empower women farmers, emphasising informed decision -making and leveraging the various forms of capital. The new conceptual framework aims to drive a collaborative approach towards achieving Sustainable Development Goal 5 - Gender Equality. Additionally, the review offers a comprehensive systematic review of gender studies, particularly in agriculture. It highlights the need for intercultural studies to examine the effectiveness of the proposed framework across diverse cultural contexts and regions.

AB  - The conceptual exploration of sustainable business models (SBMs) is new in the literature, and there is still a limited understanding of how these models might look in practice. As theory development should be grounded in reality, more empirical research is needed. This paper aims to contribute to the literature by exploring how a specific type of SBM (product-service systems) may contribute to sustainability. The business models of two companies located in an emerging economy (Brazil) were analysed through business model lenses. The goal was to examine the key characteristics, how the solutions have overcome the barriers associated with business model implementation, enablers, cooperative arrangements, and the link between technology advancement and innovation. Multiple sources were used to gather data, and an inductive approach based on grounded theory was applied for data analysis. The main findings show the role of collaborative approaches and stakeholder interaction in fostering SBM implementation and overcoming the main barriers associated with the implementation. Innovative technologies are also an important driver for achieving environmental improvements. Future research may focus on exploring other SBMs implemented in developing countries, the main sustainability benefits, and the collaborative approaches established.

AB  - Introduction Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors have become essential considerations for businesses seeking long-term sustainability and stakeholder trust. Effective ESG communication and disclosure practices are critical in demonstrating corporate commitment to sustainability. This study examines how the top 20 companies listed on the Thailand Stock Exchange communicate and disclose ESG-related information, with a focus on their integration of ESG metrics into business strategies.Methods This research employs a qualitative approach, utilizing secondary data from sustainability and ESG reports published by the selected companies. Thematic analysis is applied to identify and categorize key ESG activities and disclosure practices, providing a structured assessment of how businesses articulate their ESG commitments.Results The analysis identifies five key themes in ESG communication and disclosure: (1) comprehensive ESG disclosure and reporting, (2) environmental initiatives, (3) employee welfare, (4) governance and risk management, and (5) community development. These themes highlight the diverse approaches taken by companies to integrate ESG factors into their business models and public reporting.Discussion The findings underscore the importance of transparent ESG disclosure in enhancing corporate sustainability and stakeholder engagement. Companies that effectively integrate ESG considerations can mitigate risks, identify new business opportunities, and align with global sustainability standards. While the relationship between ESG practices and financial performance remains complex, existing literature suggests that strong ESG commitments can lead to long-term financial benefits. This study provides practical recommendations for Thai businesses to enhance their ESG communication strategies and strengthen their sustainability efforts.

AB  - Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) worldwide are under increasing pressure to balance biodiversity conservation with the growing demands of tourism, often exacerbated by anthropogenic impacts on coastal ecosystems. Exogenous shocks, such as environmental or policy-driven events, can offer opportunities for shifts in natural resource governance. This longitudinal study examines how a 2016 tourism ban in Mexico Islas Marietas National Park, prompted by coral reef degradation, influenced its polycentric governance. We use a mixed-methods approach, analyzing data from 53 governance meetings held before (March 2015 to April 2016) and after (May 2016 to November 2017) the regulatory shock. We compare stakeholder participation, affiliation networks, rules, and institutions to assess changes in the polycentric governance system. Our results show an increase in stakeholder engagement and two new decision-making forums have emerged. Network analysis reveals a rise in network density and social ties, suggesting enhanced trust and collaboration among stakeholders, although individual stakeholder responses to the shock varied. The tourism ban triggered a shift towards formalizing collaboration agreements, increasing stakeholder involvement in shaping public use norms, and decentralizing revenue generation. The coastal MPA also implemented a specific regulatory framework with recalculated carrying capacity, improved monitoring, and stricter accountability for tour operators. The Islas Marietas case offers valuable insights into coastal management in the Anthropocene, emphasizing the need for adaptive polycentric governance approaches that foster collaboration, and empower stakeholders to safeguard the long-term sustainability of both marine commons and livelihoods.

AB  - The enculturation of sustainable development concept through education system, especially via STEM subjects, is vital in developing citizens who are able to adopt sustainability as a life principle. Although STEM agenda has been emphasized in the national education blueprint, attention is needed on the role of STEM education especially chemistry subject toward education for sustainable development. In this chapter, a framework that encompassing six main areas, namely education policy, awareness, resources, curriculum orientation, pedagogical approach and stakeholder's engagement is proposed in guiding the enculturation of sustainable development concept through chemistry curriculum. The government and institutional policies play an important role to create awareness in understanding the concept and relevance of the sustainable development concept in chemistry subject. Training, finance and time have been identified as resources that need to be considered while integrating sustainable development concept in syllabus and contextualizing chemistry content that should be considered in the curriculum. In addition, the learning outcomes need to be revised based on the pedagogical types, learning approaches and pedagogical techniques used. Lastly, the framework will be instrumental for administrators and teachers to develop a sustainable chemistry teaching toward achieving education for sustainable development with the participation of stakeholders, including government, experts in the field of ESD, administrators and chemistry teachers, in enculturing sustainable development concepts through chemistry subject.

AB  - It is widely accepted that community engagement is vital for achieving sustainable development outcomes. While governments in several low-income countries have introduced community engagement for their electrification initiatives, the adequacy of traditional top-down approaches to capture community needs has been contested. In this paper, we holistically assess the barriers to needs-centric community engagement. Based on a community survey with 1.016 participants and 54 semi-structured interviews with government institutions and energy businesses in Uganda and Zambia, we unpack the relationships between communities and the public sector, and between communities and energy companies to interrogate the realities of community engagement in rural electrification. We find considerable gaps between community preferences for needs-centric engagement and how public and private sectors are currently engaging. Key institutional barriers for needs-centric community engagement are vertical and horizontal disconnections within the public sector as well as challenging and ineffective sharing of crucial information. For energy companies the main obstacle is the limited value attributed to a deep understanding of community needs. Based on our results, we develop an integrated model for community engagement focused on capturing energy needs. The model combines top-down and bottom-up engagement approaches where public institutions play a catalytic role in setting a flexible enabling environment for energy companies to establish deep connections with local communities, and where communities are given a platform to define and communicate immediate and long-term needs through context-specific means.

AB  - Evaluation is a major issue in discussions of transdisciplinary research (TDR). Empirical studies often consider expert perspectives; however, knowledge of the experiences, attitudes, and motivations of a broader science-practice community applying transdisciplinarity remains rare. The present study aims to gather insights into the perceptions and assessments of success of TDR projects from scientists and practitioners with experience with TDR processes. Based on a mixed-method approach combining qualitative expert interviews with a quantitative survey reaching 178 respondents from practice and science, the results show a high commitment to the targets of TDR projects and a basic shared ` success profile'. Nevertheless, there is currently a strong ` practice tendency', while TDR-specific benefits of the scientific knowledge gain remain neglected. The general success assessment of TDR projects can be described as rather moderate, indicating several deficits in the application and management of TDR.

AB  - The prevention of occupational diseases is part of government strategies aimed at sustainable development. It has a high significance for employers, workers and occupational health managers. This study deals with aspects related to the subject from a theoretical-methodological position that considers the current conditions of socioeconomic development in Cuba, with the objective of determining essential elements of an interdisciplinary, humanistic, active and transforming approach in the prevention of occupational diseases for sustainable development. From a dialectic al-materialistposition, theoretical methods such as the historical-logical and systematization were applied during the research; among the empirical methods, document review and expert consultation were used. As part of the result, the current conditions of socioeconomic development in Cuba are specified, indicative of the need to define some theoretical-methodological criteria for the prevention of occupational diseases; aspects of prevention as a process are defined and the essential elements of the approach are determined from an interdisciplinary position. In conclusive terms, it is reported that the socioeconomic conditions, the theoretical sources, the integral parts or basic nuclei and the interdisciplinary relations that constitute essential elements of the humanistic, active and transforming approach in the prevention of occupational diseases were determined.

AB  - People who live in areas with high diversity often do not have access to training opportunities because of the gaps in critical training areas, although a wealth of opportunities are available to conservation practitioners. There is a need to offer cost-effective, strategic, evidence-based, sustainable, equitable, and adaptive capacity-building training to African conservation practitioners. Concerted training platforms could fill these gaps by providing learning opportunities while leveraging limited time and money. Forty-two African trainees participated in 13 training sessions in Windhoek, Namibia, in 2018. Surveys were administered before and after training. Sixty-six percent of participants strongly agreed that the training was applicable to their work before and after training. Our results provide insight on the importance of conservation training opportunities for mid-career wildlife managers, conservationists, and practitioners, including the need to ensure training opportunities are accessible and relevant to various people and their needs.

AB  - Increasingly, 'co-design' is a key concept and approach in global change and sustainability research, in the scholarship on science-policy interactions, and an expressed expectation in research programs and initiatives. This paper situates co-design and then synthesizes insights from real-life experiences of co-developing research projects in this Special Issue. It highlights common co-design elements (parameters and considerations of co-design and purpose-driven engagement activities); discusses challenges experienced in co-design and then emphasizes a range of rarely articulated benefits of co-design for both researchers, societal partners and the work they aim to do together. The paper summarizes some of the knowledge gains on social transformation to sustainability from the co-design phase and concludes that co-design as a process is an agent of transformation itself.

AB  - Objective To evaluate outcomes following a state-wide implementation of post arthroplasty review (PAR) clinics for patients following total hip and knee arthroplasty, led by advanced musculoskeletal physiotherapists in collaboration with orthopaedic specialists.
   Design and setting A prospective observational study analysed data collected by 10 implementation sites (five metropolitan and five regional/rural centres) between September 2014 and June 2015. Main outcome measures The Victorian Innovation and Reform Impact Assessment Framework was used to assess efficiency, effectiveness (access to care, safety and quality, workforce capacity, utilisation of skill sets, patient and workforce satisfaction) and sustainability (stakeholder engagement, succession planning and availability of ongoing funding).
   Results 2362 planned occasions of service (OOS) were provided for 2057 patients. Reduced patient wait times from referral to appointment were recorded and no adverse events occurred. Average cost savings across 10 sites was AUD$38 per OOS (Baseline $63, PAR clinic $35), representing a reduced pathway cost of 44%. Average annual predicted total value of increased orthopaedic specialist capacity was $11,950 per PAR clinic (range $6149 to $23,400). The Australian Orthopaedic Association review guidelines were met (8/10 sites, 80%) and patient-reported outcome measures were introduced as routine clinical care. High workforce and patient satisfaction were expressed. Eighteen physiotherapists were trained creating a sustainable workforce. Eight sites secured ongoing funding.
   Conclusions The PAR clinics delivered a safe, cost-efficient model of care that improved patient access and quality of care compared to traditional specialist-led workforce models.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic led to the closure of universities and colleges throughout the world, with the hope that public health officials' suggestion of social distancing would help flatten the sickness curve and reduce overall mortality from the outbreak. However, the Learning Management System (LMS) is the perfect approach for fostering the dedication of students to content in education like sustainability. Previous studies have seldom investigated an integrated approach in the context of LMS in industrialized nations. In addition, this paper aims to include a literature analysis of recent research conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic in the area of LMS usage, as well as to investigate variables predicting the usage of LMS by higher education students during the COVID-19 pandemic for students' engagement. On the basis of LMS usage data obtained from an online survey, structural equation modeling (SEM) and route analysis were utilized to verify the research model, a survey consisting of student LMS users King Saud University. The findings showed that the desire of students to use LMS had beneficial effects during the COVID-19 pandemic on learning as sustainability engagement. Also, student-perceived closeness, peer references and subjective well-being are favorably associated with the perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness, this, in turn, influences students' intentions to utilize, which, in turn, effects the usage of LMS for student engagement during COVID-19.

AB  - This manuscript explores the possibilities and challenges of art-science integration in facilitating collaborative sustainability action in local settings. To date, much sustainability education is prescriptive, rather than participatory, and most integrated art-science programming aims for content learning, rather than societal change. What this means is that learners are more often taught "what is" than invited to imagine "what if?" In order to envision and enact sustainable alternatives, there is a need for methods that allow community members, especially young people, to critically engage with the present, imagine a better future, and collaboratively act for sustainability today. This manuscript introduces a methodological framework that integrates the arts and sciences to facilitate: (1) transdisciplinary learning, focusing on local sustainability challenges; (2) participatory process, bringing experience-based knowledge into conversation with research-based knowledge; and (3) collaborative sustainability action, inviting community members to envision and enact sustainable alternatives where they live. The transformative potential of this framework is examined through international case studies from countries representing the richest and poorest in the Western hemisphere: a multi-site research study and after-school program for climate change education and action in collaboration with children in the Western US; and a multi-cycle research study and community arts center course for environmental photography and youth-led water advocacy in Southern Haiti. Despite many shared characteristics, case studies diverge in important ways relative to the sustainability challenges they sought to address, the specific context in which activities took place, and the manner in which art-science integration was practiced. Across cases, however, art-science integration facilitated participants' learning, connection, and action for sustainability. Framed by the shared aims of transdisciplinary approaches, this manuscript discusses methodological hurdles and practical lessons learned in art-science integration across settings as well as the transformative capacity of alternative pedagogical and research practices in building a sustainable future.

AB  - Many countries and regions consider industrialized construction to be a cleaner production method that facilitates sustainability in the construction industry. In China, proponents of industrialized construction have paid more attention to environmental and social sustainability, but the obstacles to economic sustainability have not been well solved. This study proposes a new industrialized construction method, OSI (On-site Industrialization). OSI combines the advantages of prefabrication and cast-in-situ. To develop and validate the OSI framework, this study conducts a two-phase action research. Based on the holistic overview of industrialized construction, the OSI framework was developed in action research phase 1. This framework includes five basic industrialized principles-standardization, prefabrication, modularization, lean, and sustainability. A multiple-case study was conducted in action research phase 2 to evaluate the sustainability performance of OSI from the perspective of triple-bottom-line (TBL), and the conventional precast concrete construction was used for benchmarking to validate the OSI framework. The findings indicate that OSI is a feasible industrialized construction method to balance the three dimensions of TBL in the Chinese construction industry. This research extends the theoretical knowledge body of industrialized construction while solving some practical problems in the construction industry. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Although rural partnership working is a well-researched area, less attention has been paid to the particular challenges in IUCN Category V protected areas. This paper explores the policy and practice of partnership working in a case study Category V area Northumberland National Park, England. Qualitative research was conducted through documentary analysis and semi-structured interviews with a sample of 23 stakeholders involved in the management of this protected area. It was found that a convoluted institutional history has shaped the present day approach to its management. The processes driving partnership working were understood in terms of governance factors with a relatively high degree of control and behavioural factors with a relatively low degree of control. There was a tacit acceptance among actors that success was dependent upon uncontrollable factors and in particular inter-personal relations between representatives of stakeholder bodies. These findings are important for all IUCN Category V protected areas reliant upon working within stakeholder partnerships to achieve sustainable development objectives. Management bodies can benefit from examining the history of these often complex webs of relationships and the implications for communications between organisations if they are to understand the processes that underpin this form of governance.

AB  - In recent years, the notion of "transformation" has moved from academia to the strategic agendas of public and private organizations. Within this discourse, both transdisciplinarity and co-production are often mentioned as means to enable transformation, particularly in debates about risks and opportunities in transformative science and problem-solving. How ever, there has been little systematic examination of the potential in combining these approaches to contribute more effectively in the transformation to sustainability. Building on an autoethnographic analysis of two projects in transformation and transdisciplinarity, we identify pathways to strengthen collaboration between these approaches: 1. moving from transdisciplinarity "for " transformation to transdisciplinarity "as" trans-formation and 2. identifying concrete spaces for conceptual and method-ological cross-fertilization between these approaches. We discuss the challenges and elaborate recommendations for these pathways and conclude by offering a few insights on how communities can together foster effective sustainability solutions to societal challenges.

AB  - PURPOSE: This study seeks to examine the impediments of realising sustainable youth and women's entrepreneurship in a developing country perspective. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: The study used a cross-sectional, quantitative research design based on a sample of 571 selected youth- and women-owned businesses registered with Mbarara district. Given the nature of the study, the analyses performed were largely descriptive. Exploratory factor analysis was performed to test convergent validity. FINDINGS: Key impediments to sustainable entrepreneurship among youth and women relate to government, education, finance, market and infrastructural factors. IMPLICATIONS: Policy -makers need to improve the education system to encourage creativity, self-sufficiency and personal initiative, create continuous mentorship programmes, subsidies and tax exemptions to favour youth and women's entrepreneurship. Also, entrepreneurs need to be persistent and proactive when handling issues, actively attack challenges when they happen to the business, as well as prioritise their stakeholders to achieve sustainability. LIMITATIONS: The study used a self-administered questionnaire for data collection and it is possible that the views held by individuals may change over the years. This study was limited to the women- and youth -owned entrepreneurial firms registered and operating in Mbarara, Uganda, and it is possible that the results are only applicable to this area in Uganda. ORIGINALITY: While there have been a number of studies on youth and women's entrepreneurship, this study generates empirical evidence on the impediments to sustainable youth and women's entrepreneurship in Uganda.

AB  - In the Pacific region, community engagement, participation and empowerment are key to effective and sustainable marine resource management at the local level. With the prevalence of a local marine tenure systems and the widespread decline of coastal resources, communities need to be part of the solution to facilitate recovery. A novel marine monitoring toolkit was developed in Vanuatu with the participation of community resource monitors to inform local management actions. The Toolkit includes simplified versions of established monitoring methods for marine habitats and resources to achieve a balance between robust science and methods appropriate for communities. Key to its success is that it was developed in response to community needs using a participatory approach and implemented through a series of training workshops with local environmental leaders. Of particular note, the Toolkit includes a standardised process for communities to use monitoring results instantly, without the need for complex data analyses or external support. Using the Toolkit, communities are able to adapt their traditional management to address immediate and medium-term issues in their local marine environment. The observed benefits of the Toolkit include increased local awareness through community-led environmental outreach, increased ownership of and motivation for local monitoring and management, implementation of local management actions, expansion of traditional marine managed areas, and new local ecotourism initiatives to generate revenue to support environmental stewardship.

AB  - The connected nature of social-ecological systems has never been more apparent than in today's globalized world. The ecosystem service framework and associated ecosystem assessments aim to better inform the science-policy response to sustainability challenges. Such assessments, however, often overlook distant, diffuse and delayed impacts that are critical for global sustainability. Ecosystem-services science must better recognise the off-stage impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services of place-based ecosystem management, which we term 'ecosystem service burdens'. These are particularly important since they are often negative, and have a potentially significant effect on ecosystem management decisions. Ecosystem-services research can better recognise these off-stage burdens through integration with other analytical approaches, such as life cycle analysis and risk-based approaches that better account for the uncertainties involved. We argue that off-stage ecosystem service burdens should be incorporated in ecosystem assessments such as those led by the Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Taking better account of these off-stage burdens is essential to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of cross-scale interactions, a prerequisite for any sustainability transition.

AB  - Collaborative processes such as co-design are increasingly crucial in generating social-ecological research and practice. Fostering change within complex adaptive systems requires collaboratively working with real-world actors or stakeholders to resolve complicated issues. Co-design is a distinct and fundamental component of the co-paradigm, a collective term for co-design, co-production, and co-creation. However, scientific literature currently provides limited definitions of the key concepts within the co-paradigm, leading to misinterpretations or inconsistent usage. Improving the clarity of these definitions is essential because it permits scientific progress and better implementation of processes and engagement in practice. To address this gap, the following paper presents research which critically examines the practice of co-design through a systematic literature review. Using a systematic approach, this study identifies fifty-two papers with empirical methodologies, which are thematically analysed to understand the purpose and process of the co-design approach within social-ecological research and practice. The paper identifies effective co-design methods and discusses the implications of their utilisation within social-ecological study and practice. The review also identifies and examines definitions of co- design and the challenges of implementing a co-design approach, highlighting potential solutions. The paper concludes by proposing an integrative definition of co-design to further understand and enhance the process's implementation within social-ecological systems. The definition proposed in this paper can serve as a roadmap for researchers and practitioners aiming to use co-design as part of sustainable transformation efforts in social- ecological systems.

AB  - Literature review indicates that systemic agricultural human resource development interventions are rarely carried out in developing countries, and limited knowledge exists about how successful they are. Learning transfer is the generalization of material learned, such as skills acquired or knowledge gained in training, back to the job. The main aim of this study was to analyze factors influencing sustainability learning transfer among farmers participating in Diffusion-Push Plans in Fars Province, Iran. A total number of 120 subjects were selected through stratified random sampling method. Results revealed that performance-outcomes expectations, perceived content validity, transfer design, opportunity to use, supervisor support, years of experience in farming, and age had a significant effect on participants' learning transfer. The formula developed in this study contributes to quantify learning transfer and provides new opportunities for a deeper investigation of causal relationships among learning transfer factors using advanced statistical methods. Farmer training decision makers and other actors in the extension system should pay particular attention to the factors reported here as critical to learning transfer.

KW  - diagnostic framework
KW  - participatory research approaches
KW  - sustainability problems
AB  - Participatory research approaches are often assumed to be effective for addressing sustainability problems that involve a substantial amount of complexity, uncertainty, and conflicting values. The adaptive and integrative character of these approaches engages various scientific and nonscientific actors in collective knowledge production processes. An increasing number of case studies documents pathways to impact triggered by participatory research approaches. However, cumulative learning across cases about the impacts of participatory research projects remains limited to date. One question is of particular interest, namely how and when different intensities of actor interactions in participatory research effectively contribute to advancing sustainable development.
   In this paper we address this knowledge gap by presenting a meta-analysis of 29 case studies of participatory research projects in agricultural settings. The study protocol follows systematic case retrieval and selection, coding, and data analysis through formal concept analysis. We introduce and utilize a new diagnostic framework to analyze the links between the intensity of actor interactions, sustainability impact goals, context conditions, and sustainability impacts. The results show that three archetypical patterns describe how the 29 case studies report that participatory research projects generate sustainability impacts: learning, knowledge products, and real-world transformations. Impact in all three patterns is consistently associated with higher intensities of interactions, i.e., coproduction and less consultation but not mere information. The most frequently reported impact is learning in a context of resources and environment problems. In this configuration, coproduction of knowledge is mainly used during the second research phase. However, the results also show that coproduction in the final phase of a participatory research project is more often used to achieve the impact of real-world transformations, which presumably involves more complexity and contestation than other impacts. We conclude that participatory research projects, which aim at transformative impacts in complex settings beyond knowledge products and learning, need to sustain high intensities of actor interactions in knowledge coproduction throughout all research phases to achieve their sustainability impact goals.

AB  - Improving food security and nutrition in the developing world remains among society's most intractable challenges and continues despite a wide variety of investments. Both donor- and enterprise-led initiatives, for example, have explored including smallholder farmers in their value chains. However, these efforts have had only modest success, partly because the private and development sectors prefer to maintain their independence. Research from the base-of-the-pyramid domain offers new insights into how collaborative interdependence between sectors can enhance the connection between profits and the alleviation of poverty. In this article, we identify the strengths and weaknesses of donor- led and enterprise-led value chain initiatives. We then explore how insights from the base-of-the-pyramid domain yield a set of interdependence-based collaboration strategies that can achieve more sustainable and scalable outcomes.

AB  - In contemporary China, the rapidly urbanized cities are exposed to a broad range of natural and human-made emergencies, such as COVID-19. Responding to emergencies successfully requires widespread participation of local government sectors that engages in diversified collaboration behaviors across organizational boundaries for achieving sustainability. However, the multi-organizational collaborative process is highly dynamic and complex, as well as its outcomes are uncertain underlying the emergency response network. Examining characteristics of the collaborative process and exploring how collaborative behaviors local governmental sectors engaging in the impact their perceived outcomes is essential to understand how disastrous situations are addressed by collaborative efforts in emergency management. This research investigates diversified collaborative behaviors in emergency response and then examines this using a multi-dimensional model consisting of joint decision making, joint implementation, compromised autonomy, resource sharing, and trust building. We surveyed 148 local governments and their affiliated sectors in China in-depth understanding how collaborative processes contribute to perceived outcomes from perspectives of participating sectors in the context of a centralized political-administrative system. A structural equation model (SEM) is employed to encode multiple dimensions of the collaborative process, perceived outcomes, as well as their relationships. The empirical finding indicates that joint decision making and implementation positively affect the perceived outcomes significantly. The empirical results indicate that joint decision making and joint implementation affect perceived outcomes significantly. Instead, resource sharing and trust building do not affect the outcomes positively as expected. Additionally, compromised autonomy negatively affects the collaborative outcomes. We also discuss the institutional advantages for achieving successful outcomes in emergency management in China by reducing the degree of compromised autonomy. Our findings provide insight that can improve efforts to build and maintain a collaborative process to respond to emergencies.

AB  - The extant literature on mobile learning in higher education has mainly focused on students and academics. This study conducted in a Nigerian university considered a wider group of stakeholders (students, academics, IT personnel, and administrative leaders) in its investigation of stakeholders' awareness, willingness, and readiness for mobile learning adoption, using a mixed methods approach. The findings revealed that while the awareness of mobile learning amongst students was low, they were keen on adoption. Academics were more tentative, for while they were willing, it was clear that a shift in their teaching philosophy and pedagogy would be required for mobile learning to work effectively. For those in IT and administrative leadership roles, their perceptions were more resource-focused. While this study only considered the views of internal stakeholders, it also uncovered the need for the involvement of external stakeholders. Building on these findings, a strategy table which outlines the roles and responsibilities of each stakeholder group was created. The table provides a blueprint which otherwise has been missing, to guide sustainable mobile learning adoption and implementation not only in higher education in developing countries, but which may have more global appeal.

AB  - In an increasingly globalized world, the imperative of sustainable development underscores the pivotal role of education and professional culture in nurturing sustainability-oriented mindsets and actions. This paper aims to explore the nexus between educational practices, professional culture, and sustainable development goals, particularly within the context of the Ukrainian national educational system and professional community. Through a comprehensive review of literature and empirical analysis, the study elucidates that the integration of sustainable development into educational curricula and professional ethos fosters heightened awareness and conscientious engagement with global environmental, economic, and social challenges. It underscores the significance of organizational cultures characterized by adaptability, innovation, and collaborative learning in advancing sustainable development agendas. However, effective implementation necessitates proactive strategies adaptable to evolving societal demands. The research advocates for the augmentation of interdisciplinary educational programs coupling theoretical insights with practical applications tailored to address realworld sustainable development challenges. Furthermore, it underscores the importance of incentivizing participation in sustainable development initiatives among educators and students alike, leveraging innovative learning technologies. Future research avenues should center on assessing the efficacy of such initiatives and devising methodologies for monitoring and evaluating their societal impact, thereby advancing sustainable development objectives.

AB  - Community public safety is facing great challenges in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. While helping communities identify crises and prevent risks, and improving community public safety governance, collaborative governance is changing the trends of a complex, uncertain, and ever-changing environment, and helping to drive communities toward higher levels of development and improved community sustainability. The purpose of this paper was to design a model of collaborative governance regime (CGR) that better fits the particular context of COVID-19 to enhance community safety and achieve sustainability of collaborative governance. This paper investigated and empirically analyzed the COVID-19 response in Chinese and Korean communities. It is found that collaborative dynamics can positively contribute to collaborative performance; collaborative dynamics can positively contribute to collaborative actions; collaborative actions can positively contribute to collaborative performance; collaborative actions play a partially mediating role between collaborative dynamics and collaborative performance; and there is heterogeneity in collaborative governance regimes in different system contexts. The paper suggests several insights: collaborative governance can deal with uncertainty and unpredictable turbulence; enhancing the capacity for joint action is more conducive to collaborative performance; and the role of government in collaborative governance is valued. Our study provides data support for validating the operating principles and internal logical relationships of collaborative governance and provides an empirical basis for responding to large-scale public crises in different contexts.

AB  - Sustainable residential buildings and a sustainable housing development ('sustainable housing') are key factors in the sustainability strategy of the German government. Certification systems have been developed to assess sustainable housing and to better inform stakeholders and hence improve sustainability in the housing sector. Currently, however, a variety of different certification systems exists to assess sustainable housing using different sets of indicators. The supply of different certification systems to measure the same ('sustainability') raises questions of validity of the assessment instruments. Also, different stakeholders hold different interests with regard to sustainability certification systems, which leads to investigate the legitimacy of certification systems. In this study, we applied the theory of social institutions to investigate legitimacy of sustainability certification in the housing sector. To find out about the validity of sustainability measurement, this article presents a survey where real estate stakeholders were asked to evaluate indicators applied by different sustainability certification systems. Results showed high heterogeneity of tastes towards indicators of sustainable housing. Results also identified potential 'areas of conflicts' where stakeholders differed most widely in the evaluation of indicators. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Social learning in multi-actor innovation networks is increasingly considered an important precondition for addressing sustainability in regional development contexts. Social learning is seen as a means for enabling stakeholders to take advantage of the diversity in perspectives, interests and values for generating more sustainable practices and policies. Although more and more research is done on the meaning and manifestations of social learning, particularly in the context of natural resource management, little is known about the social dynamics in the process of social learning. In this contribution an integrated hypothetical framework that provides a better understanding of social learning as a generative process with outcomes is presented. This hypothetical framework is grounded theoretically in emergent social learning theory and empirically in a retrospective case study around multi-stakeholder sustainability-oriented regional learning in the North of The Netherlands. Our findings indicate that trust, commitment and reframing are interrelated aspects and emergent properties of interaction in the process of social learning. Hence, the framework presented reflects social learning as a dynamic process, in which trust, commitment and reframing are continuously produced and reproduced through the (inter)actions of the individual actors.

AB  - PurposeThis paper aims to propose a plan-do-check-act-oriented framework for implementing the "Sustainability circles" (SCs) approach to achieve sustainability excellence within higher education institutions (HEIs).Design/methodology/approachThe SCs approach, derived from the quality circles concept, involves groups of individuals working together to promote sustainability within HEIs. This paper demonstrates the application of this approach through a case study of the University of Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates, establishing clear links between sustainable development goals (SDGs), the Universitas Indonesia (UI) GreenMetric Ranking System and SCs.FindingsThe case study revealed that SCs significantly impacted the achievement of SDGs and improved the university's rankings in the UI GreenMetric within a short period. The SC approach effectively engaged a wide range of stakeholders, including students, academic and administrative staff.Research limitations/implicationsBy involving students, faculty and administrative staff in SCs, HEIs can embed sustainability into their institutional culture, developing new ideas and innovative solutions. The SCs approach effectively increases the number of points gained from respective sustainability ranking systems and their evaluation categories, showcasing its strength and novelty in driving engagement and sustainability excellence.Practical implicationsThe SC approach provides HEIs with a structured method to overcome sustainability challenges by fostering collaboration, innovation and stakeholder engagement. This framework can accelerate the achievement of SDGs and enhance sustainability practices within HEIs.Social implicationsThe SCs approach impacts the society by equipping students with sustainability awareness and critical problem-solving skills to address real-world sustainability challenges. Consequently, these students take an active part in developing a more aware, engaged and proactive society.Originality/valueThis paper introduces an innovative application of the quality circles concept to sustainability within HEIs, addressing the significant challenge of integrating and involving both top-level leadership and bottom-level stakeholders. The proposed SC approach effectively bridges this gap by combining top-down and bottom-up strategies, fostering collaboration and engagement across all levels. This novel framework demonstrates how HEIs can overcome barriers to sustainability implementation, ensuring comprehensive participation and accelerating the achievement of SDGs.

AB  - Undertaking environmental assessments for small, rural development projects has proven to be both vexing and essential. Our research considers one approach to assessing such projects, community-based environmental assessment (CBEA). The purpose of our work was to gauge current CBEA practice and consider next generation approaches in the face of challenges such as lack of adequate capacity, resource and power imbalances, achieving meaningful participation, narrow conceptions of sustainability, and weak follow-up and monitoring. Through a literature review and semi-structured interviews with various EA experts from around the globe, we consider these issues and propose a framework for next-generation community-based environmental assessment (NG-CBEA) that builds on four key next generation themes; sustainability, meaningful public participation, follow-up and monitoring, and learning.

AB  - Public participation in development planning is critical for achieving sustainable development outcomes. Even though participation is still evolving, the existing theoretical models indicate that implementing public participation enhances responsiveness to community needs, leverages diverse skills, and instills a sense of ownership for sustainable development projects. Although Kenya has made strides in ensuring citizens' participation in local government development processes, local authorities and other stakeholders still find the existing public participation inadequate, marginalizing the needs of the local citizens in development planning. This paper aims to explore the current status and determine the factors that affect the active participation of citizens in development planning by examining the preparation process of the 2023- 2027 County Integrated Development Plans for Nairobi and Makueni Counties in Kenya. The intention was to enhance participation by devising strategies for sustainable participation practices. Based on the case study approach, involving literature review and textual analysis of key documents and county-specific County Integrated Development plans retrieved from official online sources, the results revealed that Nairobi and Makueni counties have distinct approaches and challenges in public participation. Despite budget constraints and perceived citizen apathy, Nairobi addresses historical service delivery issues through diverse mechanisms like social media and town hall meetings. Makueni excels in inclusivity using comprehensive matrices, but low budget allocation hinders participation. Both counties aim to enhance participation, with Makueni emphasizing innovative civic empowerment through citizen schools and promoting inclusive decision-making. Unfortunately, the impacts of participation could not be evaluated in both cases because the plans lack a dedicated section on the approach to public participation used to develop the plans. These results imply the need for more studies on the impacts of participation and the effects of integrating technology, such as AI, in participation to promote efficiency in the use of scarce county resources.

AB  - The outbreak of COVID-19 evoked a heated discussion of its drivers and extensive impacts on achieving sustainable development goals. Considering the deepening global interconnectedness and complex human-environment interactions, it calls for a clarity of the two concepts of risk governance and sustainability and their relationships. In this paper, a comprehensive review was provided based on scientometric analysis. A total number of 1156 published papers were studied and a considerable increase of interest in this line of research was found. The research outputs show the interdisciplinary feature of this field but with a focus on environmental issues. The journal "Sustainability " was found to be the most productive journal. Geographic and institutional focus on the line of research were also visualized. Five salient research themes were identified as follows: (1) Resilience and adaptation to climate change; (2) Urban risk governance and sustainability; (3) Environmental governance and transformation; (4) Collaborative governance and policy integration; and (5) Corporate governance and sustainability. This paper provides insights into the heterogeneity of the risk governance and sustainability research. Additionally, the study unveiled the implicit relationship linking risk governance and sustainability: risk governance can be a process of participation and coordination, and a means of coping with the uncertainty and complexity to achieve sustainable outcomes. On the other hand, risk governance is a constant aim to be optimized in the process of sustainable development.

AB  - That collaboration has always been the foundation of human development as well as the coping strategy of some animal species is a view widely shared by scholars. In fact, no individual, organization or nation can produce everything it needs without collaboration. Therefore, nations and organizations use the concept of the triple helix as a collaborative tool to find solutions for commercial and social challenges. However, the main challenge of the model when applied has always been how to ensure its sustainability and its outcomes. Central to this challenge is the rationalist paradigm adopted in its conception and implementation, especially in an African context where communal and collectivist values are features of the society. Therefore, this paper advances a different model of collaboration. The African philosophy of Ubuntu is used as the framework for the conception and application of the triple helix. Our approach is grounded on the assumption that "culture" is one of the key determining success factors in sustainable collaboration. The approach requires a change in mindset and organizational structure and culture. Our practical approach to addressing the needed change is supported by renowned scholars in management.

The investigation of social learning processes within participatory decision-making is challenging, and capturing all aspects in one research design does not seem possible. The systematic review undertaken in this paper found that qualitative methods and self-reporting techniques are commonly applied to measure social learning. Existing studies assessing social learning processes often lack a critical reflection of the assessment method and sometimes provide little detail on the method applied. To address this shortcoming, this paper presents a methodological review of the strengths and weaknesses of qualitative and quantitative methods as well as further research techniques for measuring social learning. The paper contributes to the current debate by enabling a better understanding of the explanatory power of results deduced using a specific research technique or method. Recommendations are made to address the challenges involved in investigating social learning in interaction settings such as participatory decision-making. To improve our understanding of how participation processes contribute to sustainable development, more diverse studies must be conducted.

AB  - The Laval University Faculty of Medicine, Faculty of Nursing, and School of Social Work, in partnership with the Vieille-Capitale Health and Social Services Centre in Quebec City, obtained funding from Health Canada to design, implement, and evaluate an integrated interprofessional education (IPE) program for family medicine, nursing, and social work students and for professionals from those professions working in primary care. The program was developed around four components and produced the following outcomes: a 45-hour undergraduate curriculum; IPE practical training for professionals, supervisors, residents and trainees in primary care teaching settings; a continuing education model for professionals based on a coaching approach, and; information and communication technology resources. After briefly describing the implementation process, educational content, and evaluation highlights of each component, the integrated program is discussed with respect to the inter-area complementarities and coherence with the conceptual dimensions that have guided the development of the program: IPE, collaboration, and collaborative patient-centered practice. The positive evaluation outcomes, the sustainability of the educational activities, and the enthusiasm of the different partners led to the creation of the Collaborative Network on Interprofessional Practices at Laval University and its affiliated health and social services clinical network.

AB  - Purpose Doctoral candidates possess specialized knowledge that could support sustainability transitions. Doctoral education, however, often focusses on discipline-specific topics and working methods, making it difficult to "see the bigger picture". This summer school on wood construction gathered doctoral candidates from different fields to explore how solutions to complex sustainability issues could be found by working together across disciplines and by engaging multiple stakeholders. The purpose of this study is to report the pedagogical approaches taken and to understand whether these fostered the candidates' ability to develop systemic solutions and professional competency. Design/methodology/approach Twenty doctoral candidates from various backgrounds participated in a two-week summer school organized by a consortium of four universities. Interdisciplinary groups worked on real-life challenges using a systemic approach to co-create tangible solutions. To support the creation of socio-technical innovations, stakeholders and experts from different fields were involved. The participants completed two questionnaires during the summer school to help elucidate their learning experiences. Findings The doctoral candidates showed strong willingness to cooperate across disciplines, though they found it important to connect this learning experience to their research. The candidates reported that the experience enhanced their ability to work in a multidisciplinary capacity. The experience identified a solid basis for interdisciplinary learning principles that could be replicated. Originality/value The summer school focussed on an innovative learning experience based on a systems thinking approach and the development of interdisciplinary capacity in the research-business ecosystem.

AB  - Review of literature on relevance and utility of geo-ecological studies revealed that these were applied to deal with various issues of geo-ecosystem such as natural resources management, characterization of ecosystems, characterization of landscapes, soil, environment, climate change, and vegetation modeling. It was observed that the period from 1970 to 1990 was the conceptual phase of geo-ecological studies and its applications gained momentum after 1990. Though reported from limited regions worldwide, geo-ecological applications have yielded significant results, however, their potential is not fully utilized. There is a need to adopt and popularize geo-ecology to deal with complex geo-ecosystem issues using modern geospatial tools like remote sensing and geographic information system. These tools are capable of multilayered analyses of voluminous baseline data required for geo-ecological investigations. A comprehensive geo-ecological information system (GEIS) may also be created for a region, which will act as decision support system for planners and administrators.

AB  - The challenges formulated within the Future Earth framework set the orientation for research programmes in sustainability science for the next ten years. Scientific disciplines from natural and social science will collaborate both among each other and with relevant societal groups in order to define the important integrated research questions, and to explore together successful pathways towards global sustainability. Such collaboration will be based on transdisciplinarity and integrated research concepts. This paper analyses the relationship between scientific integration and transdisciplinarity, discusses the dimensions of integration of different knowledge and proposes a platform and a paradigm for research towards global sustainability that will be both designed and conducted in partnership between science and society. We argue that integration is an iterative process that involves reflection among all stakeholders. It consists of three stages: co-design, co-production and co-dissemination.

AB  - A widely held assumption is that intensifying agroforestry will lead to sustainable increases in production, societal resilience and food security, urgently needed in the current context of changes in markets, climate and demography. Current thinking assumes that to achieve sustainable innovation a participatory approach with public, civil and private stakeholders is necessary, combined with a systemic, trans-disciplinary approach, rather than a technical approach. This study presents a case of applying the Theory of Change (ToC) concept to test this assumption. The ToC was designed to articulate the process of scaling of action-research findings, and to adapt the research to the context of complex agroforestry systems at plot, household, farm, village and landscape levels. This allowed to develop an intervention logic that unpacks what sustainability means for farmers and other local stakeholders in four West African agroforestry systems. The conceptual approach created an awareness of potential impacts of scaling initiatives based on a ToC with pathways to impact combined with monitoring the effects of the research & development project on a variety of ecological, agronomic and economic performance indicators. A number of constraints and paradoxes that are linked to current research and development short term funding are also discussed.

AB  - Indonesia's severely flawed centralized wastewater treatment system has caused economic and socioeconomic losses for decades. An alternative system has been called for under a national-scale program called Sanimas or Community-Led Total Sanitation (CLTS), which would cater to 50-100 urban families in every intervention with urgent needs through the operation of a decentralized wastewater treatment system. Through household participation, this program features a co-production system wherein the national-level government initiates and provides initial funding until construction, after which a community-appointed social organization takes over. This study implemented a multicriteria approach to assess sustainability in Sanimas communities in Jakarta: 67 in Menteng (Central Jakarta) and At-Taubah in Koja (North Jakarta). Connected households and facility-operating committees were questioned separately for their opinions on six aspects that explained the survival of the establishment of a facility: technical, management, community participation, financial, institutional, and environmental. We found that although the facility's excellence and overall satisfaction with the program were unanimous, Koja and Menteng showed substantial differences in management, institutional, and financial aspects, largely due to administrative policies, payment contributions, and committee commitments. Interviews revealed that periodic testing of the treated water was neglected, against the provided guidance. In conclusion, communities have come to focus more on the technical functionalities of the installation, regardless of the state of the management, which is indisputable not only in Menteng but also in Koja. Finally, we argue that although decentralized systems can substitute centralized systems, they still require stringent and adequate support in quality control and troubleshooting.

AB  - Addressing complex sustainability issues in higher education requires the combination and integration of various disciplines, perspectives and approaches. Challenge-Based Learning (CBL) can support interdisciplinary collaboration on sustainability issues. It requires students to actively explore, discuss, reflect on and integrate information and methods from various disciplines. Online learning could enhance interdisciplinary collaboration since it is associated with greater geographical and educational flexibility and accessibility. Applying an active learning approach such as CBL in an online setting is believed to support interdisciplinary learning and collaboration. We present a case study that took place in a 10-week online interdisciplinary, inter-university undergraduate course on sustainability education. Our research is based on well-known online learning theories "Transactional distance" and "Community of Inquiry" (CoI). The aim of this study was to investigate how transactional distance, presence and (online) interdisciplinary learning are perceived by students. 23 undergraduate students from three universities were enrolled in the course. Quantitative survey data (N = 13) and qualitative data from student reflection papers and interviews (N = 15) were collected. Students perceived low levels of transactional distance and high levels of presence. Unexpectedly, a small increase in perceived distance between students was measured which could be explained by reported limitations of the course design. Students valued the open, interactive and creative character of the course and the online format was not perceived as hindering. Students reflected on interdisciplinary competences that they developed during the course. This study is a first step towards future national as well as international interdisciplinary, inter-university educational collaboration on sustainability issues.

AB  - Upland farming provides important benefits to society. To retain these benefits, measures to encourage farms to adopt practices that balance economic, environmental and social aspects of sustainability are required. This study used survey data from a sample of farms located in less-favoured areas in Northern England to identify the trade-offs between the three dimensions of farm-level sustainability and the impacts of farm behaviours on them, including diversification, participation in agri-environmental policies and stakeholder management. Results showed that farm businesses may face a trade-off between improving economic and environmental performance through their decisions about participating in agri-environmental schemes and that strengthening relationships with some stakeholders is critical for achieving sustainability. This suggests that future policy design may simultaneously improve three dimensions of sustainability by promoting environmental conservation activities through non-economic incentives and by encouraging farm businesses to build good working relationships with their stakeholders.

AB  - In recent years, the international community is struggling to achieve sustainable economic and environmental goals. Despite of the large literature, the impact of blue economy on sustainable growth and environment is missing, for the case of Saudi Arabia. The current study incorporates the energy, green, and blue indicators to examine the impact on sustainable goals of Saudi Arabia. For econometric estimations, we use the nonlinear ARDL approach to estimate the full sample and post-Vision 2030 sample. The findings confirm that blue economic activities are not mature enough to participate its role to achieve sustainable targets of Saudi Vision 2030. The outcomes of current study depict that blue indicators are neglected to attain sustainable economic and environmental goals. In view of econometric outcomes, we propose that Saudi Arabia have to emphasize on sea trade and ocean tourism. Moreover, the findings are useful to estimate the sustainable targets of Saudi Vision 2030.

AB  - The rapid expansion of the cultural industry and the escalating demand for innovation have led to a growing attention on the sustainable development of cultural and creative parks. This study aims to provide a comprehensive review and prospectus of the literature on the sustainable development of these parks using CiteSpace knowledge mapping. We analyzed 662 publications from 2012 to 2023 in the Web of Science database using bibliometric methods, such as descriptive statistical analysis, network analysis, and co-citation analysis. Our findings indicate that research hotspots in the sustainable development of cultural and creative parks focus on cultural ecosystems, environmental conservation, cultural landscapes, creative tourism, park management, and urban renewal. Three primary research themes emerged: ecological service systems, assessment models, and multidimensional value. We propose five future prospects: (1) diversifying sustainable development strategies; (2) coordinating development with urban, regional, and global sustainable development goals; (3) enhancing interdisciplinary research; (4) deepening stakeholder participation; and (5) improving the evaluation index system for sustainable development. This study offers a systematic guiding framework for constructing multidimensional value for the sustainable development of cultural and creative parks, providing valuable insights for future theoretical and practical research.

AB  - While the term sustainability has been used in a broad range of literatures, disciplines and contexts; sustainability in the context of humanitarian logistics (HL) has been given less attention and integration (Halldorsson and Kovacs 2010). Sustainable humanitarian logistics (SHL) planning and decision-making in response to natural disasters implies innovative, socially responsible, and proactive decisionmaking by logisticians that minimizes negative impacts, and enables long-term maintenance of community wellbeing, while maintaining a balance between social, environmental, and economic goals. This chapter outlines important assumptions from the existing literature on HL about its nature, processes and activities; and discusses unaddressed issues of environmental responsibility, community participation in disaster response and sustainability that are not currently addressed by the HL literature. Using case examples of natural disaster response and recovery, and associated logistical response in Australia as examples, the chapter illustrates the range and types of response and recovery-related logistical activities that contribute to sustainability in the field of HL, and from which a SHL planning and decisionmaking framework is proposed.

AB  - The promotion of corporate social responsibility (CSR) is important for achieving sustainability. The interest of stakeholders is one factor promoting CSR activities. Consumers are one of the major stakeholders. The aim of this study is to quantify Japanese consumers' preference for 13 CSR activities using the best-worst scaling (BWS) approach. We conducted an online survey in February 2015 and 633 individuals responded. Counting analysis and econometric analysis were used to analyze the BWS data. The results of the counting and MaxDiff analyses show that Product safety and immediate recall in the case of defects was identified as the most highly evaluated activity that makes respondents most strongly think that they want to buy a product from a company implementing the CSR activity. The results of the random parameter logit model and latent class model show preference heterogeneity. Some classes prioritize activities that do not generate a private benefit for them, such as environmental issues abroad and the working conditions of employees.

AB  - Previous sustainability engineering education studies have suggested the importance of problem-based learning, project-based learning, team-based learning, and interdisciplinary learning. Place-based learning, interacting with outdoors, and building sustainable communities are also important aspects of sustainability education, yet relatively little has been published on how to use these pedagogical approaches in engineering education. The goal of this paper was to illustrate the implementation of all these pedagogical approaches in a graduate-level sustainability engineering education class. Fink's taxonomy of significant learning and the University of Toledo's Outdoor Classroom Garden provided the framework for this implementation. Throughout the semester, sustainability engineering students worked toward an engineering solution for how to water the University of Toledo's outdoor classroom garden. They also estimated the life-cycle cost and environmental impacts of their proposed solutions. The garden project and the design of the course provided many different learning opportunities that might be absent in a traditional civil engineering class. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)EI.1943-5541.0000051.

AB  - Biomass is a promising feedstock for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the chemical industry. Biomass availability, however, is limited. Still, many bio-based processes focus on producing a single product. Thereby, valuable feedstock potential is often lost with undesired co-products. In this study, we assess the environmental and economic potential of bio-based multi-product systems and provide insights on the sustainability benefits of co-producing hydrogen and high-value acids from bio-alcohols compared to fossil and green alternatives. We select dehydrogenation as a promising early-stage technology for producing hydrogen and four co-product candidates: formic acid, acetic acid, lactic acid, and succinic acid. All investigated dehydrogenation multi-product systems show the potential to reduce climate impacts and to become profitable. A higher carbon tax can improve the economic potential. Acetic acid is the most promising co-product compared to both fossil and green benchmarks with potential benefits in various environmental impact categories. In contrast, co-producing lactic acid shows substantial trade-offs compared to the benchmark technologies. Expected eutrophication impacts associated with biomass use occur in all dehydrogenation routes. Our analysis highlights that multi-product systems can increase benefits compared to single-product systems from both environmental and economic perspectives.

AB  - Upon return to campus after the pandemic, students were subjected to receiving lectures online, in class, or by the emerging hybrid approaches. This study reports students' preference over the three approaches based on the experience gained during the 2022/23 academic session. The study aimed to understand the post-pandemic considerations/factors likely to influence students' preferences for or against any of the three modes (based on their experiences with each), and implications for developing university sustainability frameworks in the post-pandemic era. One hundred and twenty-seven (127) on-campus Education students in one public university in Malaysia participated in the study. Data were collected through an online forum and interviews with the participants. The data collected were analyzed using content and thematic analysis. Preference for the hybrid approach emerged as a key finding for this study. Additionally, a perceived lack of Faculty engagement and support in the online learning environment, and on-campus learner-environment challenges were identified as factors contributing to the decreased popularity of the online-only class option in the post-pandemic era. Conversely, students' engagement through faculty presence and technology innovation in class and online emerged as factors that made the hybrid approach the most popular. What the students valued the most in the hybrid approach is the face-to-face interaction that is retained, and the in-class faculty's innovative use of technology in content delivery, which they believed made learning more effective and interesting in class than online. These findings imply that institutions should prioritize technology integration into face-to-face instruction, leveraging innovative approaches to enhance student engagement and sustainable learning outcomes.

AB  - The growing societal and political focus on sustainability at global level is pressurizing companies to enhance their environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance to satisfy respective stakeholder needs and ensure sustained business success. With a data sample of 4292 companies from Europe, East Asia and North America, this work aims to prove through a cross-regional empirical study that quality management systems (QMSs) and environmental management systems (EMSs) represent powerful business tools to achieve this enhanced ESG performance. Descriptive and cluster analyses reveal that firms with QMSs and/or EMSs accomplish statistically significant higher ESG scores than companies without such management systems (MSs). Furthermore, the results indicate that operating both types of MSs simultaneously increases performance in the environmental and social pillar even further, while the governance dimension appears to be affected mainly by the adoption of EMSs alone. To the best of the authors' knowledge, such large-scale, cross-regional analysis of the impact of QMSs and EMSs on ESG performance is absent from the literature, thus paving the way for pioneering academic research. The study is grounded in stakeholder theory and demonstrates managers how the implementation of MSs can assist in successfully translating stakeholders' sustainability concerns into actionable business practice. Furthermore, it allows decision-makers to gain insight into the strengths and weaknesses of QMSs and EMSs for tackling specific ESG issues and highlights the performance advantages of combining both MSs. The work also depicts policymakers how corporate sustainable performance (CSP) can be improved by fostering MSs adoption, thereby emphasizing the importance of supporting and facilitating the diffusion of these systems.

AB  - The complexity of the sustainability challenge demands for collaboration between different actors, be they governments, businesses, or grassroots movements, at all levels. Nevertheless, and according to previous research, many tensions and obstacles to partnership still exist and results are far from meaningful. By investigating potential synergies, our purpose is to define a sustainability framework to promote better collaboration between community-based initiatives and local governments, in the context of transformation. Specifically, the research aim presented in this paper is to harvest learnings from existing collaborative experiments at the municipal level. As a starting point and using exploratory literature review concerning areas like policy (e.g., public administration) or business and management research, we propose a 'Compass for Collaborative Transformation'. This heuristic device can support the study of these sustainability experiments. We also introduce a method to map the governance imprint of these collaborations and to provide a 'proxy' of transformative efforts. We then present and discuss results from 71 surveyed cases happening in 16 countries in America and Europe, comparing distinctive frameworks involved. Finally, we consider the preconditions of a framework to improve these local collaborations-namely the capacity to support joint navigation through transformative efforts, facing high levels of uncertainty and complexity-and present ongoing efforts to codesign a new sustainability framework.

AB  - . Current post-carbon transition trajectories are primarily focused on external solutions, while citizens' inner lives and roles in collective transformation and system change processes are largely overlooked. To address this gap, this study aims to explore the potential role of citizens as active agents of change. Specifically, it examines how citizens perceive and address climate change, the factors that can empower and motivate them to act, and how they imagine future transformation pathways and their own role within them. Based on a combined SenseMaker and Grounded Theory methodology, we explore citizens' perspectives and discuss their implications for improving current approaches and discourses, such as lifestyle environmentalism and post-growth. Our findings provide important insights into the interplay between people's motivation, sense of agency, and social paradigms, with direct implications for policy and practice. They show that the materialistic growth paradigm under which most people act does not support motivation and engagement in sustainability transformations. Secondly, although intrinsic motivation, along with values such as care and community, increase engagement and transformation, they are seldom reflected in current policy approaches and discourses. Thirdly, a sense of agency is key for lasting individual and collective engagement. Put together, the results indicate that empowering individual and collective agency requires challenging current societal and systemic values that lie at the root of today's crises. Supporting conditions that allow the emergence of new social paradigms through targeted actions at individual, collective, and system levels is thus crucial to tackling climate change and meeting policy targets.

AB  - Sustainability leadership aims at balancing short-term economic goals with long-term sustainable development goals by considering the interests of all stakeholders instead of just shareholders and focusing on a triple bottom line: people, planet, and profit. The existing research on sustainability leadership has mainly focused on the role of individual competencies without considering other meso and macro level factors that can impact the enactment of sustainable leadership. The studies that have considered these micro, meso, and macro levels have conceptualized these levels as stratified and discrete, assuming a hierarchical relationship between them. Such a conceptualization constitutes an impediment to the dynamic communication and engagement that is necessary to the achievement of sustainability goals. Drawing on stakeholder theory, this study investigates the key factors impacting the practice of sustainability leadership in a contextually relevant manner. More specially, we propose a multi-level, multi-stakeholder framework for sustainability leadership that is data driven and supported by evidence. This framework is meant to portray a holistic model that is dynamic and reciprocal in the manner in which micro, meso and macro factors impact each other. Qualitative research methods and purposive sampling were used for four stages of data collection, from 39 individuals with diverse profiles across the sustainable-engineering sector. The data collected were analyzed thematically, and the findings formed the basis of the dynamic inclusive business model for sustainability proposed in this paper, which challenges the traditional hierarchical business models. The data-driven, multi-level, multi-stakeholder framework proposed in this work extends the literature by providing insights on the key factors that impact the practice of sustainability leadership in the context of SMEs, operating in an emerging market. This framework demonstrates that the effective practice of sustainability leadership by SMEs is influenced by the interplay of factors at micro, meso and macro levels, as represented by individuals, organizations/firms, and governments.

AB  - Purpose - The present environmental concern has enforced manufacturing firms to re-evaluate their business practices to reduce the adverse impact on the environment with optimum production. Therefore, the present study aims to deal with the implementation of the environmental lean six sigma (ELSS) framework in an Indian medical equipment manufacturing industry to obtain operational and environmental sustainability.
   Design/methodology/approach - The proposed ELSS framework is based on the DMAIC (Define-Measure-Analyze-Improve-Control) methodology, sustainability and lean tools. The efficacy of the developed framework is tested through a case study in an Indian medical equipment manufacturing unit.
   Findings - In the case company, four major issues were reported, i.e. improper material handling, nonproductive movement of men and material, poor indoor air quality and rework. The ELSS project facilitates the case organization to enhance their capacity utilization from 59.25% to 74.3%, defects per million opportunities reduce from 309,523 to 48,951.44 and indoor air quality levels decrease from 156.87 to 86.85 mu g/(m)3.
   Research limitations/implications - The efficacy of the developed ELSS framework is evaluated through a case study conducted only in one Indian manufacturing environment.
   Practical implications - The present study facilitates industrial managers and practitioners to achieve sustainability and process excellence through ELSS implementation. Organizations that intend to simultaneously improve operational and environmental performance can benefit from this paper as it can be used as a guide to conduct similar projects with both operational and environmental benefits.
   Originality/value - This paper presents a successful implementation of the ELSS framework in the healthcare industry to achieve operational and environmental sustainability.

AB  - Although there has been a growing interest in understanding the influence of corporate social responsibility (CSR) on business outcomes, the specific mechanisms through which CSR impacts financial performance (FP) and competitive advantage (CA) remain underexplored, particularly in the context of the food industry. This study contributes to the literature by looking into the mediating effect of innovation and the moderating role of CA in the relationship between CSR and FP in Saudi Arabian food industry companies. Employing Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM), data were collected from executive managers of these companies to assess how CSR practices foster innovation and, consequently, enhance financial outcomes and competitive positioning. The results reveal that CSR significantly improves FP and CA, primarily when focused on innovation. Moreover, CA does not influence the strength or direction of the relationship between CSR and FP. This research offers essential guidance for food industry managers to integrate CSR into core business strategies, foster innovation, and strengthen stakeholder relationships, thereby achieving sustainable growth and profitability.

AB  - Marine citizenship is a relatively new field of enquiry and research to date has focused on individual pro-environmental behaviour change as an expression of responsibility towards the ocean. The field is underpinned by knowledge-deficit and technocratic approaches to behaviour change such as awareness raising, ocean literacy, and environmental attitudes research. In this paper we develop an interdisciplinary and inclusive conceptualisation of marine citizenship. We use mixed methods to study the views and experiences of active marine citizens in the United Kingdom to broaden understandings of marine citizens' characterisation of marine citizenship, and their perceptions of its importance in policy- and decision-making. Our study shows that marine citizenship entails more than individual pro-environmental behaviours, and includes public-facing and socially collective political actions. We contextualise the role of knowledge, finding more complexity than normative knowledge-deficit approaches permit. We illustrate the importance of a rights-based framing of marine citizenship which incorporates political and civic rights to participate in the transformation of the human-ocean relationship for sustainability. Recognising this more inclusive approach to marine citizenship, we propose an expanded definition to support further exploration of the multiple dimensions and complexities of marine citizenship and to enhance its benefits for marine policy and management.

AB  - Although servant leadership has emerged as an important community-oriented leadership approach that is desirable for public organizations, relatively less research attention has been devoted to understanding its antecedents as well as its organizational and community-level consequences. Drawing on self-categorization and stakeholder theories, this study investigates the antecedents and consequences of servant leadership in local government agencies using a comparative analysis of three case studies (two counties and a city). Findings highlight two frameworks of antecedents and consequences of servant leadership in local governance: (1) the underlying mechanisms-translating antecedents into servant leadership and (2) the intervening mechanisms-translating as organizational and community-level consequences of servant leadership. These findings have implications for both public sector leadership theory and practice. Theoretically, servant leadership emerges as an inclusive approach that fosters stakeholder engagement and community prosperity in local governments. Practically, the findings suggest a pathway for utilizing servant leadership as an instrument for potential selection, training, succession planning, and servant leadership development in local government managers.
   Evidence for practice
   Antecedents such as servant identity and moral potency are vital to develop local government managers and employees as servant leaders.
   Servant leadership framework for local governance consists of five dimensions: (1) empathy and concern for people, (2) behaving ethically, (3) conceptual skills, (4) creating value for the community, and (5) follower centric dimensions- putting subordinates first, empowerment, and helping subordinates grow and succeed.
   Servant leaders utilize listening, communication, and negotiation to achieve organizational and community service goals in local government organizations.
   Servant leadership is a community focused approach which is inclusive to the interests and concerns of both internal as well as external stakeholders in local government organizations. This results in building trust and sustainable partnerships with stakeholders and overall community well-being and prosperity.

AB  - Recently, environmental issues have increased, whereas the Earth's natural resources have deteriorated. These problems have forced people and companies to engage in environmental economics to achieve sustainability. However, several barriers have been identified in the implementation of environmental economics. This literature review provides insights into environmental economics and the sustainable development goals (SDGs), as well as the correlation between these two subjects in general. Thus, information about potential barriers to the implementation of environmental economics and possible solutions will be presented. A total of 75 documents were analyzed, including articles, books, official reports, or paperwork from governments and/or related institutions. This study is beneficial, especially for developing countries that are just preparing for, or in the process of conducting, the initial implementation of environmental economics, as well as achieving the sustainable development goals. Interdisciplinary topics that integrate human aspects with environmental economics are limited yet crucial for future research.

In the Study, the comparative analysis has been done for examining AKISs of conventional and ecological raisin farming in the Manisa Province of Turkey. According to the findings, outsider actors direct both the AKISs. The farmer groups operate with low technology adoption level and public extension service has not any field-level activity about ecological farming. The employing approaches in both AKISs are based on traditional models. The most important pillars of sustainable development such as participatory approaches and empowering the local were not recognized in the region.

AB  - Coastal hardening, via marine infrastructure construction (MIC), is contributing to the urbanisation of coastal environments, adding challenges for the resilience of marine ecosystems. Concrete is the preferred material for MIC due to desirable construction properties. Ecological-engineering efforts aim to increase the ecological value of concrete use in MIC via artificial material modifications, promoting ecological functions of MIC and creating new artificial marine habitats. Generally, ecological-engineering efforts include a wide array of stakeholders with variations for any singular project dependent on a myriad of environmental, resource and societal factors which affect the scale, scope and budget of projects. This can potentially lead to missing elements for obtaining an encompassing sustainability assessment of these types of projects on a societal, environmental and economic level. This perspective communication identifies and discusses experiences from recent ecological-engineering projects with concrete. Development of a collaborative, interdisciplinary framework will hope to guide current and future projects to achieve sustainability for ecological engineering practices for MIC.

AB  - This paper explores the potential implementation of Nature-Based Solutions (NBSs) in agriculture, specifically focusing on soil and water management in Southern Italy, particularly in the Apulia and Basilicata regions. Through a tailored questionnaire, it investigates farmers' perceptions of the utility of NBSs, addressing key issues in the region and evaluating their role in addressing soil and water management challenges. Findings reveal primary challenges such as drought, floods, and water pollution, with soil erosion being a major concern. Several NBSs, including wetlands and bioswales, demonstrate consistent utility and performance, while disparities exist for agroforestry and strip cropping. The study underscores a significant gap in the economic valuation of NBSs, emphasizing the need for comprehensive assessments that incorporate livability improvements, water quality enhancement, and socio-cultural benefits. Additionally, an analysis of NBS implementation across Italian agriculture reveals limited case studies, suggesting the need for strategic expansions to meet Sustainable Development Goals. This research offers critical insights into the effectiveness and challenges of NBSs in agricultural soil and water management, advocating for enhanced stakeholder engagement and the development of multidimensional evaluation frameworks to support sustainable practices.

AB  - This study explores the role of participation in achieving social sustainability in urban environments. As uncertainties about the future grow, the need for methods that ensure the representation of diverse stakeholders becomes essential. The Participatory A'WOT-TOPSIS Method is introduced as an effective approach for managing multi-actor and multi-decision-making processes. This Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) method combines SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) analysis with the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). An empirical application was conducted to assess various urban scenarios through a strategic planning process involving five distinct stakeholder groups. Using an inductive approach, one of three scenarios was selected. Findings demonstrate that the proposed method enhances transparency, ensures objectivity, reduces inconsistencies in stakeholder decision-making, and promotes collaborative representation. However, increasing the number of decision-makers and decisions may lead to greater workload and time demands for those implementing the method. This approach lays the groundwork for future research incorporating elements like representation, belonging, and identity into participatory processes to foster social sustainability in urban areas.

AB  - Food systems must become more sustainable and equitable, a transformation which requires the transdisciplinary co-production of knowledge. We present a framework of food sustainability that was co-created by academic and non-academic actors and comprises five dimensions: food security, right to food, environmental performance, poverty and inequality, and social-ecological resilience. For each dimension, an interdisciplinary research team-together with actors from different food systems-defined key indicators and empirically applied them to six case studies in Kenya and Bolivia. Food sustainability scores were analysed for the food systems as a whole, for the five dimensions, and for food system activities. We then identified the indicators with the greatest influence on sustainability scores. While all food systems displayed strengths and weaknesses, local and agroecological food systems scored comparatively highly across all dimensions. Agro-industrial food systems scored lowest in environmental performance and food security, while their resilience scores were medium to high. The lowest-scoring dimensions were right to food, poverty and inequality, with particularly low scores obtained for the indicators women's access to land and credit, agrobiodiversity, local food traditions, social protection, and remedies for violations of the right to food. This qualifies them as key levers for policy interventions towards food sustainability.

AB  - This paper reports on a research project aimed at investigating ways in which fashion activism and making can be used to catalyze positive socio-economic change and activate legacies within a local community. The project focused on a neighborhood in London with a previously strong industrial profile in fashion and textiles, and now challenged by concerns regarding deprived youth, skills shortage, decline in local manufacturing, and high unemployment rates. To tackle such challenges, this participatory action research project comprised a range of fashion activism interventions. The project was developed through a partnership between a Higher Education Institution and local government and contributed to activating change from within the system. The approach adopted is defined as "middle-up-down" as it bridges bottom-up initiatives activated by grassroots communities with top-down services delivered by support organizations. The outcomes of the project are discussed in relation to the key themes emerging from the project evaluation: sustainability awareness, empowerment and skills development, career pathways, and community engagement. In demonstrating how a "quiet" form of activism can be used as an embedded and situated approach to co-designing meaningful social innovations within the local community, the paper also outlines the limitations of the project and recommendations for future work.

AB  - Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a challenge that many public administrations face in promoting sustainable growth. Local governments, as the governmental tier closest to citizens, should deliberate upon strategies and actions attuned to achieving SDGs for the benefit of their communities. Through a comparative analysis of Italian and Spanish local governments, this research investigates the conditions that can support the achievement of SDGs. The results depict the political and financial levers that can stimulate politicians and policymakers in designing appropriate strategies and action plans towards the achievement of SDGs, while opening the path for further research that can support public administrations in their efforts at achieving sustainable growth. Points for practitioners Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are believed to play a vital role in our society. They represent the background of strategies and policies implemented at a local government level; accordingly, politicians and public managers are key actors in achieving SDGs. Our study shows that local governments tend to implement sustainable policies despite the political ideology; results also illustrate that governing in large coalitions could be a hindrance to implementing sustainable policies. Furthermore, favourable financial conditions support the achievement of SDGs.

TI  - Applying Concepts of Curriculum Design and Cultural Adaptation: Collaborating on a Dual-Degree Occupational Therapy Program in Mainland China
T2  - OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY INTERNATIONAL
LA  - English
KW  - PARTNERSHIPS
AB  - Occupational therapy is a profession with origins rooted in Western values. As culture plays an important role in shaping theory and practice, the curriculum design of academic programs that train future rehabilitation professionals should reflect the local context. As part of an international partnership, a dual-degree graduate program in occupational therapy was established between a Chinese and an American university. A team composed of members from both institutions collaborated on culturally adapting an entry-level master's program in occupational therapy for China, based on a U.S. program, which welcomed its first cohort in September 2019. This article details the timeline and process of program design and adaptation from conception, through implementation to evaluation and revision, with the aim of offering a framework for curriculum adaptation of other academic programs in the U.S. and internationally. The adapted curriculum includes the program mission, vision, and philosophy; the curriculum model with program outcomes and threads; the program scope and sequence; materials and resources; and course-specific objectives, learning activities, and assessments. The authors also share lessons learned through this experience of international collaboration as well as next steps for program evaluation and sustainability. The detailed overview of this international collaboration offers suggestions for individuals and institutions seeking to develop global partnerships and adapt curricula across cultural contexts.

AB  - This paper concludes a special feature of Sustainability Science that explores a broad range of social value theoretical traditions, such as religious studies, social psychology, indigenous knowledge, economics, sociology, and philosophy. We introduce a novel transdisciplinary conceptual framework that revolves around concepts of 'lenses' and 'tensions' to help navigate value diversity. First, we consider the notion of lenses: perspectives on value and valuation along diverse dimensions that describe what values focus on, how their sociality is envisioned, and what epistemic and procedural assumptions are made. We characterise fourteen of such dimensions. This provides a foundation for exploration of seven areas of tension, between: (1) the values of individuals vs collectives; (2) values as discrete and held vs embedded and constructed; (3) value as static or changeable; (4) valuation as descriptive vs normative and transformative; (5) social vs relational values; (6) different rationalities and their relation to value integration; (7) degrees of acknowledgment of the role of power in navigating value conflicts. In doing so, we embrace the 'mess' of diversity, yet also provide a framework to organise this mess and support and encourage active transdisciplinary collaboration. We identify key research areas where such collaborations can be harnessed for sustainability transformation. Here it is crucial to understand how certain social value lenses are privileged over others and build capacity in decision-making for understanding and drawing on multiple value, epistemic and procedural lenses.

AB  - The theory-driven approach to analysing and assessing collaborative performance provides an important tool for researchers and policy-makers seeking to understand collaborative performance. It explains performance deductively, in terms of the a priori causality of relationships between variables. Different theoretical domains provide different insights into collaborative performance. The theory-driven approach to collaborative performance contrasts with the metric-driven approach. Here, performance is defined in terms of what can be measured, and causality is then inferred inductively. Five performance domains are identified, covering the democratic, integrative, transformative, policy, and sustainability dimensions of collaboration. These draw on democratic theory, exchange and power-dependency theory, institutional theory, policy network theory, and discourse theory. The analytical consequences of each theory-driven approach are examined through three case studies. The article concludes that each theoretical perspective provides a distinctive insight into collaborative performance, thus more accurately reflecting its multifaceted mature than is possible with a metric-driven approach.

AB  - There is a growing demand in industry for engineering graduates who can think "sustainably." However, there are many barriers to developing assessment that fosters sustainability learning in engineering classrooms. There is no consensus on the definition of sustainability and its key competencies and teaching resources are limited.
   Staff are unclear about what to teach, how to teach, and how to assess learning. Assessment is an integral part of teaching and learning and should be planned from the earliest stages, but this is rarely done. Engineering relies heavily on traditional assessments such as tests and examinations, but these are known to encourage surface learning. Sustainability is complex, multidisciplinary, and needs context, which requires higher-order thinking characteristic of deep learning.
   Current assessment types for sustainability include examinations, case study, concept maps, and project-based learning. However, more research is needed to develop best practice assessments. Recommendations for teaching approach are to use a rigorous approach to instructional design, use a systems approach, and use a teaching model that promotes deep learning, incorporates context, and promotes alignment of learning objectives and assessment. Community-oriented assessments are recommended that feature the interdisciplinarity and complexity of sustainability and promote higher-order thinking.

AB  - While international agreements and legislation call for incorporation of four pillars of sustainability, the social (including cultural), economic and institutional aspects (the 'human dimension') have been relatively neglected to date. Three key impediments have been identified: a relative lack of explicit social, economic and institutional objectives; a general lack of process (frameworks, governance) for routine integration of all four pillars of sustainability; and a bias towards biological considerations. Practical integration requires a 'systems' approach with explicit consideration of strategic and operational aspects of management; multidisciplinary or transdisciplinary evaluations; practical objectives for the four pillars of sustainability; appropriate participation; and a governance system that is able to integrate these diverse considerations in management. We challenge all involved in fisheries to immediately take five practical steps toward integrating ecological, economic, social and institutional aspects: (1) Adopt the perspective of the fishery as a `system' with interacting natural, human and management elements; (2) Be aware of both strategic and operational aspects of fisheries assessment and management; (3) Articulate overarching objectives that incorporate all four pillars of sustainability; (4) Encourage appropriate (and diverse) disciplinary participation in all aspects of research, evaluation and management; and (5) Encourage development of (or emulate) participatory governance.

AB  - This article provides a case-based critical reflection on integrating transdisciplinary knowledge in entrepreneurship education as a framework for empowering future entrepreneurs and innovators . The increased complexity of modern societies emphasizes new requirements for teaching practices intended to equip decision-makers with the tools necessary for navigating poly-crises and contributing to the sustainability of coupled systems. This requires an interplay between inter- and transdisciplinary knowledge aimed at developing a common body of knowledge within a specific domain. Within our educational case study, we used a transdisciplinary approach to design and implement a curriculum for enhancing complexity literacy and systems thinking. . The specific learning outcomes can be categorized by referring to the qualification framework of knowledge-skills-competence that fosters an understanding of dynamic coupled systems . Our research shows the potential of transdisciplinary knowledge integration as part of a sustainable education for empowering future entrepreneurs and innovators. The analysis's results have implications for research and practice that incorporate such integration as part of transitioning to a new institutional framework at universities. Developing new, viable approaches to education has social implications that can be regarded as interventions targeted at achieving systemic impacts while enhancing the sustainability of education and society as a whole.

AB  - The leather industry of Bangladesh is facing considerable amounts of pressure to adopt sustainable supply chain management (SSCM). While there are some studies that have examined barriers to SSCM practices in developed and developing countries in various domains, these are not necessarily applicable to the Bangladeshi leather industry. To bridge this gap, it is crucial to identify most influential barriers to SSCM practices, particularly in the context of developing economies. Therefore, this study identifies such barriers and examines the causal relationships between them with an aim to facilitate the effective implementation of SSCM in the Bangladeshi leather processing industry. Thirty-five barriers to SSCM implementation were identified through a detailed literature review and a survey of leather processing industry experts. Among them, the most common 20 barriers were selected with the help of industry experts. Then, a blended, grey-based Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) approach was utilized to examine their interrelationships. The results demonstrate that nine barriers could be classified as causal and eleven as influenced. Lack of awareness of local customers in green products and lack of commitment from top management took high priority in the causal group. Lack of reverse logistics practices and Outdated machineries were the most influenced barriers. This research uses a leather processing company as a case study for demonstrating the proposed model. The findings aim to support the leather processing industry in a structural way, so that industrial managers can identify the most influential barriers and work to eliminate them. This study may be useful to stakeholders to achieve sustainable development. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In recent decades, there has been an increased emphasis on, and application of, collaborative and adaptive forms of environmental governance as a means to address complex social-ecological problems that cannot be achieved alone and support sustainable resource management. However, the majority of research in the collaborative governance and adaptability arena has relied on individual or small-n case studies. This has led to a multitude of definitions, indicators, and indices, which limits our ability to make inferences across cases and contexts. Relatedly, most research lacks formal tests of assumptions related to the dimensional structure and validity of constructs thought to represent collaborative dynamics and adaptability. There is a need for systematic and crosscase assessments situated within robust statistical frameworks to further our understanding of the forces and factors that cultivate collaborative governance and adaptability. We developed and administered a standardized survey assessment, grounded in the theory and practice of collaborative governance and adaptability, to fifteen collaborative projects funded under the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program (CFLRP) in the United States. We then used confirmatory factor analysis to test the dimensional structure, reliability, and validity of our theoretically and empirically grounded measures. Results indicate the components of collaborative governance and adaptability comprise six dimensions - principled engagement, shared motivation, leadership, resources, knowledge and learning, and institutional arrangements. As expected, several dimensions were significantly related, and the pattern of inter-factor relationships aligned with theoretical and empirical assumptions. We also found that the six dimensions represent statistically reliable, valid, and distinct measures that may be used to evaluate collaborative governance and adaptability. While our focus was on the CFLRP, the assessment can be adapted in other collaborative environmental governance contexts and used as a foundation for addressing key research gaps, including relating collaborative environmental governance processes to socialecological outcomes and collaborative adaptation and resilience through time. This is a critical line of work given the increased emphasis and reliance on long-term collaborative arrangements to achieve sustainability goals.

AB  - Sustainability is becoming essential and actively debated in the food sector, influencing companies and stakeholders globally. Sustainability practices have been developed and integrated into food industry actions and policies to meet present needs without compromising future needs. The aim of this study was to explore the current sustainability practices across the food industry in Europe and how initiatives are developed, implemented and evaluated to achieve food sustainability targets. This study formed part of a larger European project (2022-1-IE01-KA220-VET-000087508 Digitalisation of Sustainable Health Education). In-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with 21 food industry employees with expertise in sustainability across Ireland, Poland, Lithuania, and Cyprus. Interviews were transcribed and thematically analysed. Three themes were identified: sustainable practices challenges, facilitators of green practice, and thinking to the future, Complying with the Science-Based Targets initiative, and setting emissions targets such net zero by 2050 and reducing waste output, drove sustainable activities. Participants identified barriers to initiative development and implementation including cost, monitoring time, product quality, and employee engagement. Employee and stakeholder understanding were crucial to sustainability initiative success. Gaps in research were identified as the proliferation of environmental labels and greater company collaboration to share sustainability data. A key consideration highlighted in discussions was the importance of collaboration and education for raising awareness and strengthening the implementation and long-term maintenance of food sustainability practices within industry. Greater collaboration between large food companies to share raw sustainability metric data could strengthen initiative outcomes and raise greater awareness among stakeholders, bridging the knowledge gap with producers or stakeholders who operate on a smaller scale.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Encouraging resident participation in the Municipal Solid Waste Management system still becomes a challenge for cities in developing countries. Previous studies showed that existing education strategies ineffective and insufficient to change resident behavior sustainably. Therefore, this study aimed to develop a resident-based learning model to encourage sustainable resident participation in waste management programs at the household level using the Community of Practice approach.
   METHODS: This study was a conceptual model study using a case study as the research strategy. The case being analyzed was Kawasan Bebas Sampah (Zero Waste Area) program implemented in Bandung City, Indonesia. The primary data was collected through field observation on the 8 Kawasan bebas sampah and in-depth interviews with 63 key informants comprising 31 key actors in the educational programs and 32 informants as resident representatives, conducted from January 2020 - November 2020. Additional data from the quantitative method was gathered in April 2021, focusing on surveying resident's habits toward waste management as evidence of the program result.
   FINDINGS: The findings showed that the education strategy implemented in Bandung City, Indonesia presented effective results, based on waste reduction rate reaching up to 0, 47% at the city level from 2019 to 2020. The survey provided evidence that the education program has succeeded in forming new habits for residents. Averagely 60% of respondents in each sample area have the habits and up to > 90% for the areas with more durable education program. Some critical points for education strategy implementations are identified. First, collaboration and supports from key stakeholders such as facilitators, local leaders, and educators become the enabler of the program. Second, key stakeholders need to identify knowledge and value needs before the program started. Third, the learning activities are conditioned to facilitate practice-based and dialogue-based learning through group and non-group learning activities. Fourth, local cadres are vital to sustaining the education program.
   CONCLUSION: This study has succeeded in giving a new strategic approach to improve resident participation in municipal solid waste management. The resident-based learning model proposed in this study offered a more effective strategy for other cities in developing countries to improve the sustainable participation of residents in their waste management system. However, some adjustments may be required for residents with different characteristics. Future studies may focus on testing and refining the model to improve its applicability. (C) 2021 GJESM.

AB  - This study investigates the prioritization of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives from the perspective of stakeholders in Indian companies, aiming to align CSR strategies with stakeholder expectations. Using a fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) framework, we evaluate 30 sub-criteria across social, governance, and environmental dimensions. The findings reveal that social initiatives, particularly Employee Welfare and Health and Safety Programs, are prioritized highest by stakeholders, followed by governance initiatives like Regulatory Compliance and Ethical Business Practices. Environmental initiatives, although important, are ranked lower, with Pollution Reduction and Environmental Awareness Programs being the most significant sub-criteria within this category. The results underscore the critical importance of social and governance factors in shaping stakeholder perceptions and highlight their interconnectedness in achieving sustainable business practices. This research contributes to the existing literature by integrating stakeholder theory and the triple bottom line approach, offering a nuanced understanding of CSR priorities in the Indian context. It challenges the assumption that environmental initiatives are the most critical, showing instead that stakeholders value social and governance aspects more highly. These findings provide valuable insights for companies to refine their CSR disclosures, ensuring that their reports more accurately reflect stakeholder priorities and enhance transparency in areas that matter most to their audience.

AB  - The development of industrial and commercial activities in developing countries has increased the amount of waste generated by economic activities, which has generated environmental problems due to the complexity of waste management. Due to the economic, environmental, social, and sustainability implications, proper waste management has become a worldwide concern. In response to this problem, strategies have been implemented to develop clean energy, improve the efficiency of industrial resources, and recycle and reuse materials. As a result, the concept of industrial symbiosis (IS) has emerged as a strategy for waste utilization in a productive chain, based on physical exchanges of waste and materials, which finds ways to use the waste from one industry as inputs or raw materials for the other, all supported by business collaboration. This work aims to identify the opportunities and challenges that emerging and frontier countries have for waste utilization through the IS approach through a literature review. The needs that triggered the IS and how researchers materialized this approach to integrate the harnessing resources and materials in economic activities were identified. This paper identifies how emerging and frontier countries realize solid waste management through IS, and highlights opportunities for governments, researchers, and stakeholders to make effective decisions to achieve sustainable development, reduce environmental concerns and address current waste management issues. The literature review identified IS as an excellent way to dispose of and use the solid waste but also showed that emerging and frontier countries face many challenges in solid waste management due to the lack of policies focused on sustainability, lack of communication and trust among stakeholders, low use of technology in the industrial sector and technical barriers.

AB  - Real-world laboratories (RWL) aim to support transformations for sustainable urban development by producing outputs with practical and scientific relevance. To achieve these aims, the local community of which the RWL is a part should be in close collaboration from the start of a project. RWLs offer spaces for 'thinking outside the box' and for experimenting with new ideas through concrete interventions into the life world of the community. We provide methodological guidance for researchers on how to design interventions in RWLs that both affect change on the ground and contribute to scientific knowledge. This includes addressing issues important to local communities and generating transformation knowledge about how sustainable urban development can be actualised. We use the case of a project-based master's course within an RWL in the city of Zurich in Switzerland to demonstrate how the use of design thinking supported the development of needs-based interventions, curbing emissions from food consumption while aiming to generate scientifically relevant output. We conclude that further improvements in methodology are needed in order to test the effectiveness of interventions. However, the outputs of the approach show its potential both for having an impact in the real world and building on existing academic concepts for advancing transformation knowledge.

AB  - The Mediterranean region faces significant challenges within the Water-Energy-Food-Ecosystem (WEFE) Nexus due to water scarcity, increasing agricultural and energy demands, and ecosystem degradation exacerbated by climate change. This research addresses these challenges by integrating two water footprint (WF) methodologies, the volumetric Water Footprint Assessment (WFA) and the impact-oriented Water Scarcity Footprint (WSF) and then correlating the results with the WEF Nexus Index and other sustainability indicators, to explore trade-offs and synergies across water, energy, food, and ecosystem dimensions at multiple scales. Findings highlight that the most significant impacts of water consumption stem from the cultivation of water-intensive crops in water- scarce regions, both within and beyond the Mediterranean. This underscores the pivotal role of virtual water trade and the global implications of local water management practices. The results further reveal critical disparities in water resource use and stress among Mediterranean countries, emphasizing the need for targeted policy interventions and international cooperation to address these challenges. By elucidating the interdependencies between water and the other WEFE Nexus dimensions, this study contributes valuable insights for policymakers, researchers, and stakeholders striving to achieve sustainable resource management and resilience in the Mediterranean region and beyond.

AB  - The global increase in Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) is driven by international goals, like the Aichi Targets (2010) and the Kunming Global Biodiversity Framework (2023), which aim for 30% of land and sea to be protected by 2030. Despite these ambitious targets, experts agree that numerical goals alone are insufficient to address biodiversity loss and ensure ecosystem functionality. This has sparked significant research on the effective management of MPAs, highlighting the importance of biological, socio-economic, and managerial resilience. Various tools have been developed to support these aspects. However, even in areas with management plans, enforcement, and monitoring, stakeholder involvement in assessment processes is vital to equitable and sustainable management. Using G & ouml;kova MPA as a case study, this research evaluated its management over a three-year period by applying an assessment tool previously used by co-managing actors. Findings indicate that assessment results can vary depending on who conducts them, and structural challenges, such as coordination issues among governing bodies and overlapping authorities, further complicate management. These insights have been used to formulate recommendations for policymakers and conservation practitioners, emphasizing that reaching the "30 by 30" target requires not only increased area coverage but also improved management practices that incorporate stakeholder perspectives to achieve sustainable management of natural resources.

AB  - Soils must be understood from a transdisciplinary perspective, integrating biophysical, social, economic and political understandings. This requires new combinations of methods. This paper introduces the STEPS 'pathways approach', which emphasises the importance of 'framing' of different options. Through a case study from Ethiopia, the possibilities of a transdisciplinary analysis of soils are explored. This highlights the importance of investigating the spatial patterning of nutrients in farm landscapes, and the social processes that influence why soils have different levels of fertility, as well as how local dynamics are influenced by wider policy framings. A set of participatory methods, including farm mapping, landscape level transect walks and biographical analysis of people and places, is discussed. These help broaden out analysis and open up debate, exposing alternative pathways to sustainability.

AB  - Anthropogenically induced environmental changes, such as the persistent loss of biodiversity and decline in global forest stocks, require comprehensive, societal change towards sustainable behavior. Education is considered the key to empowering sustainable decision-making, cooperative participation, high levels of commitment, and motivation to support environmental protection. Holistic Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) approaches aim to foster eco-friendly behavior by combining knowledge acquisition with the promotion of affective drivers. The present study focuses on monitoring the individual interplay between ecological knowledge and environmental values. We compared learning outcomes within two environments: a nature-based, out-of-school setting at a local forest (study 1) and a classroom setting (study 2). Overall, 444 German 7th grade students participated in learner-centered activities on the topic of the forest ecosystem under anthropogenic influences. Following a quasi-experimental study design, we monitored pro-environmental and anthropogenic values (Preservation and Utilization) and knowledge at three test times: before (T1), directly after (T1) and six weeks after (T2) participation in the learning program. Students in both treatments acquired short- and long-term environmental knowledge regardless of the learning environment but in neither case did the learning activities intervene with individual environmental values. However, Preservation showed a positive correlation with the mean knowledge scores in both studies, while for Utilization, this relationship was reversed. A comparison of extreme groups revealed that, in both treatment groups, students with high pro-environmental values and low anthropogenic values showed a significantly better performance than their counterparts. Our findings highlight the importance of monitoring pro-environmental values when preparing educational modules for student groups independent from the learning environment.

AB  - Despite the growing knowledge about job satisfaction, the improvement of it for healthcare providers has remained a challenge. The present study was conducted to identify the challenges to nurses' job satisfaction and improving it by an action research approach. The present study was conducted from 2016 to 2018. The participants were twenty-four nurses, head nurses, and academic researchers as facilitators. They worked through two cycles of reflection and action for change for 19 months. The data were collected and analyzed using the concurrent mixed-method approach. The findings of the quantitative data revealed that the score of nurses' job satisfaction increased from 50.8 +/- 8.34 to 59.88 +/- 7.82 in pre and post measurements. Furthermore, reflection on actions in two cycles resulted in designing and implementing action plans for change, learning for both participants and facilitators, and improvement in nurses' satisfaction with the new program. Some of the Nurses' Job Satisfaction challenges can be decreased with their participation, they could establish the foundation of a sustainable job satisfaction program successfully. Also, implications introduced in this action research could be applicable for top managers and health system policymakers in a wider range of practice.

AB  - Forest social-ecological systems (FSESs) can play a major role in both the mitigation of climate change, as well as the adaptation of local communities to it. In Europe, however, forests are highly fragmented and located close to human populations. This means that maintaining forest sustainability implies not only increasing ecosystem adaptation but also developing social adaptation. Hence, there is a need to understand the current priorities and management goals of forestry stakeholders, as well as their capacity to achieve functional and sustainable FSES in the future. The present study uses an interdisciplinary approach to evaluate stakeholders' capacity to deal with climate change and top-down policies in different FSESs. We selected five FSESs in France that exhibit a range of climatic threats and socio-economic characteristics to estimate their adaptive capacity and transformative potential. The estimation is based on an assessment of different types of capital (i.e. natural, social, resources, governance) that involves evaluating 70 indicators through more than 70 semi-structured interviews with local stakeholders. Our results highlight that forest management in France, and more broadly in Europe, is mainly based on technical approaches, which build stakeholders' confidence in their capacity to maintain the status quo. We observe asymmetry in capital distribution in some FSES, mainly through the maximization of the resources capital, which can constraint FSESs in a robustness trap. To develop adaptive capacity for small perturbations as well as transformability, forestry stakeholders should be encouraged to compromises. More balanced capital distribution, with decreased economic benefits, along with new technical approaches and changes to the landscape composition could be necessary to ensure the long-term adaptability of FSES to climate change.

This paper shares the learning experiences of pre-service teacher students who took part in a participatory approach to educating for sustainable development in a South African IHE. A survey research design was used to collect the data from a large group (n = 376) of students over one semester. A qualitative research approach used the compulsory module's teaching and learning tasks as intervention. Narratives were completed in groups upon completion of the module. This research established that when including a participatory approach in teaching and learning in an education for sustainable development (ESD) module at a South African IHE social learning indicators (learning, critical thinking, problem solving and dealing with conflict) emerged and students used their different perspectives when reasoning to participate collaboratively to work toward resolving environmental issues. The significance of this paper is that social learning indicators have been identified in multidisciplinary pre-service teaching and learning in a developing country when using a participatory approach in a higher education ESD module.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic crisis is threatening our progressive social, ecological and economic development toward achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs). Studies of its impacts on sustainable development in emerging economies and on fast-growing regional development, such as Southeast Asia or the Association of Southeast Asia Nations (ASEAN), are scarce to date. This paper aims to investigate the COVID-19 impacts and identify challenges and opportunities for possible sustainable recovery solutions with respect to the UN SDGs. We employed a qualitative research method through analytical literature reviews and in-depth interviews with 33 organizations. Our results reveal various pandemic effects, challenges and opportunities for cooperative regional sustainability development and recovery strategies, such as intra-trade strategy, green economy and public-private-people partnerships. The findings provide practical guidance on policy implications for transformative regional sustainability and innovative recovery strategies to achieve the sustainable development agendas (i.e., ASEAN Community Vision 2025 and UN 2030 Agenda). Overall, the paper contributes to advance our limited understanding in this realm and benefits diverse stakeholders toward our sustainable futures.

AB  - The process of engaging with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and communities should be grounded within a human rights context, whereby it is the responsibility of those with agency and opportunity within universities and other institutions to recognize, support and action the rights of Indigenous peoples to be included and involved at the highest levels of education design and delivery. In keeping with an Indigenous human rights approach, this inclusion of Indigenous peoples in higher education design and delivery needs to occur via equitable, negotiated and culturally safe terms for all concerned. Further to this, facilitators and participants must understand and challenge the influence and impact of inappropriate, inaccurate, misleading and discriminatory notions about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander identity and authenticity that are generated in a myriad of forums outside of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander consent and control. The process of successful and sustainable engagement is facilitated by building meaningful interpersonal, inter-organizational and intercultural relationships beyond those that the Western university typically acknowledges or supports. Staff and students of the university will need to have a keen appreciation for the fundamental philosophies, values and customs of Indigenous peoples and groups they are engaging with, including the significance of relationships to kuntri and the importance of reciprocity and sustainable process. This chapter presents a personal reflection on these topics. I discuss the process and outcomes of designing and facilitating student engagement experiences with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander teachers and hosts since 1997. In doing so, I present some of my own key lessons and make suggestions that may help develop and improve other peoples' experiences in the future.

AB  - Sustainable innovations try to resolve complex challenges related to climate change. Co-creation with diverse stakeholders in innovation networks opens opportunities to successfully develop and implement sustainable innovations. However, collaboration between heterogeneous partners poses challenges at the level of stakeholder relationship management that affect the progress of innovation development. This study's purpose is to investigate how co-creation processes that develop sustainable and climate-neutral high-tech innovations in the greenhouse horticultural industry should be structured and how stakeholder relationship management affects the progress of innovation development. Design methodology is linked with innovation management literature. A case study observed seven innovation trajectories that developed energy saving and climate-neutral growing techniques in the greenhouse horticultural industry in Flanders (Belgium) and The Netherlands over a period of three years. In-depth interviews (n = 13) were conducted to have the partners reflect on the co-creation process. Results show that co-creation management should focus on team composition, partner alignment and transparent communication about intentions, expectations and role division throughout the process. The initial stages of a co-creation process are crucial for context mapping and creation of team cohesion and do affect the subsequent stages in the process. Besides, in sustainable high-tech contexts, co-creation facilitators are faced with the need for technical knowledge and skills.

AB  - There is growing support for the use of integrated assessments (IAs)/sustainability impact assessments (SlAs), at different government levels and geographic scales of policy-making and planning, both nationally and internationally. However, delivering good quality IAs/SlAs, in the near future, could be challenging. This paper mainly focuses upon one area of concern, differences between research and other technical contributions intended to strengthen assessment methodologies and the types of assessment methods considered usable by practitioners. To help in addressing this concern, the development of a common assessment framework is proposed, which is based on a shared, practitioner-researcher-stakeholder understanding of what constitutes a satisfactory integrated/sustainability impact assessment. The paper outlines a possible structure for this framework, which contains three interconnected elements-the planning context in which the assessment is to be carried out; the process by which the assessment is to be undertaken and its findings used; and the methods, technical and consultative, by which impacts are to be assessed. It concludes with suggested 'next steps', addressed to researchers, practitioners and other stakeholders, by which the assessment framework might be tested and improved, and its subsequent use supported.

AB  - Data generated from ocean observing, or ocean-atmosphere coupled observing, permeates every facet of ocean research, ocean sustainability efforts, and the blue economy and offers workforce opportunities for all education levels. The Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development and the Seabed 2030 effort will capitalize on the data availability and place a spotlight on the increased need for a workforce capable of analyzing and applying these data to generate solutions for sustainable ocean uses.
   Although most jobs will not require advanced degrees in engineering or science, the preparation of the 21st century ocean technology workforce demands an understanding of marine science and other disciplines, an ability to resolve complex environmental issues, and the ability to communicate complex ideas to a broad audience. Fostering these critical abilities will require a new set of learning opportunities. Developing and maintaining such a workforce will rely on innovative and flexible educational programs that break through the traditional "siloed" approach to education, while offering multiple and rapid pathways for degree and certification attainment.
   In response, we propose a program to prepare a workforce with the ability to utilize sensors, sensor platforms, sensor networks, crewed and uncrewed surface/underwater vehicles, sonar systems, and data processing capabilities.

AB  - Sustainable agricultural development is fundamental to food security and poverty alleviation, notably in developing countries. Many development initiatives focus on the enhancement of smallholder production and productivity because the majority of poor people in developing countries live in rural areas where agriculture is the main source of livelihood. The consequences of these development initiatives need to be assessed before implementation to reduce the risk of possible negative impacts. This can be done by applying ex ante sustainability impact assessment. Here, we compare methods of assessment of sustainability impact for farming interventions. We review methodological approaches and verify whether the requirements of sustainability impact assessment theory are fulfilled. Our major points are the following: (1) main methodological approaches do not fulfill the requirements defined in the theoretical sustainability impact assessment discourse. (2) The active involvement of different stakeholder groups throughout the assessment process and the possibility of learning and exchange are fundamental to sustainability impact assessment. (3) The institutional dimension of sustainability is not yet sufficiently integrated. We therefore suggest institutional criteria and indicators to be also considered in the sustainability impact assessment framework. We argue that sustainability impact assessment, respecting the interactive involvement of all stakeholder groups throughout the whole process, is a compulsory element in project planning for a sustainable agricultural development in developing countries.

AB  - This paper describes the resettlement process of a community devastated by annual floods, to newly constructed housing in Pune, India. The relocation from Kamgar Putala slum to a housing society at Hadapsar was organized by a community-led NGO partnership in 2004. The housing development was coordinated by the local NGO Shelter Associates with significant community participation. The housing has been revisited in 2010 to evaluate the sustainability of the resettlement project's delivery model via stakeholder perception. The process of organizing for resettlement after natural disaster is described along with the implementation and evaluation of the new housing nearly six years after initial occupation. The strong partnership approach overcame a series of political and financial hurdles at various stages of the relocation project. The story of resettling Kamgar Putala is detailed alongside an outline of the current political climate for an alternative slum-upgrading policy in India and Pune. The advantages of an empowered community supported by an influential local NGO demonstrate a commendable team effort which has tackled the threat of floods. The paper highlights the merits of a community- led partnership approach to housing development for achieving sustainable urban development as well as the alleviation of poverty in a developing context.

AB  - The imperative to measure progress towards Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) has resulted in a proliferation of targets and indicators fed by an ever-expanding set of observations. This proliferation undermines one principal purpose of the SDGs: to provide a framework for coordinated action across policy domains. Systems approaches to defining Essential Variables have focused monitoring of climate, biodiversity and oceans and offer opportunities to coordinate SDG monitoring. We propose four criteria and a process to identify Essential SDG Variables (ESDGVs), which will highlight interactions and gaps in current monitoring. The ESDGV criteria suggest a research agenda to: develop and test interdisciplinary system models; test transformations theory for sustainable development; analyse policy interactions; and formulate models to support further refinements of ESDGVs and SDG monitoring.

AB  - As multi-stakeholders are important in sustainable tourism development (STD), this study applies the social exchange theory (SET) to explain all stakeholders' perceptions towards STD's benefits and impacts on the local community. This paper is part of a larger study that offers better explanation of local leaders and policy-makers' perceptions towards STD as these stakeholders act as the critical initiators or facilitators in a selected tourism site in the local community. A total of ten local leaders and policymakers in Thailand was interviewed and the results were thematically analysed using Nvivo program. Although positive and negative perceptions are anticipated, other insightful results including fostering mutual benefits for all stakeholders in a sustainable way are presented. Sample size, data collection and research methodology are this paper's limitation. Further research should include more data from other stakeholders in order to understand the bigger picture of applying SET in STD.

AB  - In this essay, we offer a framework for a community development-focused, multilateral, sustainable justice-oriented service-learning and community engagement (SLCE); exploring what it is, why it is needed, how it looks different from other existing and emerging trends in SLCE, and how we believe it would transform the ways in which institutions of higher education (IHEs) think about and approach both community partnership-building and student learning in community contexts. To this end, we draw out the dimensions of a transformed practice of multilateral partnership and demonstrate how it would deeply challenge both foundational understandings and current models. Finally, we discuss how a transformed partnership framework would necessarily alter the way we conceptualize student learning - and the benefits of students' learning - in community contexts.

AB  - What kind of learning is required to bring us towards a more sustainable future? We argue that when behaviourally and technically complex issues intertwine, a collaborative social learning process that engages diverse actors in deep systems change is necessary. The learning required includes but overtakes debate, bringing organisations, individuals and communities into cycles of experiential, cumulative, ad hoc and opportunistic, yet systematic, learning. Current conceptualisations and approaches to learning have not been framed with the requisite level of integrated complexity given our sustainability challenges. This article introduces the action research approach of learning history in an open system' in the service of such learning. Updating the heretofore single-project focussed learning history, we present recent methodological developments for its use in open systems that support a joining up of projects and sites of endeavour to support deeper and accumulating systems' learning. We explore the links to learning literature drawing on developments in aesthetics and arts-based action research to suggest our approach is one useful way of responding to the more general challenge of scale that concerns action researchers.

AB  - This study attempts to examine how urban agglomerations establish sustainable environmental collaborative governance. To achieve this goal, the qualitative comparative analysis method is used to explore the conditions and models for urban agglomerations to establish environmental collaborative governance, with 12 urban agglomerations approved by the Chinese authorities as examples. Based on the collaborative governance framework, this paper proposes six starting conditions that affect the establishment of urban agglomeration collaboration: vertical intervention, horizontal cooperation, leadership attention, governance capacity, initial pollution, and economic governance. The interaction of these conditions was tested in the practice of environmental cooperation in urban agglomerations. The results show that horizontal cooperation, leadership attention, and economic governance are necessary conditions for the establishment of urban agglomeration cooperation. The authority-driven mode, capability-driven mode, and pressure-driven mode can promote cooperation. Vertical intervention, governance capacity, and initial pollution constitute the external and internal driving forces of urban agglomeration cooperation. These findings supplement the literature on urban agglomeration collaboration and provide policy makers with insight into sustainable urban agglomeration collaborative environmental governance.

KW  - COMMUNITY
AB  - This paper argues that transitional justice needs to adopt a participatory approach to achieve longer-term sustainability, shifting away from the top-down 'one-size-fits-all' approach to allow 'voices from below' to be heard and heeded. It critiques dominant interpretations of key transitional justice concepts, and links them to the difficulties of post-conflict transitional justice in a range of violently divided societies. Popular participation and local agency, it is argued, is necessary to achieve ends identified in much transitional justice discourse, and to embed mechanisms for the creation of sustainable peace. A Northern Ireland initiative (the Ardoyne Commemoration Project) will be explored in-depth, illustrating how a bottom-up 'truth-telling' process can make a significant contribution to transitional justice and casting doubt on the validity of the deference to legal dominance in current policy and practice. The paper recommends that knowledge available in development studies and participatory theory be applied more clearly in debates and approaches in transitional justice.

AB  - This scoping literature review examines critical success factors (CSFs) in the design and planning phases of BIM-enabled construction projects, focusing on integrating sustainability practices across the quadruple bottom line: profit, people, planet, and process. By introducing the novel 'Process' pillar, this study aims to bridge critical gaps in sustainability research, emphasising technology-driven practices and mapping 62 CSFs from 31 studies to specific stakeholder roles, and focuses on early project phases in which decisions have the most significant impact on long-term outcomes. The findings highlight how early-phase decisions, guided by the QBL framework, can optimise project outcomes and drive long-term sustainability through effective stakeholder engagement. Despite advancements, the design and planning phases of BIM-enabled construction projects consistently exhibit an underrepresentation of end users and environmental considerations. These omissions highlight inadequacies in stakeholder engagement, which are critical for achieving comprehensive sustainability and aligning project outcomes with user needs and environmental goals. This research maps CSFs to corresponding stakeholders, revealing a complex network with the BIM coordinator/manager playing a pivotal role. This mapping underscores the importance of integrating stakeholder inputs, particularly from end users, early in the project lifecycle to enhance functionality and ensure the long-term viability of construction projects. However, current practices often overlook this, leading to a potential misalignment between project deliverables and user expectations. The construction industry can move towards more sustainable, efficient, and user-focused outcomes by addressing these gaps. This study calls for a paradigm shift in BIM methodologies to adopt a construction environment that is not only efficient but also adaptable to the needs of its users and the environmental imperatives of today's world.

AB  - The distribution of decisional power and ability of local communities to participate in natural hazard risk governance (NHRG) are critical success factors for sustainable development. This article assesses the evolution of power distribution and participation at the local level in NHRG using bibliometric and international discourse analysis. The results show that participation-related concepts are underrepresented in NHRG, compared to environmental resource management and community & livelihood development fields of research. This implies the existence of societal/community barriers that impede the development of a sustainable paradigm in NHRG. In addition, when present, participation is mostly passive (non-decisional), a finding also observed in the representation of these concepts in the international discourse of United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (UNISDR). For sustainable NHRG, it is necessary to have explicit targets of authentic and long-term support for active community involvement with a planned share of power. This prescription is supported by unequivocal references in the recent (2010-2011) international discourse of UNISDR.

AB  - Rapid migration towards cities is occurring due to economic and social reasons. Industrialization, urbanization, and changes in consumption habits are creating environmental problems. Sustainable urban planning is necessary to ensure people's quality of life in future cities. The establishment of strategic waste management processes is crucial. This topic encompasses the awareness, education, adaptation, and implementation of them by urban residents. The "Zero Waste Project" was initiated in Turkiye in 2017, and local governments have a significant responsibility for its implementation. City administrations strive to create clean, healthy, contemporary, and livable environmental conditions for their stakeholders. The aim of this study was to examine the Zero Waste Project system, an important approach for planning sustainable cities. Istanbul has 39 district municipalities. In this study, the amount of waste collected by the municipalities affiliated with Istanbul within the scope of the "Zero Waste Project" in 2022 was determined. Data were obtained from the "Zero Waste Project Implementation" sections of the 2022 activity reports of the 39 district municipalities. Data on the quantities in the categories of packaging, glass, clothing and textiles, electronics, batteries, vegetable oil, pharmaceuticals, tires, motor oil, and wood waste were obtained. This help us understand, the implementation of waste management systems in Istanbul district municipalities. In addition, the "Zero Waste Awareness and Incentive" activities carried out in Istanbul district municipalities are emphasized. The Zero Waste Project has the potential to improve the sustainability of urban living. It can be evaluated as a participatory environmental policy in terms of sustainable urban planning.

AB  - The outbreak of COVID-19 confronted the international community with critical health, social, and economic challenges. Travel and tourism were among the hardest affected sectors. In 2020 and 2021 new travel trends emerged, emphasizing local destinations, short distances, and consequently, lower-carbon transportation (proximity tourism). Post-pandemic recovery represents an opportunity to bounce back better by rethinking the sector's economic model for the sake of sustainability and innovation. This paper disseminates the research that led to the structuring of guidelines for a breakthrough and inclusive municipal-level action plan for the promotion of sustainable tourism, as part of the Tourism Friendly Cities project. An operational methodology is discussed here, whereby key stakeholder participation, conceptualized through a sextuple helix model, is the foundation of the planning process. A small-scale action and a qualitative assessment tool of the participatory process are also illustrated. The proposed methodology corroborates the vast positive effects deriving from stakeholder participation in terms of trust, ownership, planning quality, innovativeness and sustainability of interventions. In applying the methodology, although the digital framework was evaluated positively in terms of the number of participants that could be involved, data collection, and confidentiality of activities, the evaluation shows that hybrid modes of participation are more desirable.

AB  - Sustainable development and the green building movement have been adopted faster than any recent movement in the engineering field. With over 40% of the total U. S. energy usage servicing the operation of commercial and residential buildings, this trend is well founded. Recent surveys of the industry indicate that within 4 to 5 years, a vast majority of engineering firms expect their business will be significantly dedicated to green building designs. In contrast, current academic institutions are not well positioned to prepare young engineers for this challenge, and current faculty are not well trained in the tenets of sustainability or the roles of engineers in this movement. Change must occur if the engineering and design professions are to remain relevant and responsive to societal needs. To accommodate this challenge, the writers have designed and implemented the Integrated Design Experience (IDeX), a capstone course in which undergraduate and graduate students interact with faculty and practitioners on real projects with challenging needs in sustainability. The course is designed to provide an actual and virtual space for the multitude of disciplines to interact on real designs to foster both improved research and outreach efforts. Expected outcomes from the course include both student and faculty learning on the methods and value of sustainable design as well as the development of an interdisciplinary network of faculty and practitioners involved in sustainable design. Learning is being evaluated using a continuous authentic assessment of design products. First-year results indicate that students learned interdisciplinary teamwork and communication skills, and they see substantial value in the authentic design experience. In future years, the development of the interdisciplinary network will be tracked by using social networking tools and by assessing faculty attitudes toward involvement in IDeX. Both metrics will be investigated using the diffusions of innovation framework. The combined evaluation will lead to an in-depth understanding of how the IDeX model can be scaled and replicated at other institutions. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)EI.1943-5541.0000058.

AB  - With the increasing demand for interior landscapes, sustainable interior landscape design (SILD) has become part of a desirable lifestyle. However, consumer attitudes and a lack of consciousness and understanding of SILD have led to potentially negative impacts on design decisions regarding the use of sustainability in SILD. This study recruited 405 stakeholders to explore the relationships among value cognition, risk attitude, and decision intention. The value-attitude-behavior (VAB) model method was adopted to evaluate stakeholders' cognitions and attitudes toward sustainable design and factors that influence sustainable design practices. The results demonstrated a positive correlation between multistakeholders' value cognition, risk attitude, and SILD decisions. The relationship between value cognition and SILD decision intention is mediated by risk attitude. Furthermore, the value cognition of multistakeholders impacts risk attitude on the practice of SILD, thus changing design decisions. These findings provide insights into the sustainability of interior landscapes and design, particularly in terms of addressing diverse needs within multistakeholder practices.

AB  - How can a participatory approach to research promote environmental learning and enhance social-ecological systems resilience? Participatory action research (PAR) is an approach to research that its' supporters claim can foster new knowledge, learning, and action to support positive social and environmental change through reorienting the standard process of knowledge production. PAR is posited as being particularly suitable for use with historically disadvantaged groups. As such it may be a useful tool for environmental learning which would enable a social-ecological system to better respond to change as theorized by resilience thinkers. In this paper, we examine a PAR project to determine how PAR fostered environmental learning and, in turn, how the learning influenced resilience. The project partnered an ecologist, federal and state forest managers, and harvesters of salal (Gaultheria shallon), a non-timber forest product gathered and sold for use in the floral industry in the forests of the Olympic Peninsula, Washington, USA. Based on interviews with each group of partners during and after the PAR project, we found that the PAR approach did indeed generate environmental learning, defined here as ecological literacy, civic literacy, values awareness, and self-efficacy, and contributed to resiliency through promoting greater diversity, memory, redundancy, and adaptive capacity. However, the political vulnerability of the salal harvesters, who were largely undocumented Latino workers, inhibited the extent to which adaptive measures could be taken to revise permitting procedures and additional collaborative research. We conclude that the PAR approach is a valuable tool for environmental learning but the extent to which learning can actually promote system change and greater resilience must also be understood within the underlying context, especially political realities.

AB  - This paper develops a framework for a generic retail stakeholder charter that addresses expectations of relevant retail business stakeholders to achieve success and sustainability. Hevner's design science research model was used for the development of this framework. Relevant literature on retail business management, stakeholder theory, and existing charters was reviewed and used for the design of a draft generic retail charter framework. The draft framework was submitted to expert practitioners and academics for verification in terms of correctness, completeness, and relevance to develop the final retail charter framework. The framework addresses stakeholder expectations regarding relevant categories, and the structure of the retail charter addresses the identity, elements, and the management of the retail charter. The elements in the generic retail charter are structured to achieve stakeholder support by ensuring compliance, satisfaction, and excitement. This generic retail charter framework creates research opportunities for the development of detailed retail charters for every stakeholder category, and customized retail charters for individual retail businesses. The framework provides further research opportunities for retail businesses operating in a particular industry, ecommerce, various Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes, and other countries.

AB  - Within the field of interdisciplinary sustainability science, the popular concept of change agents has been only vaguely theorised. In the current debate, neither sociological theories of practice nor the level of participation required for a transformation towards sustainability are considered. On the basis of a qualitative analysis of change agents in two districts of the city of Cologne, as well as Pierre Bourdieu's theory of practice, this paper aspires to provide a sociological substantiation of the concept of change agents. The availability of social and/or economic capital, time, and a mental disposition for change are identified as prerequisites for actors to evoke social change. More than half of the analysed change agents were directly or indirectly open to sustainability issues. Here, for urban sustainable development, lies a potential to integrate actors beyond the traditional sustainability community and build on local social networks.

AB  - Purpose
   This paper aims to examine how the dynamic interplay of governance mechanisms of the university-firm R&D alliance reduces obstacles and enables the successful commercialization of research collaboration output.
   Design/methodology/approach
   A longitudinal case research and retrospective strategy were used to collect relevant data and information in the four university-and-firm alliance teams collaborating on R&D projects in Thailand during 2008-2014. In-depth interviews and meetings were conducted with representatives of all partners and R&D project teams.
   Findings
   The authors found that formal and informal control mechanisms act as complementary forms of governance. The informal control (trust) serves as the frame of intentions whether the formal control is interpreted as a guideline or a commitment. Both formal and informal control mechanisms must be put in place to successfully and sustainably develop collaborative research into a commercial product.
   Research limitations/implications
   This study investigated four Thai government-funded research collaboration teams from a single industry. It would be worth investigating such research collaboration in other industries and those without any government funding.
   Originality/value
   This study applied an exploratory case research method which is rarely used in research on R&D alliance teams. It generates cross-functional insights on how to build trust in such R&D context, especially in an emerging economy.

TI  - DEVELOPMENT AND HEALTH IN THE PACIFIC - WHICH WAY TO DIE
T2  - PAPUA NEW GUINEA MEDICAL JOURNAL
LA  - English
AB  - Development in the Pacific has largely ignored the importance of health as a pathway and an outcome. This paper reviews the effects of development on health and health services in the region. It aims to highlight the plight of development that happens without considering the sociocultural and physical environments of the small island countries. The review shows that health and social conditions in the Pacific are deteriorating. The process of development has been externally controlled without community participation. Pacific leaders have been preoccupied with economic development and have not been cognisant of health and social consequences. During progress an enjoyable life can be achieved through sustainable development with community participation. However, indicators of economic growth in the Pacific do not correlate with those of health. The increase of rape, suicide, drug abuse, sexual promiscuity and crime suggests that Pacific islanders are increasingly disillusioned by the present developmental approach: they have ceased to enjoy life before death. it is suggested that decentralized development planning with community involvement, integrating health and social considerations, would be the way out of this dilemma.

AB  - The sustainability challenges tackled in environmental assessments (EA) call for transdisciplinary cooperation linking research and practice in a joint change agency. This article explores the researcher's agency through the development of an EA network that seeks to support collaboration between researchers and practitioners, mutual learning, and change with a view to sustainability. We are conducting a case study of 'The Environmental Assessment Day' (EA-Day), an annual Danish conference that has been held for 10 years and attracts representatives from public and private organisations relevant to EA. The article is centred around the questions: How and why has the EA-Day network developed, and with what value creation for individual participants and for the general Danish EA practice? A mixed-methods approach is utilised to garner insight into the role and effects of the transdisciplinary conference. The results show that EA-Day is characterised by many different organisations giving presentations and a strong network of participants. The results also reveal how EA-Day provides an important platform for mutual inspiration and the qualification of research and practice. The results are relevant for all actors interested in networks and conferences in the EA field, and especially those interested in how to promote collaboration between research and practice.

AB  - Evolving conceptions of the purposes of higher education suggest the need for assessment practices that contribute to preparing students to navigate complex social-ecological challenges. Though shifts in assessment discourse have begun to respond to this need, further examination of the role of students in assessment processes is required. One strategy that has been highlighted is rubric co-design, in which students and instructors interactively deliberate assessment criteria. However, the literature shows that student voices are typically limited in these processes. To address this gap, this study advances a student-led rubric co-design process to promote student agency and learning. Principles from sustainability are applied to orient the activities of students in this approach by emphasizing the participative, normative and integrative features of the process. A formative intervention was conducted in an undergraduate course focused on professional skill development. Data were collected through individual and group reflections, with reflexive thematic analysis applied to develop themes that represented the ways that students navigated their experiences in the assessment process. Findings demonstrate the promise of the approach in enhancing student agency and promoting self-formation as emerging professionals, while articulating the phases and strategies that shape students' leading role in rubric co-design processes.

AB  - In this paper, a review of Indigenous engagement in renewable energy projects is conducted and the main elements of energy partnerships between stakeholders and Indigenous partners are discussed. In recent years, Canada has witnessed more significant Indigenous involvement in economic and energy development projects than ever before. For large-scale energy partnerships, the focus is on engagement, financial capital, community buy-in (readiness, and entrepreneurial and business skills), and benefits-sharing with community partners. Equity-ownership, reconciliation, and self-determination intersect with and impact the benefits and sustainability of energy projects, as they are interrelated in the framework of most energy partnerships. This paper illustrates policy disconnects in connection with partnership-making, social outcomes, and decision-making among Indigenous communities. Furthermore, findings from relevant literature explore the nuanced discourse on social implications and capacity challenges that interlink with climate adaptation and reconciliation when promoting large-scale renewable energy partnerships with Indigenous communities. Through a systematic review and a meta-analysis of the literature, we found 80 relevant studies during the screening process, of which 33 were selected for the synthesis. Findings demonstrate that the Crown, energy companies, and community partners need to coordinate and collaborate closely to achieve energy security and sustainable renewable energy. The review suggests that Indigenous engagement in energy partnerships supports positive outcomes for social development and environmental protection among Indigenous communities. The literature suggests that when government and industry mentor in the project implementation process, important positive impacts on energy transitions, and self-sufficiency can be realized.

AB  - The electronic retailers face distinct challenges in information sharing compared to their purely offline counterparts, particularly in transparently communicating their environmental practices to increasingly conscious consumers. This complexity increases in e-retailing due to the absence of direct interaction makes it difficult for consumers to evaluate the sustainability efforts of retailing channel's stakeholders. In response to it, manufacturers and e-retailers are leveraging social media and blockchain technology personalized advertising to bridge this information transparency gap. This research presents a sustainable multi item integrated model for manufacturer-retailer collaboration in e-retailing by incorporating multiple delivery policies and investments in technology aimed at information disclosure and environmental footprint reduction. The manufacturer adopts a smart production system and reuse returned goods in the manufacturing process while investing in Green Emissions Reduction Technology. Meanwhile, the e-retailer enhances product demand through Information Disclosure Technology on social media and blockchain by showcasing their environmental protection efforts. By employing a hybrid analytic-metaheuristic approach, we determine optimal production and delivery policies to improve green consumer service under varying budgetary and spatial constraints. results demonstrate a 4.39% increase in online consumer demand through information sharing and a 3.86% improvement in profitability of the collaborative retailing system under single-setup multi-delivery policy confirms robustness of the proposed model. Scenario analysis further provides decision-makers with actionable insights by showcasing 8.44% increment in the system profit by converting traditional production into smart production system. Moreover, the sensitivity of the proposed model to balancing the technology investments among emission control and information disclosure efforts suggests keeping track of the efficiency parameters of these investment options before making technology budget allocations.

AB  - Across a wide range of disciplines, mounting evidence points to solutions for addressing the global biodiversity and climate crisis through sustainable land use development. Managing ecosystem services offers promising potential of combining environmental, economic, and social interests in this process. Achieving sustainability, however, requires collaboration across disciplines, or in short "cross-disciplinary" approaches. Multi-, inter- and transdisciplinary approaches are often used as synonyms, although they are defined by different levels of integrating results and perspectives. We highlight challenges and opportunities related to these cross-disciplinary approaches by using research on bird- and bat-mediated ecosystem services as a case - with a focus on sustainable agricultural development. Examples from transdisciplinary collaborations show how more integrative and inclusive approaches promote the implementation of basic and applied ecological research into land use practices. Realizing this opportunity requires strong partnerships between science, practice and policy, as well as integration of diverse skills and perspectives. If appropriately funded and guided, this effort is rewarded by improved data quality, more targeted concepts, as well as improvement implementation and impact of sustainability research and practice. We outline a stepwise approach for developing these processes and highlight case studies from bird and bat research to inspire cross-disciplinary approaches within and beyond ecology.

AB  - The students' engagement was deemed significant to research due to the changing study structures from course-based to student-centered and competence-based in sustainable science higher education. Still, its change and coping strategies is considered as somewhat unfamiliar learning environment. Research examined students' engagement to the learning approach of a flipped-classroom model for sustainable science course with the Revised Two-Factor Study Process Questionnaire (R-SPQ-2F). It assesses research proposals, which students are utilizing to learning, and engagement and individual abilities as well. The research was conducted with the students enrolled in the 'Atmospheric Pollution" course of the Environmental Science undergraduate program (n=64). The results obtained through the R-SPQ-2F showed the students' number reaching higher "deep approach" in their learning increased at the course end while it can be observed that the students' number marking "surface approach" below the mean value was slightly lower (pre- and post-test comparison). It can be concluded that students are employing more engagement in their works and enhancing their personal skills as well with the teaching methodology. Results obviously specified that the study structure change was a phase into correct emphasis to improve students' engagement in the flipped sustainable science education.

AB  - Transfer students (TSs) transitioning from community college (CC) to university have been found to experience adjustment challenges different from those experienced by direct entrants (DEs) admitted straight from high school, which in turn influences their approaches to learning. Learning can enhance the transition towards sustainability, and it is influenced by various factors. However, there have been limited studies examining the factors associated with TSs' and DEs' learning approaches. To fill this research gap, this current study used a cross-sectional survey with both TSs (n = 841) and DEs (n = 978) to identify the factors. Our results indicated that the TSs had a higher rate of adoption of surface approaches (SA) to learning than DEs, while TSs and DEs shared some similar predictors of their learning approaches. The results suggest that the commitment of education stakeholders is essential for sustainable learning. They should improve the transfer system by providing adequate support and reduce disparities in the allocation of resources to TSs and DEs, as these affect learning approaches.

AB  - Strengthening the research-policy interface is dependent on conducting good research, as well as the appropriateness and applicability of identified policy options. The involvement of relevant stakeholders in collaborative research efforts to co-produce knowledge and recommendations to advance policies is one approach that can arguably improve this interface. This paper provides a practical instance of a research process on education for sustainable development (ESD) to develop a monitoring and evaluation (M&E) framework, which was conducted in the Asia region with participants from seven countries. This research process is presented as a pragmatic case study of how a collaborative research partnership was facilitated, and it examines how the interaction between researchers, policymakers and practitioners can be structured to support mutual learning in the field of sustainability education. The paper examines the wider debates regarding the research-policy interface, and it identifies the learning features that were achieved in this collaborative partnership, as well as the benefits this had for the research and knowledge co-generation. The paper concludes with a discussion of the challenges and issues M&E raises about the relationship between research and policy in ESD and suggests ways to address them.

AB  - The rapid urbanization and population growth in major cities have given rise to enduring urban challenges, prompting local governments to assess urban development performance and customize urban planning strategies to meet these challenges. This study aims to formulate an evaluation framework for the comprehensive efficiency of major cities, centering on governance, Information and Communication Technology (ICT), and sustainability as fundamental aspects. Distinct from prior research, the framework employs the network slack-based measure (SBM) to unravel efficiency, concurrently scrutinizing input/output slack and link efficiency. Utilizing the network SBM model, the study assesses the comprehensive operational efficiencies of 38 major Chinese cities spanning from 2015 to 2019. The application of the Kruskal-Wallis test discerns differences in comprehensive efficiency between coastal and inland areas. The results indicate that governance, ICT, and sustainability significantly influence the comprehensive operations of cities. In addition to general and short-term policies, the implementation of the National New-Type Urbanization Plan by the Chinese central government has led to an increase in the number of cities demonstrating sustainable efficiency. Despite fluctuations in the efficiency gap during the study period, coastal cities consistently outperform their inland counterparts in terms of efficiency. Persistent geographical disparities underscore the imperative for balanced development. While acknowledging positive strides in sustainable urbanization, the study emphasizes the ongoing necessity to address the adverse impacts of urban development, positioning governance, ICT, and sustainability as indispensable elements in confronting the multifaceted challenges inherent in urban development. The research findings contribute significantly to the field of urban efficiency evaluation, accentuating the collaborative impact of governance, ICT, and sustainability.

AB  - One of the main sustainable development goals (SDGs) of the United Nations (UN) is to teach people how to live in a sustainable way. Because of this, skill-based education is becoming more popular and is an important part of educational and social growth. Learning Factory (LF) provides gateways to skilled-based education. Therefore, the goal of this paper is to investigate the significance of the LF in academic institutions for educational and sustainable development. A multi-method research approach was used, including a literature review and bibliometric analysis, together with an overview of experts' opinions. Furthermore, a case study of the success of LF has also been included to support the phenomenon of interest and determine the feasibility of LFs. Developing a trained future workforce for inclusive sustainable development is a requirement for modern higher education in order to achieve sustainable development goals. Furthermore, collaboration between academia and industry is required to train a future workforce for inclusive sustainable development and to achieve sustainable development goals. The study provides unique practices and experiences for educational and sustainable development. Furthermore, it insists on universities being more open to deep and local knowledge collaborations.

AB  - Many in the conservation sphere have noted that robust and gender-equitable stakeholder engagement is crucial in achieving conservation outcomes, ensuring project sustainability and supporting human well-being. However, despite policies, international agreements and increasing requirements of donors, gender is still often viewed as an add-on rather than as a fundamental element of effective conservation. In an effort to overcome this, Conservation International has invested in nearly 20 project sites since 2014 to support targeted gender integration into existing conservation projects. We conducted a survey with practitioners across these sites to examine the barriers to and enablers of gender integration, and practitioners' perceptions of the benefits and challenges involved in this. Our findings demonstrate the importance of both external drivers (funding requirements) and a supportive environment (capacity building, technical and financial support) in incentivising a focus on gender. Respondents also reported a suite of benefits (e.g. increased participation, higher quality of the project) and costs (mainly financial) related to gender integration. In documenting these efforts to build gender-related capacity, and the associated benefits and challenges, we highlight the importance of gender-responsive conservation initiatives, and evaluate a method of achieving this. As conservation practitioners may be more inclined to listen to each other (given their shared objectives) rather than to gender specialists, this research can help to shift practitioner dialogue and conservation practice to be more open and responsive to gender.

AB  - How can a transdisciplinary approach in sustainability research on the global South transcend armchair scientific knowledge products and lead to meaningful collaborations, knowledge exchange and community engagement? When can transdisciplinary research yield more transformative and hands-on sustainable solutions within culturally and institutionally complex conservation landscapes? In this article, we discuss the results of a transdisciplinary (TD) knowledge to action (K2A) project on inland fishing experimentation in a remote, climate vulnerable island village of the Indian Sundarbans - laying out the context, the process, and the product of the 'transformative' enterprise, and its potential role in activating three converging SDGs (Goal 2: Zero Hunger, Goal 5: Gender Equality, and Goal 13: Climate Action) in the study area. The findings from this transdisciplinary research project strongly demonstrate that accomplishment of SDGs could be a locally-driven, bottom-up process, generating long-term and viable impacts for climate-affected ecosystems. The outcomes highlight that to ensure human wellbeing and upgradation of livelihoods in disaster affected areas, the very mandate of the SDGs-strategies and knowledge systems need to be pragmatic and place-based, aligning local community needs with the activation of SDGs within specific geographies and cultural contexts. The article is relevant in terms of establishing the interlinkage between TD research and SDGs on one hand, and exemplifying the efficacy of small-scale, locally rooted grounded actions in weaving narratives of hopeful transformations for densely populated climate vulnerable landscapes on the other.

AB  - Sustainable development and successful urban regeneration ideally require engagement with the affected communities. Existing methods employed by policymakers and planners often fail to reach significant segments of communities, the so-called 'hard-to-reach'. This paper describes the development of an innovative participatory GIS methodology specifically aimed at overcoming the barriers to engagement experienced by these groups. The application of the method is illustrated with reference to three recent case studies carried out in UK cities. The paper will then discuss the novelty of this approach in comparison with other participatory engagement techniques. The ethical implications of the technique are also discussed.

AB  - Despite attention to sustainability growing in the last decade in the wine sector, the rate of association with wine sustainability programs still appears to be limited. This is mainly related to the uncertainty about the economic benefits related to the implementation of sustainable best practices. In this regard, some studies highlighted that the presence of professionals capable of managing the requirements promoted by the standards generally leads to a positive perception of their impact on the economic performances of companies. Therefore, to encourage participation in sustainability programs, the adoption of a collaborative approach to share the skills and knowledge necessary to manage the transition from a conventional organization to a sustainable one seems to be a functional strategy. This paper presents the Prosecco Sustainability Project as a case study to investigate how a structured set of activities must be deployed through a participatory/collaborative approach to significantly improve the level of sustainability of a wide and heterogeneous community of grape and wine producers. The case study highlights that the collaboration between different actors and the guidance from a coordinating figure capable of fostering dialogue and cooperation among the various stakeholders represent key elements to the large-scale deployment of a sustainable management system.

AB  - Post-war Residential Re-construction Projects (PRRP) are widely complex and have significant risks. It is necessary to address sustainability risks in PRRP in order to respond to the war disastrous consequences. Thus, reducing sustainability risks associated with PRRP Life Cycle (LC) phases is of absolute importance for each stakeholder to achieve sustainability within PRRP process and performance. How to effectively get different participants to manage risks in the context of PRRP LC is decisive to the project sustainability objectives. This study aims to identify how sustainability risk factors change during PRRP LC phases and how LC Sustainability Risk Management (LCSRM) is perceived by PRRP primary stakeholders. Data were collected through survey and interviews with different stakeholder groups in Damascus PRRP. The findings revealed the top five risks of: 'Poor constructability' (with a score of 0.44 at the construction phase), 'Delays due to poor contract management' (with a score of 0.44 at the pre-construction phase), 'Lack of availability of green materials and equipment' (with a score of 0.43 at the construction phase), 'Pollution' (with a score of 0.4 at the construction phase) and 'Being fined for failing to meet the project objectives' (with a score of 0.36 at the construction phase). The majority of risk responses were found to be more effective in the planning, design, pre-construction and construction stages. LCSRM is presented in a participatory manner involving key stakeholders. Practical recommendations for developer, consultants, designers, contractors, project managers and regulators were presented. The study's LCSRM approach offers stakeholders a novel approach to customize their own list of sustainability risks. The main benefit of LCSRM is in shifting construction management control from input oriented to a more output oriented one in order to respond to unforeseen risks encompassing PRRP performance, which often deviated PRRP sustainability objectives from reality.

AB  - We explore the role of community-based conservation (CBC) in the sustainable management of conservation conflicts by examining the experiences of conservation practitioners trying to address conflicts between snow leopard conservation and pastoralism in Asian mountains. Practitioner experiences are examined through the lens of the PARTNERS principles for CBC (Presence, Aptness, Respect, Transparency, Negotiation, Empathy, Responsiveness, and Strategic Support) that represent an inclusive conservation framework for effective and ethical engagement with local communities. Case studies from India, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, and Pakistan show that resilient relationships arising from respectful engagement and negotiation with local communities can provide a strong platform for robust conflict management. We highlight the heuristic value of documenting practitioner experiences in on-the-ground conflict management and community-based conservation efforts.

AB  - This present study aims to elaborate on the use of the problem-based method as an instructional strategy to produce an engaging online program that can facilitate the student's learning achievement. Since the students must interact actively with lecturers, other students, and course content, it is necessary that online learning involves the use of proper instructional strategies. Contextual practice and learning feedback must be applied to facilitate students' learning process. This study applied a research and development model of Borg and Gall that adopts the systematic design of instruction of Dick et al. Descriptive and explanatory study designs were used in this research. The study applied a quantitative research methodology by using primary data and a formative evaluation as its instrument. The online learning course on academic writing was designed and developed by implementing the problem-based method as an instructional strategy. The study involved three systematic and systemic phases of research and development that include: the design phase, development phase, and evaluation phase. This present study involved a subject matter expert, an instructional designer, and a computer programmer. Besides, 36 online learning students participated as respondents in the study. A formative evaluation process was employed to try out and revise the program to ensure that the developed program was used by the intended target audience effectively. Online learning using a problem-based method was found to significantly enhance students' collaborative skills and cognitive competence.

AB  - Transdisciplinary sustainability training is a recognized need in many graduate programs. However, there is limited analysis of specific pedagogical tools to support this effort, particularly from the perspective of graduate students. Here, we reflect on the application of a "theory of change" process to support transdisciplinary thinking among early career researchers with diverse disciplinary backgrounds. For class participants, the theory of change process helped to clarify the diversity of actors associated with their research, to unpack their assumptions about complex problems, to clarify important causal linkages, and to support the development of a systems perspective. Challenges in using the theory of change in the classroom context included the difficulty of putting boundaries around student projects, and the additional time requirements involved in completing a detailed theory of change. The process helped class participants situate their specific and more disciplinary research projects in a broader sustainability context.

AB  - A transdisciplinary research approach requires that different scientists with their discipline-specific theories, concepts and methods find ways to work together with other societal players to address a real-life problem. In this study, the push-pull technology (PPT) was used as a boundary object to enable interactions among stakeholders across science-practice boundaries engaged in the control of stemborer pest in maize crops in Bako Tibe, Jimma Arjo and YayuWoredas in Ethiopia between August 2014 and April 2015. The PPT is a biological mechanism developed by researchers for the control of stemborer pests and Striga weed in maize crop. It involves inter-cropping maize with a stemborer moth-repellent silverleaf or greenleaf Desmodium (push), and planting an attractive trap crop, Napier or Brachiaria grass (pull), around it. The on-farm implementation of PPT was used to provide an opportunity for collaboration, interaction and learning among stakeholders including researchers from the Ethiopian Institute of Agricultural Research and practitioners from the Ministry of Agriculture and smallholder farmers/traders. The research was implemented following the transdisciplinary action research and the data collected using mixed methods approach, including key informant interviews, focus group discussions, workshops, on-farm practical demonstrations and participant observations. The findings show that collaborative leadership provides a chance for the stakeholders to participate in the technology learning and decision making, by enabling them to jointly contribute skills towards development, refinement and adaptation of the PPT. In situations where there are conflicts, they are embraced and converted to opportunities for in-depth learning, finding solutions and adaptation of the innovation processes rather than being sources of contradictions or misunderstandings. The leadership roles of the farmers enabled them to reflect on their own practices and draw on scientific explanations from researchers. It also enabled them to take the lead in new technology implementation and information sharing with fellow farmers and other stakeholders in a free and easy manner. Although the perennial nature of the companion crops in the PPT provides opportunities for continuous stakeholder interaction and learning, it requires a personally committed leadership and formal institutional engagements for the sustainability of the activities, which span several cropping seasons. Market forces and the involvement of the private sector also play a role as shown from the involvement of individual farmers and traders in Desmodium and Brachiaria seed production, collection and distribution during the PPT implementation.

AB  - The implementation and ongoing adoption of agricultural sustainability tools are challenging and not well addressed in the literature on sustainability assessment. Co-production of sustainability assessment and reporting systems between researchers and stakeholders has been promoted to increase the successful adoption of sustainability tools. Scientific attention has focused primarily on the development of sustainability assessment tools and has given less attention to the factors that encourage or discourage adoption and implementation. This paper provides ex-post reflections of the critical success factors, barriers, and lessons learned from the development of nine sustainability tools by the New Zealand Sustainability Dashboard Project (NZSDP) over six years of research and across multiple case studies. While the literature suggests that stakeholder participation and tool functionality are critical determinants for the successful adoption of a sustainability tool, this paper finds that neither factor adequately predicted the adoption of a tool. Instead, adoption was found to depend on a range of more nuanced concerns such as managerial support, end-user capability, and the specificity of the tool's functions. In order to ensure that practical outcomes are achieved through sustainability assessment, more attention needs to be given to the factors that enhance or impede sustainability tool adoption.

TI  - Fostering bottom-up actor coalitions for transforming complex rural territorial pathways
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY
LA  - English
AB  - This contribution presents the perspective on rural transformations to sustainability of the TRUEPATH action-research project in the agrarian frontier in Nicaragua. We start from a 'territorial pathways' framework, assembled from diverse theoretical building blocks and empirically grounded in experiences with local development interventions. This framework holds that incumbent and transformative pathways emerge out of the power-laden interactions of the biophysical territory with dominant, respectively innovative configurations of ideas, social structures and 'rules-in-use'. We emphasize the centrality and political nature of the on-going territorial processes and acknowledge that uncertainty and epistemological plurality are inevitable characteristics of any change process, implying the impossibility to define any particular objective end-point of 'sustainability'. This has methodological consequences for our potential contributions to transformative change. We reflect upon the ambiguous role of actors (including ourselves) involved in action-research processes and position our expected contributions to transformative change vis-a-vis potentially transformative actor coalitions.

AB  - In the context of Germany's coal phase-out, substantial resources are allocated to transform coal regions economically and socially. This study examines the opportunities and aspirations of young people in shaping local spaces, focusing on four participatory processes in Lusatia, eastern Germany. Utilising document analysis and 17 interviews with youth service workers, participants, and politicians, the study combines Massey, Doreen. 2005. For Space. London: Sage concept of space with Cahill, Helen, and Babak Dadvand. 2018. "Re-conceptualising Youth Participation: A Framework to Inform Action." Children and Youth Services Review 95:243-253 model for youth participation. It bridges the gap between young people's goals and motivations and the quality of participation formats, with a regional focus. Findings reveal that young people's aspirations align with adult-developed projects in transport, digital and business infrastructure, energy transition, and technology, but youth advocate for a more ambitious ecological transformation, digital solutions, and democratic decision-making. Despite well-designed participatory programmes demonstrating youth ability to contribute to transformation, their ideas are often publicly praised but rarely integrated into political decisions due to inadequate procedures. Some formats allowed youth to reposition themselves, highlighting the fluidity of power. The study calls for further research on youth participation from a spatial perspective, and emphasizes the need to better prepareyoung participants and policymakers to manage expectations and responsibilities in participatory processes.

AB  - The global consumer market demands personalized products and it is quite challenging for the manufacturing industry to address the consumer requirements along with optimal production. In order to curb customization and production challenges, emerging industrial technologies (EIT) are adopted by the industries such as artificial intelligence (AI), internet of things (IoT), autonomous robots (AuR), and mobile technologies (MT). However, this technological transformation may impact organizational sustainability due to EIT's higher capital investment, lack of skilled personnel to operate EIT, and EIT dependency on extensive energy consumption. In addition, EIT must resonate with the sustainable ways of production and consumption which again brings in another challenge of balancing sustainability and production. Ambidextrous practices may enable industrial stakeholders to explore and exploit this disparity. Therefore, it is required to explore the impact of EIT on organizational sustainability along with the mediation of ambidextrous practices which is a notable gap in the existing literature. The sample is taken from Pakistani textile industry to estimate the relationship between the research variables while a quantitative survey approach was adopted to collect data from textile industry professionals. The collected data from 192 respondents was analyzed using partial least square structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) method in SmartPLS 4. The findings reveal a differential influence of EIT on the organizational sustainability dimensions, significant impact in the case of AI, complementary mediation of OA with AuR, competitive mediation of Organizational Ambidexterity for IoT, and fully mediated by Organizational Ambidexterity for MT. The study enriches the dynamic capabilities framework, highlighting Organizational Ambidexterity as essential for effective technological integration to achieve sustainability. For practitioners and policymakers, this research offers a strategic roadmap for leveraging EIT aligned with organizational sustainability objectives, advocating for the development of ambidextrous capabilities to navigate implementation hurdles effectively.

AB  - Sustainability in water and sanitation, understood as the durability of services with a set of agreed characteristics over time, is a major challenge, particularly in rural areas of Sub-Saharan Africa. This fundamental issue must be addressed if the Sustainable Development Goals for universal access to water and sanitation are to be achieved. Major international organizations and Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) need to work alongside governments to improve sustainability. This paper describes the framework for sustainability programming developed by UNICEF, which is based on a collaborative and iterative learning and adaptive approach, underpinned by regular sustainability spot checks that inform a wider national sustainability agreement. The paper details the results of application of this framework in eight West African countries over the period 2013-2015. Results show the usefulness of the framework in identifying sustainability challenges and acting upon them. However, the continuous adaptation of programs is challenging for governments and international organizations. At the same time, structural aspects that threaten sustainability (e.g., lack of capacity) cannot be addressed in the short term. Further cycles of application of the framework will continue to provide evidence on the successes and limitations of the approach and inform its evolution into a stable country led-framework.

AB  - There are opportunities to improve livestock family farms (LFFs) sustainability in Uruguay by using the co-innovation approach to change management practices and incorporate technologies. To harness these opportunities, between 2012 and 2015, a research project was implemented in Eastern Uruguay, where three simultaneous processes occurred at three levels: farm, region, and research team. At farm level, the work was carried out in seven LFF as case studies following three steps: (i) characterization and diagnosis; (ii) redesign; and (iii) implementation, monitoring, and evaluation. At the regional level, a participatory approach to planning, monitoring, and evaluating the project's progress with regional stakeholders was adopted. At the team level, a Participatory Action Research approach was used. Consensus on the objectives and methods allowed for combined knowledge to solve practice-oriented problems. The 3-year project demonstrated the effectiveness in improving LFF sustainability, opened a learning space with stakeholders, and utilized a co-innovation model to improve rural development outcomes.

AB  - Service-learning has, arguably, gained significant currency as a pedagogical and engagement mechanism within the broader discourse of universities and their role in community development. However, less emphasis has been placed on the human development dimensions of service-learning for community members, with the focus largely being on students' experiential learning and other academic outcomes for the university. Though usually conceived as an integral part in university-community partnerships, community members' role in the conception and implementation of service-learning initiatives is from a peripheral position. In this paper, we interrogate this lacuna by applying core tenets of the human development approach to document the experiences and perceptions of community members within a university-community service learning partnerships. From the analysis of qualitative data n = 22, we demonstrate that while service-learning enhances agency, it continues to operate within a historical context and contemporary political economy of South Africa, which obscure community members' active participation and empowerment towards inclusive and sustainable valued outcomes.

AB  - The need for social-ecological systems to become more adaptive is widely acknowledged. Social effects generated by participatory planning have been claimed to contribute to this transformation, but little empirical evidence is available that backs up or opposes this notion. We aimed to offer some insights regarding questions as to which social effects are formed in participatory planning processes and at what costs, and to then discuss their contribution to the transformation toward more adaptive social-ecological systems based on empirical evidence. Consequently, we investigated the social effects of participatory planning processes, including the social learning processes leading to them. We conducted semistructured interviews with members of advisory groups involved in river engineering projects in Switzerland. Our results indicate that participatory planning processes can somewhat contribute to maintaining and spreading knowledge and social capital among individuals in a planning group, and this may help them collectively deal with new and complex challenges. However, it is costly in terms of time and patience to build up ecological knowledge, communicative capacities, and trust, with the latter also eroding over time. Overall, we conclude that the contribution of participatory planning via positive social outcomes to the transformation toward adaptive capacity social-ecological systems is smaller than optimists might hope. However, other forms of planning very likely result in no social effects or even the destruction of social capital. Participatory planning, in contrast, can offer the conditions for relational and cognitive learning contributing to the maintenance of social and political capital. Based on our results, we suggest shifting resources from technical to communicative aspects of planning processes and implementations. We recommend that project leaders provide stakeholders with firsthand information about projects, explain rationales and data behind decisions, and clearly communicate that stakeholders do not have decision making competence to support participants in finding their roles in similar participatory planning settings.

AB  - Objektives Using qualitative-hermeneutical methods with a focus on biographical (risk-) constellations for conditions of success or failure of return to work - and therefore on the efficiency and sustainability of employment participation benefits - the study accompanies participants during a time span of 2 years after their vocational retraining on their way back into the first labor market. Methods The study applies a mixed method design which combines 30 episodical-narrative interviews of participating rehabilitants alongside with a questionnaire survey of a total of 214 participants and 19 interviews of scientists and vocational retraining experts. Results Overall approximately 80% of the participants of our sample successfully return to work within a period of 18 months. Significant barriers can be illustrated by characteristic risk constellations, which correspond to the following dimensions: occupational choice, coping with illness, the need for protective area beyond the rehabilitation scheme, lack of (typical) life course orientation, lack of acceptance of a transitional phase with lower salary, regional occupation-specific labor market as well as social inclusion and support. Conclusion Qualitative-hermeneutical methods generate - apart from diagnostic attributions and theoretical hypotheses - new factors effective for return to work with importance for rehabilitants; these factors refer to their embeddedness in processes, interrelations and interactions between biography, context factors, and administrative routines. The results identify specific needs for post-rehabilitation services supporting persons with risk constellations.

The study also reveals that optimal utilization of resources, reduction of landfills, conservation of energy and incorporated advanced technology impacts most of the factors but get affected by a few factors.Practical implicationsIndustry practitioners and policymakers should consider the remanufacturing process to achieve sustainable and economic development. The government and other stakeholders can use the ISM framework and cause-and-effect diagram to classify the impact factors and their impact on the Indian economy and environment.Social implicationsThis study supports the process to save the landfills and curbing pollution, conserve energy and optimize utilization of the resources, generate employment and supporting the development of the economy. Remanufacturing will undoubtedly contribute to the development of an environment and economy in India that benefits both.Originality/valueISM and DEMATELs strategy offers a tiered model and a cause-and-effect relationship between the variables affecting remanufacturing in India.

AB  - A historical analysis is undertaken of the morphological transformation and present form of a 'village in the city' in Guangzhou. The traditional layout was produced mostly by the clan authorities and provided a basic framework fir subsequent development. During the process of rapid urbanization formal and informal alliances between new key stakeholders were established, greatly influencing the spatial restructuring of the village. A critical evaluation of current planning practices highlights the conflicts of interest between different stakeholders. It is concluded that integration of the activities of various key stakeholders is probably necessary in order to achieve more sustainable redevelopment.

AB  - Science-Based Targets (SBTs) are being developed for companies to contribute to global sustainability goals, including for 'nature'. The literature has not yet explored multiple understandings of SBTs. We adopt an interpretive approach, using Q methodology to explore framings of SBTs amongst 22 scientists and practitioners engaged in SBT development. Results show two distinct framings: 'we need science-based targets to help economic systems move towards global sustainability' and 'the system itself is unsustainable and needs to change - science-based targets can help', with areas of agreement and disagreement. They lean towards reformist or radical discourse, at times weaving them together. What kinds of 'transformation', if any, are SBTs capable of driving? Conceptualising SBTs as a boundary object, we suggest that sustainability transformations involve paradoxical tensions, including where actors appeal to the powerful to drive change, but this inhibits the most radical discourses. We conclude with potential implications for sustainability science and governance.

AB  - More attention has been paid to the circular economy in recent years due to a focus on sustainability. Reverse logistics is an example of this, as it is critical for embracing and implementing the circular economy concept across supply chains. Nowadays, consumers are affecting every aspect of sustainability due to social media's exponential growth. This paper addressed a knowledge gap in sustainability and consumer behavior, which significantly impacts managerial decisions in reverse logistics, leading to reduced waste on returning products. The concept of sustainability is broadened by emphasizing specific aspects, including consumers, profit, the environment, and the company's employees. Additionally, an extended conceptual model of sustainability was proposed, discussed, and analyzed to determine the relationship between reverse logistics performance and sustainability using a brand-new linguistic interval-value hesitant fuzzy DEMATEL technique. The proposed model could be applied to various industries, including food, automotive, and electronics. To this end, the electronics and automotive industries were analyzed and compared. The findings indicated that, in the context of sustainability and to achieve more sustainable reverse logistics, consumers as a new stakeholder, in addition to other stakeholders, play a critical role. The study results could aid managers in governing reverse logistics in a circular economy ecosystem that is sustainable. Additionally, the model proposed in this paper enables policymakers and decision-makers to gain additional insights into developing a more resilient sustainable supply chain.

AB  - The sharing economy has the potential to innovate new markets by making the reuse of idle resources globally. The practices of sharing culture vary among developed and developing countries because of the un-stabilized economic situation and bad infrastructure. (1) This research is based on a case study of transportation network company (TNC) that has the capability to change the conventional transportation system because of its agile nature; (2) the study analyzes the data conducted from Careem (TNC) in Pakistan by using a qualitative approach; (3) the results show that to find a solution for scarcity of products/services in developing countries caused by limited and scattered resources, a learning climate is created by Careem which enables Careem to understand social issues in Pakistan and to use these insights to further develop its business model. Under learning climate, Careem promotes the culture of respect towards collaboration; (4) overall, Careem plays a facilitative leadership role and brings together different stakeholders on one platform for contributing to a common goal to achieve sustainability. Further, with the joint efforts of all stakeholders, an extended service ecosystem has been formed through boundary-spanning activities. Careem acts as a core boundary spanner and supports other organizations to become a second level boundary spanner. Finally, Careem has made a substantial contribution to resolve the problem of unsustainability in Pakistan.

AB  - University quality and its measurement have been strongly on the agenda of university policy since the 1980s. There is no consensus about what a good university is, but increasingly priority has been given to a narrow focus on contribution to supporting economic production and growth, as part of an economy-centred and market-centred conception of society. We argue that a human development approach is also very often relevant in educational policy and evaluation and can assist us to define and characterize a good university. From the following core values of human development-well-being, participation and empowerment, equity and diversity, and sustainability-we propose a list of dimensions for a human development orientation in research, teaching, social engagement and university governance, and then discuss the implications of these values and how they can be used in evaluation and steering of universities' work.

AB  - Although the involvement of stakeholders is believed to be the key to the success of sustainable municipal waste management, the specific features of stakeholders, as well as their interdependence, have been under-researched. This study employed a multilevel governance approach to understand the manner in which different types of stakeholder networks interact with one another and how their roles should be reinforced. A combination of stakeholder analysis (SA) and social network analysis (SNA) was employed to investigate the perspective of stakeholders in utilizing municipal solid waste (MSW) in agriculture in Hanoi, Vietnam. SA indicated that the local authorities take the main responsibility for the management of MSW in Hanoi. Although other stakeholders express a significant interest in recycling MSW through composting, many of them do not have sufficient power to make any changes to the current system. SNA revealed the fragmentation of the network, as the coordination among the stakeholders is dominated by hierarchical governance, while there is a lack of horizontal cooperation among the sectors. The fragmentation could be attributed to weak legislative framework, lack of trust, financial constraints, and the limited participation of private enterprises. The governance of MSW use in agriculture should be executed through interdependency rather than hierarchy and through a network comprising both state and non-state actors.

AB  - Background: The food industry faces longstanding challenges in meeting sustainability practices within its supply chain, often prioritising commercial obligations and profit motives. However, there is a growing recognition of the critical role that sustainable food supply chain management (SFSCM) practices play in enhancing food security. Objectives: This study aims to establish the significance of SFSCM practices in enhancing food security. Furthermore, the study explores approaches to reduce challenges against implementation of SFSCM practices. Method: The study employed a qualitative approach and used stratified and purposive sampling techniques to interview 22 participants from a population of 9 gatekeeper institutions within the Zimbabwean food industry. Results: The findings highlighted several essential SFSCM practices covering waste management, logistics optimisation, water and energy conservation, employing qualified individuals, carbon emission reduction, corporate social responsibility, cost reduction, pricing efficiency, fair food distribution and continuous consumer taste surveys. Approaches to reduce SFSCM implementation challenges were also identified, and these include stakeholder communication plans, capacity building programmes, integrating sustainability into mission statements, budget allocation, lobbying for government support, and fostering collaborative engagements. Open information sharing was also emphasised. Conclusion: It is concluded that the adoption of identified SFSCM practices by food producers, intermediaries, suppliers, consumers and other stakeholders can significantly enhance food security and minimise hunger in nations. Contribution: This article contributes to the understanding of addressing SFSCM implementation challenges and provides valuable insights into the importance of sustainable practices in improving food security within the Zimbabwean food industry and the world at large.

AB  - Exploring the trends of sustainability science research is vital for advancing our understanding of creating a more sustainable and resilient future for our planet and society. This overview article explores a segment of the sustainability science research landscape from 2006 to 2023 by examining articles published in the Sustainability Science journal. The initial step involved categorizing articles into four distinct periods, each representing a phase in the journal and field's evolution. The changing research topics and their interconnectedness were investigated by involving natural language processing, non-negative matrix factorization topic modeling, and Jaccard similarity analysis in Python. The study reveals shifting emphases over these periods: 2006-2010 focused on human-environment links; 2011-2015 shifted to practical solutions, such as climate adaptation; 2016-2020 focused on the integration of transdisciplinary knowledge, SDGs, and sustainability transitions; and 2021-2023 centered on transformative changes in sustainability. Based on the Sustainability Science journal publications, the field has evolved from foundational principles to current priorities such as transdisciplinary approaches, deep sustainability transformations, bioeconomy, and intergenerational narratives. The evolving landscape responds to environmental, societal, cultural, and technological changes. While the Sustainability Science journal has played an essential role, there remains potential to further concentrate on emerging topics and transformative methodologies. This study offers valuable insights into propelling sustainability science forward to address global challenges and pave the way for a sustainable and equitable future.

AB  - Scholars and practitioners generally see participation as a crucial element of governance strategies in pursuit of the goals of the German energy transformation. Research has focused on how to involve which groups of citizens in what kind of formats. The role of other "key actors", who organize, moderate, and participate as decisionmakers or experts, has received much less attention. What functions do they fulfill and how do they influence the processes? How do they experience the processes and what does this experience imply for the ability of such processes to reach their transformative potential? This paper pursues these questions based on a survey with 148 key actors within the German Energiewende. It analyzes the range of tasks of key actors as well as their experience in terms of core social and cognitive dynamics in the participatory processes. We find that key actors can exercise a wide range of forms of influence, and that this influence is often further enhanced due to the multiple roles that individuals play. This aspect shows a risk that needs to be addressed: the potential lack of neutrality of particularly influential actors, tasked with organizing, moderating, mediating, and/or informing the participating citizens. Moreover, participation can prompt social learning among key actors, thereby underlining the potential contribution of participation to a sustainability transformation. Still, such learning does not provide a guarantee for conflict resolution.

AB  - Poor teamwork skills in healthcare have been found to be a contributing cause of negative incidents in patient care, whilst effective teamwork has been linked to more positive patient outcomes. The aim of this research is to explore views of patients and informal caregivers on the key characteristics of effective healthcare teams and their experiences of healthcare teams using a qualitative approach. A focus group schedule was developed from existing literature to explore this. Topics included the purpose and value of teams in patient care, key attributes and their impact on patient care. Patients and informal caregivers were recruited via convenience sampling. Three focus groups were conducted. Thematic analysis identified a number of themes associated with effective teams. These themes included the perceived purpose of teams, perceptions about the structure of a team, team-based communication, the role of patients, delivery of care. Research participants noted the importance of key characteristics in effective teams, but felt that these were not always consistently present. Communication was considered to be the most important attribute in team working and also appeared to be the area in which the patient experience can be significantly improved. It is clear from the findings of this research that further improvements in teamwork skills in healthcare are needed to achieve effective collaborative practice, sustainable service delivery models and optimal patient care.

AB  - The legacy of racial and spatial segregation in South Africa has left an epistemic chasm between knowledge-producing institutions and members of disadvantaged communities most in need of applying scientific knowledge to address their local societal challenges. The aim of this study is to examine how the co-learning approach can be used to bridge the knowledge asymmetry between university researchers and communities within which their institutions are embedded by building bonds of mutual trust and involving target knowledge users in the design and testing of technological solutions targeted to their needs. Using the outcome mapping (OM) analysis of project documents and key informant interviews of participants in the co-learning project between the University of Johannesburg and Soweto smallholder farmers, this study illustrates the contribution of the co-learning approach to shaping networks of successful innovation co-creation. Our findings indicate that co-learning leads to the optimisation of the capacity building speed when co-learning partners have a shared commitment to the outcomes and application of the co-created knowledge.

AB  - Blood loss associated with lower-extremity total joint arthroplasty (TJA) often results in anemia and the need for red blood cell transfusions (RBCTs). This article reports on a quality improvement initiative aimed at improving blood management strategies in patients undergoing TJA. A multifaceted intervention (preoperative anemia assessment, use of tranexamic acid, discouragement of autologous preoperative blood collection, restrictive RBCT protocols) was implemented. The results were stratified into 3 intervention periods: 1, pre; 2, peri; and 3, post. Fractional logistic regression was used to describe differences between various intervention periods. During the study period, 2511 patients underwent TJA. Compared with the preintervention period, there was 81.8% decrease in total units of RBCT during the postintervention period. Using activity-based costing (similar to$1000/unit), the annualized saving in RBC expenditure was $480000. A multidisciplinary approach can be successful and sustainable in reducing RBCT and its associated costs for patients undergoing TJA.

AB  - Using the sustainable livelihoods framework to evaluate the impact of a farmer-to-farmer video on the improved rice parboiling technology, women in Benin rated financial, social, human, natural and physical capital stocks for the baseline year (2006) and the impact year (2009) on a 0-5 scale. Women who had watched the video and those who had not, but who lived in the same villages, perceived a significant improvement in four out of five livelihood capitals while processors in control villages did not perceive any significant change. Apart from testing the sustainable livelihoods conceptual framework as a participatory impact assessment tool for video-mediated rural learning, this study shows how farmer-to-farmer training videos helped to improve multiple livelihood assets.

AB  - Purpose Advanced skills in communication, teamwork and stakeholder engagement are widely recognized as important success factors for advancing sustainability. While project-based learning formats claim to advance such skills, there is little empirical evidence that demonstrates how interpersonal competence is being developed. This study aims to describe and explains teaching and learning processes of project-based sustainability courses that contribute to the development of interpersonal competence as one of the key competencies in sustainability. Design/methodology/approach This study on an international project-based learning course adopted a multi-method case study approach, triangulating observations, semi-structured interviews and focus groups supported by Photovoice method through which students tracked their learning processes. Data collection and analysis followed a grounded theory approach. Findings Learning through and from conflicts within a learning community can foster competence development in teamwork, communication and stakeholder engagement. This study identified inner and outer conflicts (within individuals versus between individuals or groups) as potential drivers of learning processes, depending on strategies applied to address these conflicts. Originality value The value of this study is fourfold: it demonstrates how conflicts can be leveraged for students' competence development; it provides in-depth empirical data from multiple perspectives, it discusses the findings in the context of teaching and learning theories, and it demonstrates an application of the Photovoice method to track and improve teaching and learning processes.

AB  - The delivery of sustainable development goals (SDGs) through a participatory land and forest conservation initiative was evaluated in South Kalimantan Province, Indonesia. The initiative focused on the rehabilitation of a 410 ha forest that was managed by local villagers. A forest rehabilitation and management initiative was developed through participatory action, establishing a well-managed rubber plantation that provided new livelihood opportunities. Poverty reduction was promoted, evidenced by a reduction in inequality amongst the local community. Between 2010 and 2018 the Gini coefficient of inequality declined from 34.6% to 31.3%, demonstrating a contribution to SDGs 1 (No Poverty) and 10 (Reduced Inequalities). In addition, forest rehabilitation resulted in improved carbon stock and biodiversity management contributing to SDG15 (Life on Land). This was attributed to successful forest rehabilitation and the reduced incidence of forest fires. Cooperation amongst local villagers categorized as living in poor households was improved, facilitated by capacity building. This focused on rubber plantation management, cooperative action, and firefighting activities. This capacity building contributed to the delivery of SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals). Results from a socio-economic survey demonstrated that group activities and cooperation amongst stakeholders were essential to improve both livelihoods and forest management practices.

AB  - This paper explores the way in which academics address the role of innovation spaces in the development of the circular economy. Considering their characteristics, objectives, and functioning, we assume that innovation spaces can be favorable environments for eco-innovations facilitating the implementation of circular economy strategies. To examine this hypothesis, this paper mobilizes a mixed research method based on bibliometric analysis of keywords and content analysis. The results show that these collaborative environments can: foster sustainable experimental learning, provide methodologies and tools for the co-creation of circular solutions, drive the transition toward sustainable smart cities, foster the creation of new sustainable business models, promote sustainable urban entrepreneurship, and facilitate knowledge exchange on circular solutions. However, most of the reviewed literature focuses mainly on their impacts on sustainability and less on the concept of the circular economy per se. Consequently, this work provides insights on the potential of these spaces in the circular strategies' implementation.

AB  - The paper describes the facilitated learning process of farm households and district policy makers in addressing the problem of soil nutrient depletion. The process is applied in a case study in four districts in Kenya and Uganda during the period 1997-1999, where the potentials of low-external input technologies (LEIA) in addressing the soil nutrient depletion problem were assessed. Working through an inclusive process of dialogue, observation, diagnosis, experimentation and exposure to different types of knowledge, participants made a thorough analysis of the current soil fertility situation and tested various LEIA options for improving soil fertility management. In all four research sites the future agricultural productivity is threatened by soil nutrient depletion. Maximal use of locally available nutrients through LEIA techniques, combined with optimal use of external nutrients appears to be the most appropriate strategy in the existing economic environment. Long-term and intensive collaboration between research institutions on the one hand and extension services, non-government and community based organisations on the other are a prerequisite for a successful and sustainable implementation of a facilitated learning approach. Involvement of stakeholders in the various stages of the research process, including the planning and project formulation is essential for an effective follow-up and implementation of the results. More attention needs to be paid to the development of communication tools to enable an effective interaction between policy makers and researchers. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Rangelands, home to herders, grazed by livestock and wildlife and, defined predominately as grasslands, comprise approximately 40% of the earth's terrestrial land surface. Rangeland social-ecological system resilience is urgent in many regions under climate, land use, political, market, and demographic changes. Focused on community-based natural resource management collaboratives, researchers and practitioners from Kenya, Mongolia and the US West, gathered to develop a research-for-action project. Using a conceptual framework for development of transdisciplinary global change research a project was co-designed to address natural resource problems to help build resilience in collaborative organizations under change. Participants designed a research agenda and conceptualized a knowledge network. The co-design process showed the common visions of this group from around the world while also demonstrating the actual untidiness of development of transdisciplinary research involving diverse participants.

AB  - Sustainability benchmarking is the process of comparing indicators of performance with other organizations to identify, adapt and implement best practice approaches for sustainability improvement. The benchmarking process is more likely to incentivise and guide sustainable practice if it is based on fair and sensible comparisons, accommodating features such as local biophysical and economic constraints, in order to place all farmers on a "level playing field". This study developed a benchmarking rationale accommodating local opportunities and constraints for effectively incentivising locally-tuned sustainability improvements. This was carried out by analysing energy and water use on the 1103 vineyards enrolled in the Sustainable Wine-growing New Zealand scheme. Regression models to predict spatial and temporal variations of energy and water use explained relatively large proportions of the resource use variance. Production area and region were common and significant predictors of resource efficiency. A 59% increase over time in fuel efficiency took place in vineyards instigating energy reduction plans and actions. The vineyards' rank performance differed widely when benchmarked within the entire sector or within other vineyards of equivalent characteristics, specifically for agroecological and production related characteristics influencing performance. For example, one vineyard ranked at the 20 percentile in fuel efficiency within the sector, yet at the 75 percentile when compared against vineyards in its own region and with a similar production area. Aggregated and non-locally tuned benchmarking might best suit consumers and national-level policy makers, but they do not capture the local and diverse challenges faced by the individual farmers. Use of locally-tuned benchmarking approaches can better identify actual sustainability improvement opportunities and may enhance farmers' trust in the sustainability exercise, improve participation and better incentivise change towards sustainability.

AB  - PurposeThe first aim of this paper was to discuss the learning experience of university students who participated in a service-learning project on sustainable water management. By investigating the students' engagement in a real-world, community-based project, this study also aimed to provide insights into the effectiveness of service-learning as a pedagogical approach for sustainable development education.Design/methodology/approachThis paper presented a service-learning project organized by The Hong Kong Polytechnic University on improving water quality in low-income communities. An overview of the project was provided, including the curriculum design, project contents, implementation process, as well as students' assessments, evaluation and feedback. Based on students' assessments, the outcomes and impacts of this project were discussed. Additionally, several barriers were identified during this project, and corresponding suggestions were proposed to improve the service quality and increase its positive impacts.FindingsThe students established 12 water filtration systems to improve the water quality in a needy village overseas. Apart from the benefits to the service recipients, the participating students experienced personal development and civic engagement measured in 10 aspects, including the application of classroom learning, adaptive problem-solving, creative thinking, community contribution, commitment to helping the disadvantaged, empathy and compassion, concern for those in need, moral commitment to civic affairs, multi-perspective analysis and informed decision-making.Originality/valueAlthough the recorded project was not the first international service-learning project on water sustainable management, to the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first time that the whole procedure of the service-learning project was documented as a compulsory credit-bearing subject in Hong Kong universities. With the water sustainability project example, this paper shows how to integrate service-learning subjects into university curricula and what benefits and challenges they could bring.

AB  - The prevalence of security vulnerabilities in Internet of Things (IoT) applications poses a serious threat to enterprise systems, necessitating sophisticated and reliable defense solutions to counter emerging and evolving threats. For the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), stakeholders require trustworthy and sustainable systems that can prevent the loss of human life during critical operations. The impact of multi-variant persistent and sophisticated bot attacks on connected IIoTs is potentially catastrophic, and their detection presents a highly complex and critical challenge. Therefore, there is a pressing need for efficient and timely detection of IIoT botnet attacks. This research paper proposes a robust deep learning model named AttackNet for the detection and classification of different botnet attacks in IIoT based on adaptive based CNN-GRU model. The model is extensively evaluated using the latest dataset and standard performance evaluation metrics, demonstrating its capacity to protect IIoT networks against sophisticated cyber-attacks with a testing accuracy of 99.75%, a loss of 0.0063, precision and recall score of 99.75% and 99.74% respectively. Our proposed model demonstrates superior accuracy, particularly within the N_BaIoT dataset. It achieves an outstanding accuracy of 99.75% across ten classes, surpassing state-of-the-art techniques by a substantial margin ranging from 3.2% to 16.07%. Moreover, the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art anomaly detection systems in IIoT based on a real-time IoT device dataset in terms of detecting and classifying botnet attacks accurately.

AB  - Background: Formal reflection assignments help students process and learn from engagement experiences more fully. Guided reflection can help students engage more deeply with out-of-the-classroom learning experiences and record personal learning. However, it is unknown if students perceive such assignments as valuable. Purpose: This study examined undergraduate students' attitudes toward journaling assignments during a one-week study-away experience within an academic course. Methodology/ Approach: The engagement experience comprised firsthand learning about sustainability and energy practices and related policies in Colorado. Qualitative data were collected from nine participants via pre- and post-travel surveys. Thematic analysis was used. Findings/Conclusions: Four themes emerged: prompts helped to elicit quality reflections; journaling enabled integration of learning, emotions, and plans; journaling served as a retrospective resource and reinforces learning; and students felt constrained by the time commitment and public nature of journaling assignments. Implications: Findings suggest that journaling can help reinforce learning and help students monitor their learning, feelings, and plans.

AB  - Purpose: Intensive actions implemented to alleviate poverty created many challenges. Millions of people face acute food insecurity; hence, food production needs to be increased to feed the existing and increasing population through sustainable agricultural practices. Sustainable agricultural development is the only way forward to assist humanity. Research Method: TExisting literature on sustainable agriculture was reviewed, explored, understood, described, evaluated, and synthesized and their relationships to sustain smallholder farmers were analyzed. Findings: Technological innovations in increasing resource use efficiency, modern breeding techniques, and renewable energy sources aid in achieving sustainability in agriculture. Technology enhances the adaption of agriculture to climate change and increases productivity and the quality of life of farming communities. Smallholder farms with limited information and transportation need government support to access markets with modern commercialization channels. Women need to be empowered to deliver multiple agricultural roles. Wise use of natural resources, optimum allocation, and utilization of resources are vital in enhancing farm productivity. Technical knowledge, availability of inputs, extension services, and financial support are paramount in maximizing productivity and income from agriculture. Agricultural investments need substantial increments to address food insecurity and adaptation to climate change. Dissemination of research findings and experience in sustainable agricultural production practices in informal and formal ways among all agricultural stakeholders is vital in achieving agricultural sustainability. Minimizing postharvest losses through technologies is essential in minimizing global food insecurity to enhance smallholder farmers' income. Policies related to social, economic, eco-friendly production strategies and environmental aspects directly and indirectly linked to agriculture are vital in these processes. Hence, an integral approach towards the agricultural development of smallholder and subsistence farmers can lead them to sustainability ensuring their food security.

AB  - In contemporary academia, accreditation stands as a vital process for universities to uphold their reputation and deliver quality education to students. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) significantly contribute to this process by enabling institutions to assess their performance in crucial areas, such as student outcomes, faculty engagement, and research effectiveness. To achieve sustainable accreditation, universities necessitate a comprehensive data management system capable of handling extensive data and generating pertinent insights. High-quality education remains paramount for academic institutions to equip students with essential professional skills, thereby enabling societal economic advancement. A sustainable quality management system is an innovative approach emphasizing continuous improvement and long-term planning to enhance an organization's overall performance and maintain a competitive edge within the sector. This paper presents a case study on sustainable quality assurance in higher education, underscoring the importance of KPIs in accreditation and the need for a robust data management system to ensure sustainability. Additionally, it highlights the significance of delivering high-quality education and the role of a sustainable quality management system in realizing this objective.

AB  - Applying the participatory approach alone to development projects has yet to lead to the active participation of the marginalized in African development projects. A qualitative phenomenological research design was utilized. The study purposively included six communities across Delta State, Nigeria, based on the presence of development projects. Eighteen participants with high incomes and above, and 18 participants with low incomes and below were included in the study using the snowball sampling technique. The total sample size for the study was 36. Unstructured interviews were used to collect data, which were thematically analyzed.
   Findings The findings, which are of significant importance, revealed that the studied communities benefited from town halls, open-stall markets, borehole water, roads, primary health care centers, primary schools, secondary schools, irrigations, electricity, and hospitals. The participants with low incomes and below indicated a low level of participation in the development projects due to poverty, lack of formal education, inadequate information, government interference, male domination, lack of interest, and discriminatory cultural practices. The participants with high incomes and above indicated a high level of participation believing that they were better positioned to participate in development-related matters in the communities.
   Applications The findings suggest a promising potential for change. There is a clear need for social work educators to adopt the empowerment-participatory approach into Nigerian social work curricula, and social work practitioners should apply it for active community participation, and sustainability in Nigerian and African development projects.

AB  - Sustainable energy transformation depends on learning processes, which allow us to cope with constantly changing environmental and social systems. Participation processes are viewed as a means of fostering social learning. In this paper, social learning is applied as an analytical concept to investigate the cognitive effects of participation such as knowledge acquisition, changes of perspective, and knowledge dissemination. Previous studies have indicated that certain characteristics of the participation process foster social learning. However, empirical evidence is still inconclusive, which is why this paper investigates which factors foster social learning. An empirical analysis was conducted on the basis of a quantitative online survey (N = 516), which questioned people who are in some way involved in the German energy transformation (Energiewende). The results show that social learning can be enhanced through participation. In particular, moderated processeswhich foster a productive exchange, encourage the building of trust among participants, and allow easy access to relevant informationare likely to provide the appropriate conditions for social learning. Personal characteristics such as an individual's degree of knowledge might have a greater influence on why people change their perspectives than the intensity of participation.

AB  - Decision makers need accurate information to address climate variability and change and accelerate transformation to sustainability. A stakeholder-driven, science-based multimodel approach has been developed and used by the Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project (AgMIP) to generate actionable information for adaptation planning processes. For a range of mid-century climate projections-likely to be hotter, drier, and more variable-contrasting future socio-economic scenarios (Representative Agricultural Pathways, RAPs) were co-developed with stakeholders to portray a sustainable development scenario and a rapid economic growth pathway. The unique characteristic of this application is the integration of a multi- modeling approach with stakeholder engagement to co-develop scenarios and adaptation strategies. Distribution of outcomes were simulated with climate, crop, livestock, and economic impact assessment models for smallholder crop livestock farmers in a typical dryland agro-ecological zone in Zimbabwe, characterized by low and erratic rainfall and nutrient depleted soils. Results showed that in Nkayi District, Western Zimbabwe, climate change would threaten most of the farms, and, in particular, those with large cattle herds due to feed shortages. Adaptation strategies that showed the most promise included diversification using legume production, soil fertility improvement, and investment in conducive market environments. The switch to more legumes in the farming systems reduced the vulnerability of the very poor as well as the more resourced farmers. Overall, the sustainable development scenario consistently addressed institutional failures and motivated productivity-enhancing, environmentally sound technologies and inclusive development approaches. This yielded more favorable outcomes than investment in quick economic wins from commercializing agriculture.

AB  - Teaching sustainability concepts to multidisciplinary classes of engineering students is challenging due to their diverse background and discipline-specific skill set and the interdisciplinary nature of the sustainability issues at stake. The present study was conducted to understand the challenges and identify opportunities for improving teaching and learning of sustainability in higher education institutions. The case study used for data collection was the Sustainable Engineering and International Development course taught at Iowa State University since 2005. We assessed the students' course content knowledge before and after the course and their perceptions about the overall course, content, and instruction methods. A mixed methods approach consisting of qualitative (focus groups) and quantitative (survey and pre- and post-assessment) techniques was used for the study. Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, explanatory analysis, and multinomial logistic regression. Thematic analysis was used to evaluate the qualitative data. The difficulty level of the pre- and post-assessment was low. Application-based questions could be included in the assessment to test beyond the levels of mere comprehension and memorization. Student perceptions about module usefulness exhibited year-to-year variation, which was attributed to the diversity of students enrolled in the course each year. Barriers to learning in a multidisciplinary engineering course included student difficulties working in multidisciplinary teams, course organization, and limited student engagement in projects. The assessment techniques were complementary, aiding in the identification of strategies to improve teaching and learning in multidisciplinary engineering environment.

AB  - Understanding the spatiotemporal decoupling effects among economic development, energy consumption, and carbon dioxide emissions is paramount to achieving sustainable development. This relationship sheds light on how regions can grow economically while managing their energy resources efficiently and minimizing environmental impacts. This study examines the critical and globally relevant issue of spatiotemporal decoupling that includes economic development, energy consumption, and carbon dioxide emissions in Xinjiang Province from 2006 to 2020. The Tapio Elasticity Analysis Method is utilized to achieve this objective. We found that the early years showed expansive coupling, reflecting a phase where economic growth was closely tied to increases in energy consumption and emissions. However, over time, particularly post-2010, there is a noticeable shift towards weak decoupling and eventually to more substantial forms of decoupling. The primary sector displayed mostly weak and strong decoupling. The secondary sector, however, showed fluctuating decoupling states. In the tertiary sector, a generally weak decoupling was observed. A spatial analysis across Xinjiang's prefectures and cities revealed pronounced regional variations. This investigation validates the effectiveness of regional ecological policies and illustrates the necessity of tailored strategies to foster sustainable development. Our findings provide valuable insights not only for regional policymakers but also for international stakeholders aiming to achieve sustainable development. The results underline the importance of tailored strategies in different regions, contributing to the broader understanding of sustainable development dynamics.

AB  - Cities amplify the risks from climate change and advance opportunities to address them. Scientific research offers an evidence-based approach to understanding challenges, and possible responses available to local decision makers as they manage the interface between climate change and urban environments. In March 2018, academics, practitioners and policymakers convened at the Cities and Climate Change Science Conference in Edmonton, Canada to develop an understanding of the science needed to support cities as they mitigate and adapt to climate change. This paper evaluates the process and central output of the conference, to determine how effective the transdisciplinary stakeholders were in using the conference as a platform to explore knowledge on the relationship between cities and climate change science. The paper deploys a sustainability scientific framework centred around the theme of transdisciplinarity to analyse conference documentation and interviews with academic/research, practitioner and policymaker conference organisers. Structural arrangements, power differentials, and assumptions about the prioritisation of scientific knowledge, meant that transdisciplinarity was not always achieved. Yet while the academic voice was dominant, diverse conversations were still held, as seen in the inclusion of and recognition given to the Global South issue of urban informality in the main conference output - a Global Research and Action Agenda for Cities and Climate Change Science. Through applying a framework to evaluate participatory research for sustainability, recounting some of the learnings from this methodological approach, and suggesting how the framework could be amended for future application this paper contributes towards the knowledge on evaluation of sustainability research.

AB  - Introduction: Diabetes foot ulceration (DFU) presents an enormous burden to those living with diabetes and to the local health systems and economies. There is an increasing interest in implementing integrated care models to enhance the quality of care for people living with diabetes and related complications and the value of co-production approaches to achieve sustainable change. This paper aims to describe the evaluation methodology for the North West London (NWL) Diabetes Foot Care Transformation project.
   Description: A mixed methods design including: i) a quasi-experimental quantitative analysis assessing the impact of the implementation of the local secondary care multidisciplinary diabetes foot team clinics on service utilisation and clinical outcomes (amputations and number of healed patients); ii) a phenomenological, qualitative study to explore patient and staff experience; and iii) a within-trial cost-effectiveness analysis (pre and post 2017) to evaluate the programme cost-effectiveness.
   Discussion and Conclusion: Demonstrating the impact of multidisciplinary, integrated care models and the value of co-production approaches is important for health providers and commissioners trying to improve health outcome. Evaluation is also needed to identify strategies to overcome barriers which might have reduced the impact of the programme and key elements for improvement.

AB  - This paper aimed to map the existing sustainable manufacturing literature to explore and classify existing practices to highlight the potential prospect of and obstacles to achieving manufacturing sustainability in countries in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). This paper systematically reviews the research on sustainable manufacturing in the ASEAN region from 2011 to 2020. We used the PRISMA framework for systematic literature, and 118 research articles specific to the ASEAN region were identified through a structured keyword search in Web of Science, SCOPUS, ProQuest, and other databases. After a careful screening process, only 115 records were found appropriate to be included for review in the current study. The results revealed three significant sets of manufacturing practices that are widely used for sustainable manufacturing. These are sustainable product development, sustainable manufacturing performance, and environmental assessment and monitoring. Furthermore, we conducted a bibliometric analysis of the literature to highlight ASEAN countries' collaborative efforts to achieve sustainability in manufacturing. The findings indicate that most of the earlier work on sustainable manufacturing focused on environmental assessment practices rather than providing holistic industrial engineering solutions. We recommend that the efforts focus on hybrid processes to establish sustainable manufacturing procedures in ASEAN member countries. Holistic solutions through industrial processing integration need to be developed to provide broader industrial solutions to protect the environment and society from the adverse effects of the manufacturing process with economic efficiency.

The sustainability of transformative agency can easily be diminished by activities becoming routine-like after a formative intervention ends. However, can employees maintain and develop their transformative agency by sustaining the principle of double stimulation initially used in the formative intervention? In this paper a qualitative analysis of double stimulation and the method of analyzing discursive expressions of transformative agency are integrated to look at the sustainability of transformative agency. The double stimulation setting emerged as a process during which the employees constructed the first stimulus explicating the need for participatory development of their work activity. The second stimulus was constructed in a longitudinal process of designing a meeting practice with the help of material artifacts and instruments. The continuous use of the second stimulus enabled the sustainability of transformative agency. Based on our findings we suggest that it is possible to sustain transformative agency when employees, with the help of a durable yet flexible second stimulus, persistently keep identifying problems and constructing means to solve their problems after the formative intervention.

AB  - Introduction Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) present a significant health challenge globally, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Effective Implementation Research (IR) is vital in addressing this challenge, with stakeholder engagement playing a crucial role. However, the landscape of stakeholder engagement in NCD IR within LMICs faces unique challenges, including resource constraints and power imbalances. Despite these challenges, stakeholder engagement offers substantial benefits, including improved research relevance and sustainability of interventions.Methods and analysis This scoping review aims to comprehensively describe the current practices of stakeholder engagement in NCD IR within LMICs. Employing a two-stage screening process and a thematic synthesis approach based on the International Association for Public Participation Spectrum of Public Participation, the review will analyse studies meeting predefined eligibility criteria. A rigorous search strategy will be implemented across identified electronic databases and grey literature sources, including published studies from 2011 to present. Data will be charted using a standardised form, and information regarding study characteristics, NCD focus, LMIC context, stakeholder engagement method and reported outcomes/findings will be collected. This scoping review will follow a standard protocol adhering to the methodological framework outlined by Arksey and O'Malley to comprehensively map existing evidence on stakeholder engagement in NCD IR within LMICs.Ethics and dissemination Ethical considerations involve respecting original authors, maintaining integrity and transparency, managing data ethically and disclosing conflicts of interest. Dissemination will occur through publication in peer-reviewed journals, conference presentations, open-access repositories, policy briefs, stakeholder engagement activities and social media platforms.Registration This scoping review protocol is registered on Open Science Framework, with the Digital Object Identifier 10.17605/OSF.IO/ACQ5210.17605/OSF.IO/ACQ52, ensuring transparency and accountability in the research process.

AB  - Transformational family engagement fundamentally changes relationships between families and schools and interrupts deeply held beliefs about low-income, Black, Latinx, Indigenous, or immigrant families, each of which are rooted in systems of racism, classism, sexism, xenophobia, and their intersections. In this paper, we use a community-based collective impact theoretical framework to better understand how the KY Collaborative is aligned with transformational family engagement strategies and promotes and implements systemic, statewide evidenced-based family engagement policies and practices. We present data from interviews with KY Collaborative partners, observations of KY Collaborative events and activities, and survey data. Key findings suggest the KY Collaborative leverages each regional partner's strengths to break through historical barriers that fail to acknowledge the critical role families play both within and outside of schools. Their collective programs and services demonstrate a commitment to strengthening families, building capacity amongst schools and educators, and supporting communities to achieve educational equity. Our findings present implications for other statewide family engagement centers and community-based collaborations for transformational family engagement by highlighting the ways in which the KY Collaborative develops bottom-up leadership, builds dual capacity, shifts power, attends to policy change, and diffuses shared messages, visions, and practices statewide.

AB  - The promotion of sustainability and resilience within urban environments is widely recognized as an essential approach to educating urban communities through innovative strategies and tools. This paper presents a process for integrating stakeholders into urban growth simulation, thereby enhancing sustainable decision-making. Currently, most urban growth models fail to incorporate the perspectives of diverse stakeholders, leading to reduced equitable participation in the decision-making process. To achieve long-term sustainability, it is imperative to include the input and viewpoints of stakeholders. This study follows a four-step approach: identifying relevant stakeholders, developing the framework, evaluating its effectiveness, and documenting lessons learned. The framework involves key steps, including initial participatory modeling, analysis of development pressures and suitability with stakeholders, and technical urban growth modeling. A unique combination of modeling tools and an innovative approach was employed, incorporating the default FUTURES (GRASS-GIS) model alongside the CA-Markov Chain, Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) (NetLogo), the Cellular-Automata-based Python model, and MOLUSCE-QGIS. This integrated approach facilitates the inclusion of stakeholder-based knowledge into conventional urban growth modeling, providing novel local lessons in science, technology, and innovation initiatives. Validation was conducted through both technical and stakeholder mechanisms, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

AB  - Small and medium-sized tourism companies (SMEs) strongly depend on their collaborators to achieve competitiveness and sustainability. In this sense, these organizations need to identify those factors that help them to use their resources and efforts to achieve the aforementioned goals. This article proposes a model oriented to organizational sustainability in the tourism sector. A systemic approach was adopted to articulate this research; therefore, the soft systems methodology was applied to structure the problem and express a conceptual model that suggests relationships as an alternative solution to the expressed problem. Partial least squares path modeling was applied to statistically validate the relationships expressed in the construct. Results suggest that the relationships proposed in the construct are valid and may promote organizational sustainability. The ideas developed are restricted to the organizational domain and although the results apply in a Mexican context, this potential limitation can be offset by the multi-methodological approach proposed, extending the model's application to other types of organizations. This study may enable scholars and managers to improve communication and inter-organizational relationships, allowing organizations to focus their strategies and efforts using systems thinking to increase responsiveness and adaptation.

AB  - Soil degradation and conservation is an environmental, social, economical and cultural issue concerning the wellbeing of all humankind. With one-fifth of the world's soils currently degraded, and continuing to degrade at a rate of 5-10 billion hectares annually, the burden and responsibility of addressing soil conservation and managment falls on every individual; farmer, land owner, indigenous community, politician, scientist, worldleader and the general public. The causes of soil degradation are multifaceted with natural and anthropogenic drivers of global change creating a reduction in soil function, ecosystem services and land productivity, resulting in the deterioration of the social and economic framework of society. To combat land degradation among other issues, the United Nations General Assembly created 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as part of the "2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development". These goals highlight the importance of soil conservation by uniting landholders globally to achieve Zero Net Land Degradation. However, these SDGs are only the first step in identifying the issues associated with land degradation and future targets. Further consideration of soil indicators along with landholder engagement is required to evaluate the progress of sustainable land. Governments and scientists need to nurture collaboration with farmers, create policy that supports and strengthens sustainable land management and increase knowledge sharing at all levels of governance and in the education system. Through coordinated, collaborated and sustainable management of our soils we can create resilient and productive landscapes capable of supporting a growing human population in the context of global change.

AB  - Educators are being challenged to develop transformational learning experiences that link student attainment of sustainability competencies to professional skills required in specific industries. However, these efforts can sometimes be hamstrung by traditional curricula and institutional structures. This study on an industry-led learning experience, the Timber Development UK University Design Challenge, evaluates how successful it has been in fostering student learning in net zero skills, renewables (materials and technologies) and engineering approaches critical for twenty-first century construction professionals whilst also focusing on sustainability outcomes and operating outside an established curriculum or program. The results demonstrate a method for implementing interdisciplinary challenge-based learning in engineering for sustainable development within built environment fields, and for developing or enhancing links with industries and community organisations. More broadly, this work supports education around decarbonisation of the built environment, upskilling the twenty-first century workforce, developing a more circular economy, and emphasising collaborative and regenerative design.

AB  - New approaches to generating knowledge are needed to achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Participatory action research (PAR) builds on and expands the scientific process through engagement of scientists (ecological, agricultural, and social) with stakeholders in a systematic manner. To illustrate iterative co-learning cycles, we report on two decades of PAR in rural communities in Malawi. Novel findings include the expansion of agricultural diversity beyond agroforestry to meet farmer requirements while enhancing redundancy and supporting a broad range of functions. Insights from farmers facilitated identification of the value of intermediate growth habits (such as those of shrubs and vines) as "goldilocks" crop types that tighten nutrient cycles in mixed farming systems while providing multiple harvests of nutritious seeds and forage. This illustrates how PAR involves co-design with stakeholders and learning by doing, to meet local needs and mediate trade-offs, as well as generate knowledge that addresses SDGs.

AB  - BackgroundAedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus are primary vectors of emerging or re-emerging arboviruses that threaten public health worldwide. Many efforts have been made to develop interventions to control these Aedes species populations. Still, countries in the Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) region struggle to create/design/develop sustainable and effective control strategies. This scoping review synthesises evidence concerning the effectiveness of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus prevention and control interventions performed in LAC (2000-2021). The findings can be used to evaluate, compare and develop more effective control strategies.
   Methodology The review is based on the methodology by Joanna Briggs Institute for conducting a scoping review. The MEDLINE (via PubMed and Web of Science), Cochrane Library, Scopus, EMBASE and ScienceDirect databases were used to search for articles. Grey literature was searched from governmental and non-governmental organisation websites. Four reviewers independently screened all titles and abstracts and full-text of the articles using the Rayyan web application, based on pre-defined eligibility criteria.
   Results A total of 122 publications were included in the review. Most studies focused on dengue virus infection and data on Ae. aegypti. Entomological data were mainly used to determine the intervention's effectiveness. An integrated control intervention was the most commonly employed strategy in both regions. Biological control measures, environmental management, and health education campaigns on community participation achieved more sustainable results than an intervention where only a chemical control measure was used. Challenges to implementing interventions were insufficient financial support, resources, workforce, intersectoral collaboration and legislation.
   Conclusions Based on the synthesised data, an integrated vector (Aedes) management focused on community participation seems to be the most effective approach to mitigate Aedes-borne infectious diseases. Maintaining the approach's effect remains challenging as it requires multisectoral and multi-disciplinary team engagement and active community participation. Future research needs to address the barriers to program implementation and maintenance as data on this topic is lacking.

AB  - An African Vice-Chancellors' Regional Food Systems Dialogue was hosted with the aim to provide a multi-stakeholder platform for stakeholders to explore various existing and emerging approaches that have the potential to deliver sustainable solutions at scale and encourage collaborative actions to directly transform Africa's agriculture and food systems. Various food system experts and leaders from policy research institutions, universities, and other stakeholders participated. A lack of coherent linkages among stakeholders, youth restlessness, and silos within and between higher education institutions were some of the challenges identified to hindering the much needed transformation. Poor links with ministries and political red tape, inadequate programme funding and capital for coping with rising input costs, as well as unsustainable resource mobilization were also reported as having a negative effect. To address these, stakeholders must embrace collaboration and transdisciplinary practices, mobilize resources, and harness partnerships for greater leverage. In addition, a systems-thinking approach to dealing with complex issues should be adopted, while partners co-design and co-create research initiatives. Information and Communications Technology (ICT) and Big Data were identified as key enablers that can ensure relevant research with appropriate translation into practice while maintaining quality and excellence. This research-together with society-relevant curriculums with emphasis on agricultural sciences and practical on-farm skills-must inform policies and practice. Higher education institutions must be committed to driving the sustainable food system transformation agenda in partnership with other stakeholders. Institutions must be at the forefront of reimagining the sector's role when it comes to transdisciplinary knowledge co-creation aimed at strengthening the continent's agro-food systems.

AB  - Over time, the concept of sustainable development may transform into a business practice that mandates organizations to contemplate the interconnectedness between economic, social, and environmental factors. For organizations to grow in a competitive market, they should adopt cohesive policies founded on reliable sustainability strategies and combine this with efficient knowledge sharing. This approach supports an organization's growth and enhances its social reputation. That is, these elements may be considered important for an organization's growth in a competitive market. Building upon this context, we used structural equation modeling (SEM) to examine the structural correlations between organizational sustainability policies, supplier sustainability, online knowledge sharing, and external factors that encourage sustainable practices. This study's originality and novelty lie in its proposal of a conceptual model that connects all these factors within a coherent framework, thus extending the existing literature on this topic. Our results confirm that external factors have a positive relationship with sustainability policies and that sustainability policies positively impact supplier sustainability and online knowledge sharing. We emphasize the importance of considering internal and external factors when implementing sustainable procedures and the need for authentic communication with stakeholders to integrate sustainable practices successfully. The findings can assist managers in comprehending the factors that impact a company's sustainability strategies and in adapting policies to address environmental and social concerns.

AB  - Evaluating initiatives implemented across multiple settings can elucidate how various contextual factors may influence both implementation and outcomes. Understanding context is especially critical when the same program has varying levels of success across settings. We present a framework for evaluating contextual factors affecting an initiative at multiple phases of its life cycle, including design, implementation, scale-up, spread, and sustainability. After providing a brief overview of related frameworks from the fields of improvement science and implementation science and of the methods by which we drew from this literature to develop the current framework, we present how this framework was customized and applied to three national public health initiatives. We close with implications for how evaluators can apply the framework to facilitate a deeper understanding of a program's implementation and success, collaborate with project stakeholders, and facilitate sustainability, spread, and scale-up of public health initiatives.

AB  - Public participation plays a vital role in developing fast response services to support Jakarta Smart City's sustain- ability. This study explores and analyses public participa tion levels in utilising and developing these services, and their impact on urban sustainability. A qualitative case study approach was used, including in-depth interviews and document analysis. Findings reveal varying levels of public participation, influenced by accessibility, trust, and awareness. Active participants benefit more, while inactive ones experience service gaps. Public participation positively impacts service efficiency and quality of life, but barriers like low awareness, limited accessibility, and digital literacy persist. Efforts such as education, training, and improving IT infrastructure are essential to foster sustainable participation. In conclusion, public participation is key to Jakarta Smart City's sustainability, enhancing service efficiency, community involvement, and urban development. Continuous efforts are needed to manage and improve participation for long-term success.

AB  - Sustainability transitions need professionals with specific skills and attitudes that students often do not develop in their regular chemistry education. To foster sustainability change-maker competencies, we suggest augmenting higher education curricula, e.g., chemical degree programs, with transdisciplinary challenge-based learning combined with design thinking. The Da Vinci Project at Utrecht University (UU) in The Netherlands explores this approach, aiming to cultivate the undergraduates' sustainability change-maker competencies. After five years of experience, we reflected on the students' learning outcomes in this UU honors program. We conclude that transdisciplinary challenge-based education combined with design thinking provides unique opportunities for students to develop valuable skills and attitudes for navigating sustainability transitions, including the transition toward sustainable chemistry. These involve collaboration, communication, creative thinking, integrative problem-solving, stakeholder engagement, openness, empathy, the ability to deal with uncertainty and complexity, self-awareness, critical reflection, courage, and perseverance.

AB  - Energy systems modelling and design are a critical aspect of planning and development among researchers, electricity planners, infrastructure developers, utilities, decision-makers, and other relevant stakeholders. However, to achieve a sustainable energy supply, the energy planning approach needs to integrate some key dimensions. Importantly, these dimensions are necessary to guide the simulation and evaluation. It is against this backdrop that this paper focuses on the simulation and analysis approaches for sustainable planning, design, and development of microgrids based on clean energy resources. The paper first provides a comprehensive review of the existing simulation tools and approaches used for designing energy generation technologies. It then discusses and compares the traditional strategies and the emerging trends in energy systems simulation based on the software employed, the type of problem to be solved, input parameters provided, and the expected output. The paper introduces a practical simulation framework for sustainable energy planning, which is based on the social-technical-economic-environmental-policy (STEEP) model. The STEEP represents a holistic sustainability model that considers the key energy systems planning dimensions compared to the traditional techno-economic model used in several existing simulation tools and analyses. The paper provides insights into data-driven analysis and energy modelling software development applications.</p>

AB  - Community-based ecotourism enables community participation to achieve effective sustainable management while also fostering environmental well-being and community development. Fraser's Hill is a well-known ecotourism travel destination located in the Pahang state highlands in Malaysia. This study aims to examine the impact of development on the community's quality of life living in the vicinity of Fraser's Hill and contribute to the continuous move towards sustainable ecotourism. This study utilises the descriptive analysis approach to analysis to find the basic static value. A total of 60 respondents, including residents and guests in the area, were randomly chosen to collect data by the structured interview method. Positive and negative experiences were identified from an analysis of the expressive dimensions of the respondents. The study's findings demonstrate that several development accomplishments have decreased the fragile ecosystem to a specific degree. Moreover, there is an absence of community well-being in ecotourism exercises in the Fraser's Hill area. Most importantly, Fraser's Hill's development is appropriate; in any case, the community's understanding of the development is minimal. Holistic endeavours ought to be made for the community's well-being to share in the activities related to ecotourism in this highland location. This study will assist policymakers in three ways: to expand environmental understanding for sustainable development, to motivate the local community in community-based ecotourism, and to increase economic, social, and cultural benefits among inhabitants. These benefits encourage people in the community to get involved with community-based ecotourism, which helps both tourists and locals keep the environment safe and develop the local economy.

AB  - Background: The overlapping epidemiology of tuberculosis (TB) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections prompted the World Health Organisation in 2004 to recommend collaboration between national TB and HIV programmes. The goal of this collaboration is to decrease the burden of both infections in the population. This policy was subsequently adopted by the national TB and HIV programmes in Cameroon with TB and HIV nurses/counsellors acting as frontline implementers of the collaborative activities in the 10 regions of the country.
   Methods: Qualitative research interviews were conducted with 30 nurses/counsellors in four approved treatment centres providing comprehensive TB and HIV/AIDS services in the Northwest region of Cameroon. The aim was to explore their experiences in counselling, in delivering joint TB and HIV services, and the constraints to effective collaboration between TB and HIV services. To complement the findings from the counsellors' interviews, as part of an emergent design, further interviews with 2 traditional healers and non-participant observations in two HIV support group meetings were conducted.
   Results: According to the respondents, counselling was regarded as a call to serve humanity irrespective of the reasons for choosing the profession. In addition, the counselling training and supervision received, and the skills acquired, have altogether contributed to build patients' trust in the healthcare system. Teamwork among healthcare workers and other key stakeholders in the community involved in TB/HIV prevention and control was used as a strategy to improve joint service delivery and patients' uptake of services. Several constraints to effective collaboration between TB and HIV services were identified, including shortage of human resources, infrastructure and drug supplies, poor patients' adherence to treatment and the influence of traditional healers who relentlessly dissuade patients from seeking mainstream medical care.
   Conclusions: In order to achieve a sustainable collaboration between TB and HIV services, adequate planning, investment and strengthening of the health system including human resources, infrastructure and ensuring uninterrupted supplies of medicines are essential. A multidisciplinary approach to service delivery particularly focusing on harnessing the enormous potentials of traditional healers in TB/HIV prevention and control would also be indispensible.

AB  - Background: Urban freight transport has recently garnered significant attention from both professionals and academics due to its pivotal role in fostering economic and social development. Despite notable progress, this sector faces challenges that hinder its long-term sustainability. Addressing these issues and ensuring the lasting sustainability of urban freight transport require a thorough assessment and monitoring process utilizing specific indicators. Methods: This paper introduces a set of indicators developed using a three-step methodology aimed at assessing the sustainability progress of urban freight transport. Initially, we present a long list of indicators drawn from the existing literature. Subsequently, we consider five essential properties: achievability, data availability, predictability, relevance, and comprehensibility. Lastly, we apply a multi-criteria analysis methodology that utilizes these properties to assess the long lists encountered during the selection process. The chosen indicators are those that do not register a value of "0" for any of the specified properties. To enhance reliability, the indicators are collaboratively identified by a minimum of two experts. Results: By carefully selecting 18 indicators based on five sustainability dimensions (economic, environmental, social/societal, political, and spatial), our approach ensures a robust evaluation framework. Conclusions: These indicators serve as valuable tools for stakeholders in comprehensively evaluating the sustainability aspects of urban freight transport.

AB  - This paper attempts to 'connect the dots' between several cases and provide a comprehensive global analysis of the trend of universities reaching across campus boundaries to form partnerships with government, industry and civic organisations to drive an urban sustainability transformation. We refer to this emerging and possibly new academic function as 'co-creation for sustainability'. Our paper consists of three sections. In the first, we interpret this academic trend from a sociohistorical perspective based on previous social contributions of the university. Secondly, we conduct a macro-level empirical analysis based upon 27 partnerships from Asia, Europe, the Middle East and North America. Here we propose a framework for analysing and comparing key characteristics and commonalties across a large range of cases. We then supplement this with a micro-level study of two cases from Switzerland and the USA (2000 Watt Society Pilot Region Basel programme by Novatlantis and the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) domain and Rust to Green Utica by Cornell University). Here we examine closer the specific characteristics, processes, key outcomes and challenges encountered in each partnership. It is expected that this study can provide a valuable contribution to what is potentially a new area of academic research and a powerful way of advancing urban sustainability transformations.

AB  - Purpose To study the learning processes and mechanisms involved in sustainability-oriented supplier development (SSD), including how knowledge is transmitted by the buyer and how it is received, understood and internalised by the supplier. Design/methodology/approach An exploratory longitudinal multi-case study approach is adopted. The research context is a social SSD project focusing on occupational health and safety (OHS) management at four supplier factories. The paper draws on the constructs of absorptive capacity and boundary objects. Findings The development of a supplier's absorptive capacity for OHS management is triggered by the transfer of boundary objects that are created by the buyer. Findings suggest that each supplier starts explorative learning in a similar and passive way in order to accept the knowledge, but then each supplier proactively transforms and exploits the knowledge through continuous sensing, seizing, and reconfiguring loops that develop the boundary objects in a way that fits their own needs and contexts, incorporating the objects into organisational structures and routines. Research limitations/implications The research furthers the understanding of the development of supplier absorptive capacity for sustainability via SSD projects, including how it is triggered and sustained. The impact of ostensive and performative aspects of boundary objects on knowledge transfer is presented. Finally, insight is provided into how absorptive capacity and dynamic capabilities are linked in the context of SSD. Practical implications Buying firms should seek to develop boundary objects that can trigger and maintain learning momentum for sustainability at supplier organisations in addition to effectively transferring SSD-related sustainability knowledge. There is also a need to allow for sufficient flexibility in the design of the boundary objects, and to pay sufficient attention to how suppliers contextualise and embed them into their own organisations, providing support for this process where necessary. For the supplier, establishing structures and routines for OHS management can help to prepare for future audits, thereby reducing audit fatigue. Originality/value The paper contributes to the supply chain learning literature by exploring the development of supplier absorptive capacity for sustainability triggered by the focal buying firm. It sheds new light on the role of boundary objects for facilitating knowledge transfer and learning between supply chain members in the context of SSD projects.

AB  - Community-based tourism (CBT) has become a popular segment of sustainable tourism development worldwide to provide community welfare and empowerment. CBT has been pushed as one of the strategies for poverty alleviation, particularly in marginalized regions and communities. Thus, tourism has also experienced negative impacts creating a developmental conflict. This study proposes an integrated methodological approach that provides solutions for assessing tourism sustainability and advancing CBT development approaches and operations towards sustainability in rural communities in Hoi An, a heritage destination in Vietnam. The assessment is a combination of resident interviews, the fuzzy AHP approach, and the sustainability value of the Barometer of Sustainability. Retrieved from literature review, surveys and expert judgments, twenty-one indicators were selected to assess and evaluate the level of economic, socio-cultural, environmental, and management sustainability at a local scale. The final sustainability index reveals that CBT in Hoi An has overall potential sustainability. Economy, identified as the most critical criterion, ranked third in the sustainability level, while Culture-Society exceeded the potential sustainability score. Critical factors are community development policies, capacity building, full community participation and support, and environmental sustainability. The study contributes to the fragmented knowledge of assessing CBT sustainability and concludes that this is a reliable and feasible approach suggesting critical implications for sustainable development. It will appeal to policymakers, planners, and practitioners seeking more effective tools for planning and developing CBT.

AB  - Background: In many educational settings, professional development (PD) for in-service teachers assumes particular significance in the wake of curricula reform. This is so that teachers are enabled to become familiar with new competencies that are aligned with new learning standards, and also that teachers may be supported in actively reflecting on their practice. In recent years, some models of PD that incorporate the qualities of sustainability, collaboration and classroom-based research have gained popularity. Classroom-based research with teachers, however, is not always considered by teachers themselves to be an attractive or meaningful model for professional development. This is due to the notion that teachers may be hesitant to engage in research, because of reasons that include a lack of time, weak motivation, a sense that it is a low priority and the belief that research results are irrelevant to the immediate needs of the teaching and learning situation.
   Purpose: This study aimed to challenge this perception by supporting teachers to become empowered to participate in classroom-based research. It was conducted in the context of exploring what needs to be improved in response to recent curriculum reforms in the Philippines. The study set out to analyse the reflections of in-service teachers who considered the significance of their partnership with university science researchers in a year-long, research-based collaborative professional development activity. As the professional development activity was in its early stage of implementation, it was hoped that insights could be gained into the important factors of the activity, to support its development and design.
   Methods: In this qualitative study, teachers' reflections about their collaborative research-based PD with university researchers were categorised. Data were obtained from audio and video-taped transcripts, supplemented by formal interviews. Qualitative thematic analysis of conversations was strengthened by using the constant comparison method of Grounded Theory in order to formulate themes from the data transcripts.
   Findings: Results suggested that through collaboration, sustainability, trust and commitment, the teachers recognised the advantages of classroom-based research in the improvement of their instructional capacities. Through the analysis of the teacher reflections, the study yielded three major themes that are significant in the consideration of classroom-based research: (1) increased understanding of classroom dynamics; (2) shared ownership and involvement; and (3) reflective practice to connect and resolve ideas against prior beliefs. With the full involvement of the teachers, it appeared that the classroom research-based PD employed in this study helped to empower teachers and assisted in eliminating negative notions of research: the PD became, instead, an opportunity for immediate learning.

AB  - When projects are exclusionary, they are bound to fail because they are void of a collective sense of belonging and ownership. The government of Lesotho has been stridently pursuing renewable energy initiatives to augment the hamstrung monopoly provider and increasing user demand in energy provision. Based on content analysis, this study revealed that the government's troubles in managing grid and off-grid energy provision in the country result from its exclusionary technical-economic strategy that subverts citizen participation in decision-making. This study contends that power without a people is not a realistic option. This calls for an energy transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy in Lesotho. It proposes that operationalising energy democracy is not only transformative but also a sustainable future. Widening civic space in the energy sector and adopting a participatory approach will likely transform the status quo by creating jobs and ensuring environmental justice.

AB  - Tourism is one of the fastest-growing economic sectors in the world. However, the development of tourism in various regions does not necessarily guarantee the welfare of the local community of the tourist destinations. Moreover, there is an inevitable correlation between the rapid growth of tourism and large-scale negative impacts. In promoting sustainable tourism development, national and local government need to pay attention to environmental and cultural preservation. There is also a need to prioritize the interests of local communities to foster a sustainable community-based tourism (CBT). This study analyzes the question of community participation in realizing sustainable CBT in Karimunjawa, an archipelago of 27 islands in the Java Sea. Primary and secondary data were collected with snowball sampling selection techniques, using participatory observation, interviews, and documentation. Data analysis was conducted using the interactive analysis method of data reduction, data presentation, and drawing conclusions. The results show that the typology of community participation in realizing sustainable CBT in Karimunjawa can be classified as the Spontaneous-Induced Participation type-seen from the planning, implementation, and supervision stages. The participation of the Karimunjawa community is the result of the interaction between spontaneous and induced participation. In some of its dimensions, participation is active and bottom-up, while, in others, participation is still top-down and passive. In this respect, we argue that sustainable tourism development will succeed only if spontaneous participation is enhanced. Since the research is limited to the Karimunjawa area, its results cannot be generalized to others. Any further studies need to conduct research on broader or different areas, so that a wider range of similarities and differences can be revealed and analyzed. In this way, it should be possible to identify the characteristics of successful community participation for sustainable tourism development.

AB  - Integrating the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) into higher education programs, rather than treating them as add-ons, is essential for fostering genuine engagement with sustainability and driving transformational change across industries. However, evaluating whether the SDGs are meaningfully integrated into a program-and validating this integration-remains a challenge. This article presents an approach to authenticate the integration of the SDGs into higher education fashion curricula, using the Bachelor of Fashion and Textiles (Sustainable Innovation) at RMIT University, Australia, as the case study. Through cooperative inquiry, we employed a multi-level mapping approach to validate the SDG integration. This included a university-wide SDG mapping process using Elsevier's SDG keyword approach, program-level analysis, and a course-specific evaluation based on staff self-assessments. Our findings revealed differences in what the University high-level mapping identified, compared to the program staff self-assessments. This provided a two-way validation for both the SDG mapping exercise and the curriculum. It also became a useful reflective tool for program staff, as it highlighted how courses within a program are interconnected through the SDGs. The approach is not only applicable within fashion education but could be applied to other programs and disciplinary contexts to authenticate SDGs integration and to support ongoing curriculum development.

AB  - Arriving at shared mental models among multiple stakeholder groups can be crucial for successful management of contested social-ecological systems (SES). Academia can help by first eliciting stakeholders' initial, often tacit, beliefs about a SES, and representing them in useful ways. We demonstrate a new recombination of techniques for this purpose, focusing specifically on tacit beliefs about food webs. Our approach combines freelisting and sorting techniques, salience analysis, and ultimately network analysis, to produce accessible visualizations of aggregate mental models that can then be used to facilitate discussion or generate further hypotheses about cognitive drivers of conflict. The case study we draw upon to demonstrate this technique is Clayoquot Sound UNESCO Biosphere Reserve, on the west coast of British Columbia, Canada. There, an immanent upsurge in the sea otter (Enhydra lutris) population, which competes with humans for shellfish, has produced tension among government managers, and both First Nations and non-First Nations residents. Our approach helps explain this tension by visually highlighting which trophic relationships appear most cognitively salient among the lay public. We also include speculative representations of models held by managers, and pairs of contrasting demographic subgroups, to further demonstrate potential uses of the method.

AB  - Purpose: This study analyzes how supply chain leadership (SCL), supply chain followership (SCF) and green supply chain integration (GSCI) can contribute to green new product development (GNPD) and performance (PRF) through the effects of green innovation (GRI), considering the moderator role of customer pressure (CPR). In doing so, it provides new insights that can aid in understanding the importance of collaborative behavior in the supply chain that promotes sustainable benefits for companies and their stakeholders, stimulating green innovation as a key to making business more circular. Method: ology: Using a structured questionnaire, this study gathers data from a cross-sectional sample of 425 supply chain partners of Portugal's biggest energy supplier. Structural equation modelling is used to test the proposed hypotheses, and the impact of customer pressure on the suggested relationships is assessed through a multi-group analysis. Findings: The findings suggest that SCL, SCF and GSCI positively impact GRI. Additionally, this study reveals that GNPD has a positive impact on PRF. Supply chain customer pressure appears to moderate some of the proposed relationships. Implications/originality: This article provides some empirical evidence of the influence of SCL, SCF and GSCI on organizational value creation, contributing to a better understanding of the impacts of green innovation approaches on business sustainability. The overall results may support the importance of collaborative behavior in the supply chain for creating value for business, responding at the same time to the environmental sustainability challenges that humanity is facing, considering the role of customer pressure in moderating these relationships. Results show that, by being greener, a company may be more competitive, thus highlighting the importance of the collaboration between responsible and committed leaders and proactive followers for creating a better future for all. Limitations: The research considered the suppliers of only one company. The relationships between variables need to be explored in other practical case studies and longitudinal research to improve the potential for extrapolating generalizations and establishing clear causalities.

AB  - The Anthropocene is characterized by rapid global change, necessitating adaptive governance. But how can such adaptive governance be operationalized? The article offers a three-point argument to approach this question. First, people and environment need to be considered together, as social (human) and ecological (biophysical) subsystems are linked by mutual feedbacks, and are interdependent and co-evolutionary. These integrated systems of humans and environment (social-ecological systems) provide an appropriate unit of analysis. Second, the resilience approach deals with change in multilevel complex systems, and has stimulated much of the adaptive governance literature by addressing uncertainty and adaptation to unforeseen future changes. Third, there is a need to foster collaborative approaches to improve social and institutional learning, as for example in adaptive management, collaborative learning networks, and knowledge co-production. Collaborative learning is perhaps where further research, experimentation, and application might make a difference for operationalizing adaptive governance, with a focus on institutions, at all levels from local to international.

AB  - IntroductionChildren and families residing in regional Australia experience higher rates of vulnerabilities coupled with inadequate access to the early childhood health and early intervention services which pose increased risk to their health, development and wellbeing. The current study was designed to respond to the inherent complexity of supporting effective integrated service provision in regional communities, with a view to develop a model of effective service integration that leverages the capacity and opportunity of universal early childhood education (ECE) provision.MethodThe study adopted a qualitative multiple case study design to explore the perceptions of ECE professionals across six regional ECE services and two early intervention professionals operating from a regional early childhood intervention (ECI) organization. Data included an initial audit of the service system landscape coupled with facilitated discussions (focus groups and interviews) to identify facilitators and challenges to service integration and current patterns of service usage and engagement.ResultsFindings highlighted the foundational importance of relationships for establishing trust, engagement and service sustainability, as well as the need for embedding structural supports, including the professionalization of educators, the utilization of a key worker model, and staff retention. Systemic constraints, including limitations and inconsistencies in community infrastructure, program atrophy, and the complexity of referral systems, were seen to undermine effective service integration.DiscussionFindings speak to the potentiality of the ECE context as a hub for effective service integration within a functional practice framework for ECE. We conclude by offering a suggested model to ensure service connections, and enhance professional capacity and sustainability.

AB  - The influx of Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development and the COP 21 has necessitated the need for a paradigm shift in traditional consumption and production to reflect a balance between environmental safety, social justice and profitability. The Ghanaian Petroleum Industry is predominately fossil fuel-based with higher level of carbon and methane emissions. Ensuing from the Stakeholders' and the Resource-Based View theories, this paper aims to develop a model to explain the relationship between sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) practices and sustainable performance (SP) by examining the extent to which pressure from stakeholders could strengthen the proposed model in the context of downstream petroleum supply chain. Variance-Based Partial Least Square method has been used to analyse a cross-sectional data from Oil Marketing companies in Ghana. Our results have revealed that SSCM practices such as environmental, economic, and social are positively related to SP. Moreover, stakeholder's pressure positively and significantly relates to SP. Again, stakeholders' pressure significantly moderate the relationships between environmental and social dimensions of SSCM practices and SP. By implications, there is an emergency of an SP model with enhanced predictability. Again, policymakers and advocates can achieve greater sustainability by maximising stakeholders' pressure.

AB  - The circular economy (CE) is a multidisciplinary approach focused on achieving the sustainability of the whole society. This review aims to reveal the potential impact of the circular economy on quality of life. This systematic review analyzes studies dealing with the concept of circular economy and quality of life. The methodology process included a keyword search and three selection steps. A total of 39 studies were included in the analysis. We define four topics that emerged from the literature review i) urban sustainable development; ii) waste management; iii) material production and iv) human well-being. All these topics emerged in the literature dealing with issues of circular economy and its impact on the quality of life. We assume that it is implied that every step towards circular economy contributes to the life quality, but there is an evident lack of studies that measure that impact. In Serbia, a small number of researchers were involved in this topic, although it represents one step towards the objective of improving the state of the environment. This review of the literature should serve as a starting point for future research.

Design/methodology/approach A qualitative study was carried out, based on professors' experience, students' reports and registration data. Emergent themes were discussed based on the concepts of sustainability transitions, transdisciplinarity and active/experiential learning methods. Findings Undergraduate classes at the ecovillage have motivated students to work towards sustainability transitions by presenting them with new repertoires of sociotechnical configurations and social practices, by promoting a feeling of belonging and co-responsibility for the world and by a horizontal sharing of knowledge and affections that instigated reflections about their purposes in personal and professional life. Practical implications This experience demonstrates the potential of transdisciplinary pedagogical approaches to education for sustainability that promote collaboration with different stakeholders and the reflection on individual and collective motives and values - the inner dimension of sustainability. Originality/value It describes an innovative and transformative initiative in the heart of Latin America.

AB  - The intersection between sustainability and project management has received significant attention as organizations recognize the criticality of incorporating sustainability practices into their projects. However, incorporating sustainability considerations presents some challenges, requiring the development and adoption of methods, tools and techniques tailored to address sustainability at the project level. Against this backdrop, this study endeavors to develop an understanding of the effective incorporation of sustainability within projects through the micro-level perspective of practices. An online survey was developed based on a comprehensive literature review of which a total of 107 valid responses were collected and analyzed. The results show the most useful sustainable project management practices perceived by experienced project professionals, including 'Sustainability team management', 'Lessons learned towards sustainability' and 'Sustainability risk register', among others. However, a data analysis reveals a prevailing trend marked by the limited perceived usefulness of sustainability practices in the context of project management. Furthermore, through exploratory factor analysis, a clear classification of sustainable project management practices was identified, according to the specific phases of the common project management lifecycle: 'Initiation and planning', 'Execution, monitoring, controlling and replanning' and 'Closure'. By providing a set of sustainable project management practices and identifying the underlying factors that elucidate the incorporation of sustainable project management practices across the project management lifecycle, this study extends a guiding hand to practitioners in pursuing successful sustainability integration in their projects. It vividly illustrates that sustainability can be readily incorporated into project-management processes, delivering sustainable products and/or services in a sustainable way, combining both the 'sustainability of the project' and 'sustainability by the project' perspectives.

AB  - Purpose - Delivery of sustainability-related curriculum to undergraduate students can be problematic due to the traditional "siloing" of curriculum by faculties along disciplinary lines. In addition, while there is often a ready availability of courses focused on sustainability issues in the later years of students' programs, few early entry-level courses focused on sustainability, broad enough to apply to all disciplines, are available to students in the first year of their program.
   Design/methodology/approach - In this paper, we describe the development, and preliminary implementation, of an entry-level, interdisciplinary sustainability course. To do so, the authors describe the development of a university-wide initiative designed to bridge units on campus working and teaching in sustainability areas, and to promote and support sustainability curriculum development.
   Findings - The authors describe the conceptual framework for organising course content and delivery. The authors conclude with an informal assessment of the successes and challenges, and offer learning activities, student assessments and course administration recommendations for consideration when developing courses with similar learning goals.
   Originality/value - The positive and negative experiences gained through developing and offering a course of this nature, in a large research-focused university, offers knew insights into potential barriers for implementing first-year cross-cutting sustainability curriculum.

AB  - This paper explores the development and implementation of strategies for sustainable mobility in Basel, Switzerland. Basel (Bale, Basilea, Basle) has been identified as a 'relatively successful' practitioner of sustainable mobility, with an urban form that is not only conducive to walking and cycling, but also has an extensive public transport system and high levels of commuting using these sustainable modes of transport. With a low share of journeys by motor vehicles compared to many other European cities - combined with a legally-binding objective to reduce vehicle traffic by a further 10% from 2010 to 2020 Basel appears to be a forerunner with regard to sustainable mobility policy and practice. Five years after this objective was passed into law - following a public vote, as Basel is part of the Swiss confederation and practices direct democracy - this study aims to assess the extent of policy implementation and reflect on challenges and opportunities for the future. The paper presents findings from a series of interviews with stakeholders in Basel on the theme of sustainable mobility. Key questions include: is it possible to develop coherent strategies and policies to further reduce the role of motor vehicles and in doing so, achieve a modal shift? How does participation in a direct democracy influence strategy and policy development and outcomes? Do compromises and trade-offs mean strategies and policies promoting sustainable mobility are, like Swiss cheese, riddled with holes? By illustrating challenges and opportunities when advancing sustainable mobility in a participative culture, the study provides insights for policymakers and researchers in other contexts. Among the conclusions is an emphasis on the importance of committed individuals capable of expanding the 'strategy space' of processes. Participation provides one such opportunity, yet may also generate divergent or contradictory trends causing incrementalism. A rapid transition to sustainable mobility is thus likely to require increased politicisation of the topic by both politicians and civil servants.

T2  - KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING REVIEW
LA  - English
KW  - FRAMEWORK
AB  - Agile software development (ASD) has emerged as a result of consolidated values proposed under the lightweight methods of software engineering. Despite bearing some criticisms, the initial deployment and results observed in the practice environment represents its increasing domination over the traditional software development practices. Any ASD method, in particular, requires knowledge-intensive practices and typically employs multi-disciplinary expert team working extended periods of time for weeks on a nearly continuous basis. A huge amount of tacit knowledge creation and exchange happens in the entire process over the project lifecycle, which attracts the attention of research in the domain of knowledge management (KM). In this paper, first, we have mapped the agile values and agile principles, and in its support, we have argued upon and the need for integrated KM infrastructure and proposed a KM model that can be employed within the organization. We have also developed a conceptual framework for knowledge sharing and learning for the individual practitioners for the sustainability of agile team. We attempt to create an organizational learning framework for knowledge creation and exchange among the involved entities in a collaborative practice environment.

AB  - Sustainable watershed management requires effective stakeholder engagement and knowledge co-production. Currently, most methods for stakeholder engagement and knowledge co-production in the field are case-specific, applied in an ad hoc manner, and not tested across various spatial scales or water management con-texts. Moreover, these methods are not often evaluated, limiting our ability to learn from and adapt them. We critically assess the Freshwater Health Index (FHI), an indicator-based platform for stakeholder engagement and knowledge co-production, which has been applied in a variety of social-ecological systems. Using an ex-post analysis, we examined nine FHI case studies against an evaluative framework based on Talley et al.'s. (2016) five pillars for effective stakeholder engagement and Norstro center dot m et al.'s. (2020) four principles for knowledge co-production, from which we derived six principles (Context-based, Clear objectives/Goal-oriented, Systematic representation/Pluralistic, Use relevant methods, Create opportunities for co-ownership, Interactive/Reflective). We first identified activities in the FHI process that aligned with the six principles, then used narrative de-scriptions and guiding questions to evaluate individual case studies. Although we demonstrate that the FHI supports stakeholder engagement and knowledge co-production in a variety of contexts, the FHI process seldom fulfilled all six principles due to differences in watersheds. Key takeaways include the importance of aligning projects with existing water management schemes, and the need to establish a sustainability plan that empowers stakeholders to stay engaged beyond a single project timeline. Our evaluative framework can serve as a checklist in both the design and monitoring of place-based sustainability research projects more generally.

AB  - Although the policy performance field acknowledges the importance of adopting a long-term decision making perspective to attain more sustainable policy outcomes, it overlooks the way in which sustainable governance conditions and policy performance relate to each other. We address this gap by investigating why some countries succeed in terms of policy performance while others do not. Applying a fuzzy-set QCA to 41 Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development and European Union countries of the Sustainable Governance Indicators data, we find out that successful economic and social policy performance is mainly driven by executive accountability conditions combined with effective implementation, while the high-quality of media plays a key role in successful environmental policy performance. Considering the multiple paths that practitioners can follow toward sustainable development benefits, they can also learn how to shift from short-term to long-term thinking by identifying "what works and why," formulating good practices and guidelines for better policy performance in the respective national contexts.

AB  - Since independence, Timor-Leste has taken initiatives to improve adult literacy and successive governments, international NGOs and donor agencies have been involved in literacy programmes. This paper explores the non-formal literacy programmes with a particular focus on the Second Chance Education Project (SCEP), an accelerated learning model that helps improve literacy and numeracy, integrating academic and life skills through tailored support. SCEP was funded and supported by the World Bank and UNESCO in the initial stages, and implemented by the Ministry of Education that continues to run the programme through community learning centres established in eight municipalities. It analyses SCEP and the public policy framework, and scans through commitments made by the government to improve adult literacy. This paper examines the impact of SCEP employing a mixed-methods approach; examining public policies and literature on adult learning, incorporating the views of various stakeholders to assess the impact and sustainability of the programmes. It concludes that programme and policy level structural limitations hinder efforts to improve literacy among adults; this needs to be addressed to achieve the goals set in the national education plan.

AB  - With increasing market competition and environmental awareness, the freight transport industry has become under ever-increasing pressure to achieve better sustainability. Through horizontal transport collaboration (HTC), companies can consolidate their freight into fewer numbers of trucks, leading to cost and environmental savings. Therefore, HTC has been considered a promising strategy to boost the sustainability of freight transport. However, the successful applications of HTC are hampered by multiple barriers. This study contributes to the literature by identifying and prioritizing these barriers through integrating the fuzzy Delphi method (FDM) and the analytical hierarchy process (AHP). Firstly, a holistic list of 30 barriers divided into five categories is identified using literature review. Secondly, FDM is used to reach a consensus of experts' opinions regarding the important barriers that warrant undergoing the assessment process by AHP. Thirdly, AHP is used to identify the priority rankings of the five barrier categories and their associated barriers. Finally, the proposed approach is used to examine the critical HTC barriers in a case study from Denmark.

AB  - Societal and policy trends are leading to major demands on food systems, including a transformation towards more sustainable and resilient farming systems. Research is increasingly highlighting the importance of considering the landscape scale in such transformations, with the understanding that such an approach will require agricultural landscape design informed through trans-disciplinary approaches. Despite a number of sustainability transformations advocated in the scientific literature, there may, however, be very different views amongst actors of the food chain, from producers to consumers, over what such a transformed landscape should look like, leading to potential social conflicts and lack of progress towards transformative change. This has led authors to suggest a need to understand better the visions of a transformed agriculture from the perspectives of food system actors, including rural communities and farmers. This paper contributes to this debate by analysing stakeholder visions based on a case study in Bourgogne Franche-Comte ' (France) with three study sites involving: agriculture and water management near Auxerre, apiculture-agriculture in the Jura, and viticulture near Macon. Using the results of 55 interviews that included a 'miracle question' over what an ideal agriculture might look like, five ideal visions were identified: a recognised agriculture; a diverse agriculture; an anchored agriculture; a predictable agriculture; and a technological agriculture. Building on the differences and commonalities of the different visions, the results allow for the identification of areas of consensus, and also, where there are irrec-oncilable values and worldviews underpinning the views, how to address them. The process of visioning can be an important approach to promote greater understanding of different stakeholders' visions and transformation towards greater sustainability, especially when the resulting visions become the starting point of participatory processes and outcomes at the landscape scale.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to develop a framework and propositions to advance research and practice in sustainable supply chain management (SSCM). Performance indicators (economic, environmental, and social) identified in the paper aim to facilitate empirical testing of a range of theoretical models derived or extended from the stated propositions.
   Design/methodology/approach - The study of SSCM is truly complicated, and there is no one theory that applies in all instances. The authors analyzed over 200 critical articles published inmajor supply chain management and sustainability-based journals and grounded the proposed framework in a multi-theoretical perspective.
   Findings - SSCM implementation entails linking stakeholder pressures, moral motives, and management commitment with relational practices. The paper further elucidates how relational practices, when bundled together, can create a set of relational capabilities, which in turn transform stakeholder pressures into sustainable outcomes.
   Research limitations/implications - The research framework contributes to SSCM theory building insofar as it can be expanded into various theoretical models, allowing researchers to empirically test the links among SSCM drivers, management commitment, and relational capabilities, along with their individual or collective impact on supply chain performance.
   Practical implications - The framework provides a roadmap for firms to develop and nurture relational capabilities while dealing with growing stakeholder pressures. Moral motives strengthen top management commitment, which helps channel stakeholder pressures toward the proactive development of relational capabilities.
   Originality/value - The paper fulfills a call for utilizing multiple theoretical lenses to examine complex SSCM phenomena and, ultimately, to create a coherent theory of SSCM.

AB  - Studies on the adoption of sustainable consumption patterns have shown that citizen participation in the development of new products, services and systems, such as eco-towns, can, among other things, increase the legitimization, market acceptance and sustainability impact. Cooperatives that traditionally act on behalf of and work very closely with their members may be particularly well-suited to leading participatory development processes. By exploring the cooperative-led development of a new sustainable neighborhood in Switzerland, we analyze how citizens participated in different phases of the development process and the extent to which cooperative characteristics influenced this participation. We find empirical evidence that cooperatives and cooperative networks are a promising organizational form for involving citizens in all phases of the development process of new sustainable neighborhoods. Our findings add new insights to the literature of sustainability transitions by highlighting the cooperative network as a powerful actor for promoting participation in sustainable urban development, inducing learning processes beyond the boundaries of the newly developed neighborhood.

AB  - Transformations to sustainability for addressing climate change are now more urgent than ever. This paper argues that such transformations are firstly required in modernist practices that militate against sustainability due to their constitution by the fallacy of human control. The latter points to the conceit of suppressing uncertainties in knowledge, commandeering agency from above', standardising governance, harming marginalised ecologies and disqualifying practices inferiorised as primitive', irrational' or vernacular'. Undoing the fallacy of control,by admitting uncertainties,modernist practices may become caring through transformative engagement with others. I propose four aspects of such transformative engagement: (a) egalitarian commitment to distributing epistemological privilege; (b) ontological sensitivity, by taking seriously the relational bases of others' knowing; (c) learning for divergence from others; and (d) affinity in alterity across widening divergence. These aspects are proposed not as fully formed principles, but rather as questions to be reworked in ongoing encounters and struggles for sustainability and climate justice. The aim is to nurture other-than-modern understandings of climate challenges and to help build multiple coexisting pathways of resilience, adaptation and mitigation.

AB  - The concept of resilience is currently being widely promoted and applied by environmental and development organizations. However, their application of resilience often lacks theoretical backing and evaluation. This paper presents a novel cross-fertilization of two commonly used approaches for applying resilience thinking: the grassroots movement of Transition Towns and the Resilience Alliance's Resilience Assessment. We compared these approaches through a text analysis of their key handbooks and combined them in a series of participatory workshops with a local partner active in the Transition Movement. Our results demonstrate that despite sharing a number of key features, these two approaches have complementary strengths and weaknesses. Strengths of the Transition Movement include its motivating overarching narrative of the need to transform in response to global sustainability challenges, as well as practical tools promoting learning and participation. The Resilience Assessment's conceptual framework and structured process generated context-specific understanding of resilience, but provided little guidance on navigating transformation processes. Combining the Resilience Assessment's theory on complex systems with the Transition Movement's methods for learning also generated synergies in fostering complexity thinking. Based on these findings, we believe that integrating strengths from both approaches could be widely useful for practitioners seeking to apply resilience for sustainable development. Our study also highlights that methods for assessing resilience can be improved by combining insights from science and practice.

AB  - Capacity building is defined as a process by which stakeholders increase their knowledge, skills and resources in order to improve their ability to adapt in a fast-changing world. Universities play a key role in the promotion of sustainability and implementation of the 2030 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through capacity building. However, universities in developing countries face significant challenges in the implementation of capacity building programmes for sustainability given the lack of procedures that facilitate the systematic integration of multiple stakeholders epistemologies, methodologies and objectives. In this paper, we present a capacity building approach as a problem-focused process that follows a multi-domain/multi-stakeholder scheme, and provides alignment with the functions and responsibilities of different sectors of society. The approach involves the use of a decision-support tool for sustainability that enables stakeholders to actively participate in decision-making processes. We illustrate the implementation of the capacity building approach through two case studies and show how general and specific capacities tailored to the different stakeholders can be developed. Our approach to capacity building accentuates the role of universities in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean as research and innovation hubs that could help design and implement flexible, transparent and robust strategies towards achievement of sustainability in the region. Key policy insights Capacity building to address the sustainable development goals should aim to develop sets of interlinked capacities for sustainability across stakeholder groups. Capacity building should take into account the regional institutional contexts in which universities in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean are embedded. Effective implementation of capacity building must be tailored to the different roles and functions of the actors involved. Thematic, technical, evaluative and procedural domains provide a comprehensive framework to build capacities, which can be continuously adapted according to the functions and responsibilities of the actors. Capacity building approaches to address climate change vulnerability require decision-support tools to inform policy-making.

AB  - Sustainability research has increasingly progressed to incorporate economic, environmental and social aspects of business. While firms are inherently competing with each other in logistics distribution, this study investigates whether coopetition strategy (i.e. cooperate and compete) can lead to achieving the sustainability. Using a cross-sectional sample of newspaper supply chain partners including transporters and newsagents in Thailand, the results of structural equation modelling path analysis suggest that managers strongly believe in coopetitive approach to achieve sustainable logistics distribution resulting in significant economic, social and environmental improvement. The findings help managers to understand that firms that perceive to collaborate with competitors in a horizontal relationship can achieve sustainable logistic distribution.

AB  - This paper presents a retrospective synthesis and a prospective exploration of an intact line of inquiry that was inspired by the scholarly work of our mentor Bela H. Banathy. The inquiry centers on the creation of the conditions for the conscious evolution of humanity in partnership with earth. Initially, it focused on the notion of Evolutionary Learning Community (ELC) as the vehicle of choice for the creation of a 'Design Culture' that would promote learning, collaboration, innovation, and sustainability across different sectors of society. ELC serves to empower various forms of community to engage in self-directed sustainable development. It does so by fostering attention to a systemic variety of dimensions that assure wholeness and interconnections at both individual and collective levels of development for present and future generations. Application of the ELC framework in diverse contexts-such as business corporations, non-profit organizations, and civil society-naturally leads to consideration of the synergy and interrelations that arise in the evolutionary transformations that occur in different settings. Therefore, the inquiry has expanded to embrace issues of Evolutionary Development-that is, inquiry on ELC and other initiatives that support, facilitate, catalyze, and enhance self-organization for the creation of global sustainable learning societies. This paper articulates the relation between learning and development from a systemic and evolutionary perspective. Conscious evolution is defined and explored in the context of the evolution of education, business, and society. The paper ends with a description of the implications of this line of inquiry for further research and action. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Transitioning to renewable energy is an urgent global goal. Wind energy is a promising renewable source with contentious obstacles. Using the Yatir Wind Farm project in Israel as a case study, we explore the potential of framing in identifying and mitigating obstacles in a wind farm project. The cognitive and strategic frames employed by stakeholders were elicited through 18 semi-structured interviews and more than 100 documents. This analysis highlights three conflicting issues: potential or perceived harm to neighboring residents, protecting birds and bats, and adapting to changing regulations throughout the process. Regarding residents' opposition to feared harm from the project, initial cautious curiosity was followed by distrust and deep disappointment due to a lack of transparency and a sense of abandonment facing perceived existential threats to their health and homes. This led residents to conduct legal battles, which resulted in their claims being rejected. It also led to the breakdown of relationships among neighbors opposing and promoting the wind farms. In the case of bird and bat protection, stakeholders initially framed concerns emotionally until the dialogue shifted to scientific discourse, resulting in the successful refinement of mutually agreed upon regulatory guidelines. The structural appeal mechanisms effectively addressed evolving regulations, overcoming the lack of mutual understanding and resulting in the adoption of the majority of the new regulatory requirements. The analysis underscores the importance of understanding stakeholders' frames for effectively working through the complex and transdisciplinary nature of sustainability transitions and achieving successful outcomes. It also reveals the need for formal mechanisms to validate stakeholder needs and integrate them into decision-making processes. Recommendations include early and meaningful public involvement, process improvement for stakeholder engagement, and enhanced transparency in decision-making processes.

AB  - Access to energy is linked to poverty reduction and economic growth. However, electricity access rates in Africa have been very low despite recording progressive declines of people without access over the past decade. To achieve SDG 7, there is a need to provide electricity to people without access, the majority of whom live in Africa. Prepaid metering, being implemented in many African countries, is anticipated as a system to enhance electricity access and to ensure revenue is recovered successfully. In spite of the rapid urbanisation rate on the continent, there has been lack of research focus on electricity access in urban poor communities. The paper critically expands the simple binary measure that narrowly scrutinises urban poor communities' connection to the electricity grid or not by providing a framework to address and define energy access. It further examines residential prepaid electricity access in the urban context and more importantly, it does so in the advent of the geopolitical and economic crisis resulting from the COVID19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war. Using qualitative data from 85 interviewees in Kumasi-Ghana, findings show that although households are connected to the national electricity grid, reliability, adequacy, availability and affordability remain obstacles preventing utilisation, meaning households resort to alternative fuel sources that are generally regarded as environmentally damaging and harmful. It is envisioned that the findings would be pertinent for policy makers and stakeholders working to achieve Sustainable Development Goals related to improving the lives of the urban poor (SDG 7 and 11).

AB  - The combination of building information modeling (BIM) and integrated project delivery (IPD) has been widely supported in the literature as a solution to the problems of limited collaboration in the construction industry. BIM and IPD have been described as cooperative means of achieving sustainable benefit to stakeholders. However, most studies focused on the technological challenges involved, with reference mainly to the sustainable economic and environmental benefits of the combination, while the sustainable sociocultural benefits have not been extensively explored. In this study, these issues are addressed by highlighting the importance of implementing BIM as a social system, using BIM corporate social responsibility (CSR) application model, in a BIM-based IPD project. This CSR model of BIM application (CSR-BIM model) serves as a benchmark for examining the achievement of a sociocultural benefits from the project. Social network analysis (SNA) was employed as an analytical method for examining the inter-organizational communication network during the design stage in relation to the CSR-BIM model. The SNA studies were conducted to compare the optimal model findings and the actual findings, focusing on clusters, ego-network clusters and the centrality of the players. The comparison-which related only to the BIM communication platform, in the context of the professionals-found a distinction between the BIM manager and the project team and its management, presenting separate and partial clusters. The evaluation also identified the low centrality of the BIM manager relative to the optimal option. In response, recommendations are made to implement the CSR-BIM model as a management measure to better support a sustainable sociocultural project.

AB  - Despite the great progress made in ES (ecosystem service) science, the integration of ES into spatial planning remains below expectations. The science-policy/practice gap in ES application impedes the transformation to-ward sustainable spatial planning. In this review, we draw on the perspective from the science-policy interface to examine the use of ES knowledge in spatial planning. From the science perspective, we find that the usability of ES science has improved in recent years, although the evidence base used in planning remains incomplete; from the policy perspective, there is a lack of research on the way policymakers demand knowledge and their logic of action. Issues of power and politics are under-explored; given that the ES community advocates knowledge co-production as a significant merit of the ES approach, this is both surprising and worrying because of the multiple risks inherent in participatory processes. ES research should attend to these aspects to realize greater integration and policy effects in spatial planning.

AB  - Freight carriers, receivers and citizens in the inner-city area suffer the most from issues impacting last mile delivery due to exacerbated traffic congestion, limited parking and unsustainable delivery vehicles. Freight consolidation policies offer a sustainable solution to address these problems. The freight vehicles used in the consolidated deliveries could play a significant role in the sustainability and success of these policies. This paper applies a multi-stakeholder decision support approach to evaluate the suitability and potential of various delivery fleet configurations in addressing the perspectives and requirements of all stakeholders involved in last mile delivery to perform the consolidated delivery in the inner-city area. The Multi-Actor Multi-Criteria Analysis (MAMCA) framework was utilised to assess and rank various delivery configurations involving a combination of eco-friendly delivery vans, trucks and cargobikes based on the objectives of the stakeholders. The weight allocation of the criteria was determined through the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (F-AHP) method using responses collected from key actors representing all stakeholder groups in Melbourne, Australia. The multi-stakeholder analysis, which was performed using the Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluation (PROMETHEE) method, suggested that the consolidated delivery should be performed using a combination of eco-friendly delivery vans and cargobikes to incorporate the concerns of the societal stakeholders and operational requirements of the business stakeholders. The mono-actor analysis revealed the heterogeneity of the stakeholders' preferences and clashing views regarding the optimal delivery fleet. This highlights the importance of incorporating a multi-stakeholder perspective in the planning and selection of suitable urban freight policies. Accordingly, a suitable implementation plan for the consolidated delivery fleet was proposed to reflect the perspectives and requirements of these stakeholders.

AB  - Floodplains are unique environments that provide a dynamic link between terrestrial and aquatic systems. Intensification of human activity - particularly agriculture and urbanisation - has resulted in the degradation of floodplains worldwide. Restoration and sustainable management of floodplains requires holistic assessment and compromise between stakeholders to successfully balance environmental, economic, and social benefits. Yet, understanding these complex systems sufficiently to provide evidence-based recommendations is a challenge. We present the lessons learned from establishing an interdisciplinary research-based framework on the agricultural floodplain of Lake Saint Pierre, Que<acute accent>bec, Canada, whose mandate was to a) understand and define key environmental, agricultural, and socioeconomic attributes of the landscape, b) quantify the trade-offs and synergies between these attributes across different agricultural practices, regions, and land uses, and c) explore novel agrienvironmental management practices to assess their role in sustainable floodplain management. Within this manuscript, we explore the benefits that such an approach offers in evaluating sustainable floodplain land use. We found that an interdisciplinary research-based approach demonstrated important benefits such as knowledge transfer, more efficient use of resources (e.g., personnel, funding), and a flexible yet robust research framework. A framework of individual research projects connected to broader interdisciplinary themes allowed a more holistic synthesis of the floodplain systems and assessment of agri-environmental practices. By implicitly considering spatial and social scales, we conceptualised not just how redistribution of the land use types can meet sustainable management objectives, but also explored how compromises within existing uses can optimise socioeconomic, agricultural and environmental dimensions and move towards a sustainable multifunctional landscape.

AB  - Higher education institutions must enable students to acquire skills and capacities that prepare them for working life and enhance their employability. This will lead to an applied learning- and teaching-enhancement-oriented sustainable Higher Education System. This research aims to contribute to that goal by analyzing student interactions in a collaborative learning community. It assesses the impact of visual tools on academic performance and student satisfaction in employment-focused blended studies, in which enrollees were geographically dispersed undergraduates with a diversity of profiles. A financial studies learning community was created to test students' interactions in a model conducive to participation as visual content creators and users. Three surveys (pre-project, appraisal of classmates' visual exercises, and post-project) were conducted to assess project impact. First, we used a univariate approach, focused on students' characteristics, course and project appraisals, and the effects of the project on academic performance and expectations. Secondly, a bivariate approach was conducted to detect relationships between respondents' appraisals and personal characteristics and to determine whether their mean scores were the same irrespective of such characteristics. The findings showed that: (1) Students' preferences concur with those of their employers; (2) participation in innovative initiatives improves students' perception of course procedures; (3) visual tools have a positive impact on learning, in terms of both academic performance and student satisfaction. The study concludes by providing support for educational institutions ' decision-making around courses and the overall curricula by defining the factors determining academic performance and student satisfaction.

AB  - The existing literature agrees that companies' sustainability concerns are related to stakeholders' sustainability awareness. However, these studies disagree on how this relationship occurs. Some suggest that companies strategically decide to be more sustainable, expecting that stakeholders' recognition of their efforts will generate competitive advantage (inside-out perspective). However, others suggest that companies' sustainability aware-ness (and actions) increases only in response to stakeholder requests (outside-in perspective). Each perspective offers different views on how much stakeholders should trust the available information sources about companies' sustainability performance-what companies say (e.g., sustainability reports) and what ESG ratings companies present-because obtaining direct information about what companies do may be difficult for external stake-holders. In exploring how these theories support each other, we suggest strong structuration theory as a helpful tool for integrating inside-out and outside-in perspectives. We argue that these perspectives are complementaries instead of opposites, propose a framework to approach empirical settings, and apply the said framework to analyze the Cerrado Manifesto case, a zero-deforestation initiative led by private organizations, mainly Euro-pean, on the Brazilian Cerrado biome. Using different information sources, we apply SmartPLS 4.0.9.2 to test the relationship between what companies say, do, and what ESG ratings say they do, additionally investigating the influence of social pressure, institutional environment, and controversies around companies. The results show no direct relationship between what ESG ratings say companies do and manifesto-signing (what companies do), but show an indirect effect through reporting (what companies say). A positive relationship was found between ESG rating and reporting, and between reporting and manifesto-signing. Significant relationships were found between the pressure received construct and both manifesto-signing and reporting. The proposed framework, integrating inside-out and outside-in perspectives, explains a company's manifesto-signing.

AB  - The proliferation of internal displacement is a socio-economic crisis in Africa that requires scrutiny of the livelihoods of the internally displaced. Despite acknowledging the vulnerabilities, poverty, and insecurity of internally displaced people reliant on humanitarian assistance, governments and other stakeholders have not taken concrete initiatives to remedy the situation. This study focuses on civil conflict-induced internal displacement and received funding from the UK's Global Challenges Research Fund to address an urgent socio-economic need in developing countries. The research interrogated viable livelihood options for internally displaced persons from Cameroon's ongoing Anglophone crisis. Anchored by a sustainable livelihood conceptual lens, the methodology utilised a predominantly qualitative research design to generate empirical data from local humanitarian agencies servicing internally displaced persons through semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions. Key findings reveal limited humanitarian assistance and numerous livelihood challenges facing the internally displaced, poor management of humanitarian funds by public agencies, ways to assist IDPs in achieving sustainable livelihoods, weak collaboration/coordination between the government and local humanitarian agencies to help displaced persons in sustaining their livelihoods, the assistance local humanitarian organisation needs to help displaced persons gain self-reliant livelihoods, broad support for viable livelihoods and suggestions on achieving them. This study provides evidence-based knowledge on durable livelihoods for internally displaced people and enhances academic literature and policy development on internal displacement. Insights from the findings inform recommendations that would mitigate the risk of permanently trapping displaced persons in a vicious cycle of destitution and food aid dependency and instead foster self-reliance during internal displacement.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is impacting all aspects of food systems, including production, food processing, distribution, and consumption. AI, if implemented ethically for sustainability, can enhance biodiversity, conserve water and energy resources, provide land-related services, power smart cities, and help mitigate climate change. However, there are significant issues in using AI to transition to sustainable food systems. AI's own carbon footprint could cancel out any sustainability benefits that it creates. Additionally, the technology could further entrench inequalities between and within countries, and bias against minorities or less powerful groups. This paper draws on findings from a study of the Victorian Farmers' Markets Association (VFMA) that investigated the complexity of designing AI tools to enhance sustainability and resilience for the benefit of the organisation and its members. Codesign workshops, both synchronous and asynchronous, semi-structured interviews, and design innovation methods led the VFMA to experiment with an AI tool to link sustainable soil practices, nutrient rich produce, and human health. The analysis shows that the codesign process and an agile approach created a co-learning environment where sustainability and ethical questions could be considered iteratively within transdisciplinary engagement. The bottom-up approach developed through this study supports organisations who want to engage with AI while reinforcing fairness, transparency, and sustainability.

AB  - Multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) provides a suitable platform for groups as well as promotion of the participants' role in decision processes. This also enables the development of real participatory processes essential for the successful implementation and sustainable flood management programs. The present study contributes by applying two MCDM approaches for weighting the criteria related to the environmental impacts of flooding. Moreover, an attempt was made in this study by an extensive review of literature, and consultations with experts to identify the environmental impacts of flooding in Odisha State (India). Then, the Best Worst Method (BWM) followed by the Step-Wise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis (SWARA) method was used to rank the environmental impacts which were considered as the risk factors. The result of this study will be useful to the governance system for an effective and proper planning, and implementation of flood mitigation projects.

AB  - Private sector collaboration for sustainable development remains a "black box" in terms of collaborative governance mechanisms: the specific arrangements or types of collaboration used by multiple actors to come together and implement and oversee rules to align their efforts towards shared goals. Therefore, a theoretical framework is needed to guide the design of collaborative efforts towards the achievement of UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). We address such a need, using a systematic literature review to conceptualize the main dimensions of collaborative governance (hierarchy, formalization, centralization), and the factors influencing the impact of collaborative governance choice on sustainable development outcomes. Our results highlight that there are different types of collaboration as a governance mechanism for progress towards Sustainable Development Goals and that alternative governance arrangements should be combined. We also found that the success of collaboration is contingent not only on governance-specific dimensions but also on the type of SDG and the type of partners involved. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Problem: For institutions to successfully implement a community-oriented/based education strategy, it is necessary to have full support from the community. Without such support, there may not be sufficient foundation to train students within the community, or to orient curricula to address community health needs and priority problems. Building mutual trust between communities and academia takes time and effort. Some educators think it is easy to "enter" the community and send students for training. Approach: It is essential to approach this education strategy with compassion and empathy. Careful planning and adequate time allocation are crucial to engage communities at different levels. Communities are often apprehensive, but they can be highly responsive when treated with respect and their requests given consideration. To ensure a successful engagement with local communities, it is imperative to consider their perspective and tailor the engagement process to suit their unique needs and expectations. Failure to do so may result in negative consequences, which could jeopardize the success of the initiative. Outcomes: This article outlines a staircase model for medical schools to effectively engage their local community and progress towards achieving community partnership followed by weaning. The model is innovative and aligns with the social accountability principles set forth by the World Health Organization. Building a strong community- university partnership requires careful planning and implementation of various components. Next Steps: By considering all factors, we can build a sustainable, collaborative partnership that benefits both the community and the university with tremendous relief from the burden on the local government.

AB  - Access to justice promotes the achievement of sustainable development as it promotes the participation of citizens of a country, reduces poverty, increases the productivity of persons and strengthens the peace and development of nations. In Nigeria, however, most women are deprived of justice in several ways. Using the doctrinal method of study, this article examines the concept of access to justice and its importance to the achievement of sustainable development in Nigeria. Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) five and 16 are discussed as well as the various ways in which women are deprived of justice and barriers to such access. The study discovers that women have limited access to justice as a result of challenges plaguing Nigeria's justice system. The study concludes that urgent steps must be taken to solve these challenges so that the SDGs will stand a better chance of being achieved by 2030.

This research is intended to explore changes and adjustments made in the curriculum of undergraduate entrepreneurship education programmes in selected higher education institutions in Australia due to uncertainties caused by COVID-19. We focused on six Australian universities offering undergraduate entrepreneurship programmes, which were purposefully chosen. Data and information were gathered from the universities' websites, documents available from the same source, the universities' structure of engagement activities, and their curriculum. Previous literature was referred to for models already proposed and executed. By considering the COVID-19 crisis as well as similar types of future uncertainties, the study has identified the necessity of implementing open innovation and experiential learning models in a blended environment and having strong IT infrastructure for sustainable industry-university collaboration to facilitate a learning culture and develop entrepreneurship skills in undergraduate entrepreneurship education learners in Australia.

AB  - The fashion industry generates packaging waste through the entire supply chain. Although brands are making efforts to improve packaging sustainability as demands for low-impact packaging are rising, there is a lack of empirical evidence of innovative packaging solutions among fashion retailers. This study represents the first global report on sustainable packaging innovation in the fashion sector. A data-mining approach was utilized to gather a sample of 400 international fashion brands that advertise sustainable packaging solutions across five continents. The sustainability of the packaging solution was evaluated for each brand based on three factors: sustainability mission, the availability of packaging data, and the actual sustainability of the package. The results showed that 57% of brands have made evident progress in the sustainable packaging area; 34% of brands have initiated the transition from conventional to improved packaging; the remaining brands have committed to rethink (1%) or to improve (8%) their packaging in the future. By providing comprehensive state-of-the-art evidence about practical achievements in the sustainable packaging field, this global report intends to help academics and practitioners to evaluate the environmental, social, and economic impacts of existing packaging products and to design circular packaging that minimizes these impacts.

AB  - Diversity is generally recognized as a key issue for learning in stakeholder dialogue on wicked sustainability issues. Yet the question on how design of stakeholder dialogue and supporting methods actually enhance learning in stakeholder dialogue deserves more attention. This paper presents constructive conflict as a central design issue for stakeholder dialogue. This means that a dialogue entails the articulation of a diversity of perspectives and the confrontation of claims and ideas based on these perspectives. Building on three properties of diversity (variety, balance and disparity), the methodological implications of constructive conflict as a central design issue will be derived. These implications are structured according to three design steps: stakeholder identification and selection, articulation of perspectives and confrontation of claims and ideas. It is argued that social scientific methods are needed to support design of stakeholder dialogue. Q methodology is presented as an example that was used in a stakeholder dialogue on sustainable biomass in the Netherlands to identify stakeholder perspectives, to select stakeholders and to structure the dialogue. The paper wraps up with conclusions on constructive conflict as a design issue.

AB  - Mobile health (mHealth) innovations are considered by governments as game changers toward more sustainable health systems. The existing literature focuses on the clinical aspects of mHealth but lacks an integrated framework on its sustainability. The foundational idea for this paper is to include disciplinary complementarities into a multi-dimensional vision to evaluate the non-clinical aspects of mHealth innovations. We performed a targeted literature review to find how the sustainability of mHealth innovations was appraised in each discipline. We found that each discipline considers a different outcome of interest and adopts different time horizons and perspectives for the evaluation. This article reflects on how the sustainability of mHealth innovation can be assessed at both the level of the device itself as well as the level of the health system. We identify some of the challenges ahead of researchers working on mobile health innovations in contributing to shaping a more sustainable health system.

AB  - Open education, Open Educational Practices (OEPs), and Open Educational Resources (OERs) have emerged as significant opportunities for enhancing global sustainability information sharing. However, the creation and sharing of OERs, as well as the usage of OEPs in Higher Education for Sustainable Development (HESD), remain limited. This study explores the implementation of OEPs in HESD, aiming to empower students to co-produce OERs on sustainable development (SD). This study, drawing on the theoretical approach of the principle of constructive alignment, proposes the development of students' digital competence in OER production. A two-group pretest-posttest analysis of 409 students (Psychology, Economics, Education, Geography) reveals a significant increase in digital competence over time among students who produced OERs on SD, compared to their peers enrolled in courses unrelated to OER content development. We delve into the practical implications of designing OEPs in HESD and strategize to support students in their OER production processes.

TI  - Healthcare in a carbon-constrained world
T2  - AUSTRALIAN HEALTH REVIEW
LA  - English
AB  - Objective The climate crisis necessitates urgent decarbonisation. The health sector must address its large carbon footprint. In the present study, we sought healthcare thought leaders' views about a future environmentally sustainable health system.
   Methods The present study was a qualitative exploratory study consisting of semistructured, in-depth interviews with 15 healthcare thought leaders from Australia, the UK, the US and New Zealand. Audio recordings of the interviews were transcribed and analysed by matrix display and thematic analysis.
   Results Overall, healthcare thought leaders believe that to reduce the carbon footprint of healthcare we need to look beyond traditional green' initiatives towards a more fundamental and longer-term redesign. Five main themes and one key enabler' (information communication technology) were identified. In this paper we draw on other relevant findings, but chiefly focus on the fifth theme about reshaping the role of healthcare within society and using the size and influence of the health sector to leverage wider health, environmental and societal benefits.
   Conclusions These ideas represent potentially low-carbon models of care. The next step would be to pilot and measure the outcomes (health, environmental, financial) of these models.
   What is known about the topic? The health sector needs to reduce its large carbon footprint. Traditional green' initiatives, such as recycling and improving energy efficiency, are insufficient to achieve the scale of decarbonisation required.
   What does this paper add? Healthcare thought leaders surveyed in the present study suggested that we also consider other, non-traditional ways to achieve environmental sustainability. In this paper we discuss their ideas about adopting an anticipatory approach to healthcare using predictive analytics, and using the size and influence of the health sector to effect wider health and environmental benefits.
   What are the implications for practitioners? Achieving an environmentally sustainable healthcare system is likely to require broad and fundamental (i.e. transformational) change to the current service model. Health practitioners throughout the sector must be closely engaged in this process.

AB  - Many sustainability challenges, such as contamination of air, water, and soil or climate change, can be traced back to specific polluting substances (e.g., mercury), technologies (e.g., combustion engines), or practices (e.g., waste dumping). To confront these grave challenges, "phase-out"is garnering increasing attention as a policy approach. Although the literature on phase-out is burgeoning, it remains unclear how the concept has evolved across scientific disciplines and policy. In this review, we use a coding-based mapping approach to systematically unpack the scientific discourse on phase-out since 1970, focusing on the contribution of different scientific disciplines, targets and drivers of phase-outs, instruments, affected industries, and geographical context. We find that the focus of phase-out has shifted from toxic pollution to climate change, and that the scope of phase-out targets has broadened. Results further suggest that phase-out is emerging as a bridging concept to foster transdisciplinary dialogues and transformative actions toward greater sustainability.

AB  - The circular economy aims to minimize waste by adhering to the principles of reduce, reuse and recycle, contrasting sharply with the traditional linear economy, which often generates significant waste and environmental harm. Viewing the circular economy through the lens of a business ecosystem offers valuable insights into how various components of circular economic activities interact through value exchanges. This perspective enables decision-makers and policymakers to enhance and expand the ecosystem effectively. This paper introduces a novel approach to mapping and organizing circular economic activities using business ecosystem modeling. Circular economic activities operate within a business ecosystem of interdependent organizations collaborating to achieve long-term sustainable value exchanges. The proposed model facilitates the visualization and organization of these interactions, enabling the cohesive expansion of circular economic practices. Transitioning from a linear to a circular framework establishes a paradigm for sustainable, collaborative and environmentally conscious economic practices. A key contribution of this paper is the introduction of the Value Exchange Network (VEN) framework, a novel business ecosystem modeling that can be used as a tool to design circular economic activities. The primary outcome is a circular business ecosystem model, accompanied by a diagram illustrating various circular economic activities within the ecosystem. The model's practical utility is demonstrated through real-world examples, showcasing its potential to effectively support the management and enhancement of circular economic activities.

AB  - Purpose
   Environmental sustainability and social contexts are becoming increasingly important concepts. The infusion of sustainability and humanitarian engineering (HE) into the academic core curriculum is often challenging. This study aims to provide an understanding of students' perceptions and attitudes toward the incorporation of active learning of sustainability and humanitarian concepts into engineering education.
   Design/methodology/approach
   A project-based sustainability course was developed and offered to engineering undergraduates. A HE international field experience was also provided to students as an extracurricular activity. Pre- and post-surveys were conducted to assess students' perceptions and attitudes toward sustainability and HE project learning experience. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to determine the statistical significance of the results and demographic influences on students' experiences.
   Findings
   Both project-based and international field learning experiences positively influenced the students' perceptions of sustainable practices, social change and appreciation of the engineering profession. Multidisciplinary learning also helped students become more motivated, engage in sustainability-promoted activities and community work and improve their social interactions. Students gained practical engineering skills that they did not typically receive in traditional classroom settings and recognized the global and social responsibilities that are core to sustainable development education.
   Originality/value
   The study demonstrates a mixed undergraduate educational model in which students acquired sustainability concepts through a project-based engineering course and practiced social responsibility through international HE projects. The findings help engineering educators understand students' perceptions toward sustainability and HE, providing insight into effective curriculum design and strategic inclusion of social responsibility in traditional engineering education.

AB  - After the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics, Chinese officials claimed that the goal of "driving 300 million people to participate in ice and snow sports" had been achieved. Historically, the London 2012 Olympic Games had a similar goal: to increase sports participation for all by hosting the Olympic Games. Given these goals, the impact of the Olympic Games on sports participation has clearly become significant. These impacts can be referred to as the Olympic sport participation legacy, an intangible Olympic legacy. The Olympic sport participation legacy has attracted a lot of researchers' interest in the academic field in recent years. This paper aims to conduct a scoping review of Olympic sport participation legacy studies between 2000 and 2021 to identify the progress of studies on the sustainability of Olympic sport participation legacies. Unlike previous scoping reviews on sport participation legacies, this review adopts a Patterns, Advances, Gaps, Evidence of Practice, and Research Recommendations (PAGER) framework at the results analysis stage to improve the quality of the findings. The results from the scoping review contained 54 peer-reviewed articles on three levels of research: the population level, social level, and intervention processes. Many studies indicate that achieving a sustainable Olympic sport participation legacy requires joint collaboration and long-term planning between governments, community organisations, and other stakeholders.

AB  - Background: Brown algae are a valuable source of various biopolymers, with alginate standing out as a phycocolloid of great industrial importance. Although the extraction process is well established on an industrial scale, several innovative and environmentally friendly extraction technologies have been explored to improve the efficiency of the process both in terms of yields and energy and solvent consumption. Scope and approach: The review aims to describe and analyze different strategies used to extract alginate from brown algae, including different pre-treatment methods used before extraction. In addition, the impact of these extraction technologies, with or without pre-treatments, on alginate's structural and techno-functional properties is also discussed. Key findings: The extraction process parameters play a key role and significantly influence the quality of alginate and the extraction yield. Innovative technologies have the potential to enhance extraction capacity, improve process efficiency, and promote environmental friendliness. Research efforts are focused on achieving sustainable alginate production and co-production of other value-added products. This review provides useful information to the alginate industry towards a more sustainable approach and foster the diversification of high-value products.

AB  - Although the theoretical-methodological complexity theory and transdisciplinary approach is increasingly accepted within sustainability science, its application at local-scale work with rural communities in the global south is still incipient and requires further research on its scope and limitations. The general objective of this work was to contribute to the knowledge on how a complexity and transdisciplinary approach applied to water problems at local scales can facilitate the process for water sustainability. The research took as study area the ejido of Coro Grande located in the municipality of Morelia, in the rural vicinity of Morelia City, capital of Michoac & aacute;n State (Mexico). The theoretical-methodological scheme was based on the combination of the concepts of complexity-sustainability-transdisciplinarity to analyze the local water metabolism and generate actions to mitigate present and future water risk. The activities carried out involved a participatory diagnosis and the development of activities for the restoration of degraded environments with a double purpose: to generate conditions for the water sustainability of the system, and to promote the involvement of the population in a transdisciplinary research-action process. The results obtained show the effectiveness of the framework chosen to identify problems, achieve transformation in the short term, and improve both ecosystem functions and participation of the population in the solution of problems in the medium and long terms.

AB  - With the rise of technology, the fashion industry has experienced a sharp drop in traditional channels, which has been intensified throughout the pandemic outbreak of the coronavirus. While many fashion companies have launched online channels, lack of motivation, awareness, and experience have created some concerns for consumers when it comes to online shopping. To address these issues and considering the importance of advertising investment, a model of dual-channel Closed-Loop supply chain has been formulated in this paper, which takes into account the "Bundling" strategy and cost-sharing advertising investment, by using the Stackelberg game, optimal decision-making variables for decentralized, centralized, and coordinated models have been obtained. To be more exact, the Stackelberg game is introduced between the manufacturer and the traditional retailer. Collaborative efforts among traditional retailer and manufacturer in remanufacturing and recycling waste products can help mitigate resource shortages and environmental crises, resulting in a more sustainable economy. Besides, the bundling strategy is the focal point in this paper, which has been applied to the online demand which encourages consumers to buy products, this strategy results in new demand functions including asymmetric online and offline demands. The online channel brings with it a multitude of benefits, including increased efficiency, reduced environmental impact, improved customer satisfaction, and increased brand loyalty. Additionally, it plays a crucial role in achieving the sustainable goals of the fashion industry. The sustainable development goals offer a comprehensive, far-reaching framework to tackle worldwide challenges, and this research tried to make significant progress in achieving several of these goals. Implementing revenue-sharing and cost-sharing contracts in both forward and reverse channels can help coordinate the supply chain and achieve maximum potential profit. With coordination contracts in place, the supply chain can work towards achieving the 17th Sustainable Development Goal, which is participation in achieving the goals. Results show that the bundling strategy is an efficient approach to increase the demand and the profit of the fashion clothes supply chain. Also, advertising in addition to bundling strategy and recycling and remanufacturing processes can improve the efficiency of the chains. Also, we find out the revenue-sharing contract can share the extra profit fairly and reasonably.

AB  - Realising the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) will require transformative changes at micro, meso and macro levels and across diverse geographies. Collaborative, transdisciplinary research has a role to play in documenting, understanding and contributing to such transformations. Previous work has investigated the role of this research in Europe and North America, however the dynamics of transdisciplinary research on 'transformations to sustainability' in other parts of the world are less well-understood. This paper reports on an international project that involved transdisciplinary research in six different hubs across the globe and was strategically designed to enable mutual learning and exchange. It draws on surveys, reports and research outputs to analyse the processes of transdisciplinary collaboration for sustainability that took place between 2015-2019. The paper illustrates how the project was structured in order to enable learning across disciplines, cultures and contexts and describes how it also provided for the negotiation of epistemological frameworks and different normative commitments between members across the network. To this end, it discusses lessons regarding the use of theoretical and methodological anchors, multi-loop learning and evaluating emergent change (including the difficulties encountered). It offers insights for the design and implementation of future international transdisciplinary collaborations that address locally-specific sustainability challenges within the universal framework of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

AB  - Sustainable development activities are comprised of complex sets of social, economic, and ecological factors. Cross-scale knowledge and applications are increasingly valuable today in achieving successful interdisciplinary action research collaborations among universities and other stakeholders in order to understand and manage the predictable and unpredictable transformative change possibilities in social-ecological systems.
   This paper analyzes case studies of two complex regional social-ecological systems that illustrate the dynamic interactions between human societies and natural systems. The framework of panarchy, which integrates the cross-scales and domains of social, economic, and environmental systems, is incorporated as a means of examining the dimensions of adaptability and resilience, and the evolution of these social-ecological systems as stakeholder learning networks. The practical intent of using case studies is threefold: 1. To demonstrate how a holistic synthesis of these multi-domain frameworks can enrich descriptive and prescriptive analyses of social-ecological systems phenomena, 2. To make these integrative frameworks and analytical tools more readily useful for students, university educators, researchers and academic-practitioners, to incorporate into interdisciplinary curricula, teaching, research and practice, and 3. To offer these cross-domain tools to facilitate integrative action research collaborative partnerships among educators, researchers, academic-practitioners, and other social-ecological system stakeholders.

AB  - Purpose This paper aims to report on a case study concerning the development of sustainable energy partnerships involving engineering faculty and undergraduate students at the University of Girona, Catalonia, Spain.
   Design/methodology/approach Faculty were motivated to seek partnerships with public and private entities in the local area for the purposes of realising mutually beneficial outcomes. The educational programmes of future engineers, when sustainability is considered, are analysed. Education for sustainable development has to include multidisciplinary active learning as a desirable competence. Active learning can be obtained when problems are based on real life because they are most motivating for students. Constructive alignment component is obtained because learning objectives are linked with learning activities related to the needs of public and private entities.
   Findings Through the provision of technical expertise, the adoption and success of renewable energy projects was facilitated on the one hand, while final year undergraduate students benefited in terms of hands-on experience in helping to bring these projects to life, drawing on the knowledge and skills they had acquired throughout their degree programmes. These works are addressed to students by faculty members with the aim of developing and promoting renewable energies. Outcomes from partnerships surpassed expectations; not only were different benefits realised as were initially hoped for, but this success led to partnerships being sustained over time.
   Originality/value Fossil fuel-based energy systems are associated with a myriad of negative environmental and social externalities. It is difficult to overstate the importance of transitioning towards alternative low carbon energy sources for climate change mitigation which are less centralised compared to the status-quo for energy security and energy independence. By actively facilitating the development of decentralised renewable energy sources in Catalonia, the projects reported herein are of significant value in social environmental and educational terms.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to report on the use of the soft systems methodology (SSM) to enhance the role of the higher education institution (HEI) stakeholder's action networks in achieving the sustainable development goals (SDGs). We review the literature on sustainable development in HEIs, in particular the role of stakeholder networks for the implementation of SDGs in HEI. We outline some of the features of SSM as an approach to help make sense of this complexity. CATWOE analysis, a conceptual SSM tool, is applied to a stakeholder's network hosted by a Brazilian university with the purpose of achieving the SDGs as part of the community projects (HEI external engagement). Findings of the systemic application suggest that the use of some elements of SSM helps clarify and make sense of the role of the stakeholders and assists in formalising action networks to achieve SDGs.

AB  - PurposeThis investigation highlights the discrepancies in sustainability reporting practices, and their implications for sustainable service.Design/methodology/approachA comparative analysis methodology was employed, examining sustainability reports from similarly situated companies, specifically PepsiCo and Coca-Cola and The Home Depot, Lowe's and HomePro. This approach was chosen to uncover variances in sustainability reporting and practices within these sectors using the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) guidelines which all four firms followed in their sustainability reports.FindingsThe study reveals significant disparities in how companies within the same industry apply SASB guidelines. These inconsistencies highlight a broader issue of non-standardization in sustainability reporting, leading to challenges in effectively evaluating the relative performance of companies in the same sector.Practical implicationsThe findings suggest managers must prioritize standardized and transparent sustainability reporting to build stakeholder acceptance and trust.Originality/valueThis paper contributes to the existing literature by providing a detailed comparison of sustainability practices in two distinct industry sectors. It offers new insights into the challenges and importance of standardizing sustainability reporting and the potential impact on stakeholders.

AB  - Animal recording is an interactive process that involves several practices. The efficiency of the process is essential to ensure the utility of outcomes necessary for sustainable participation. Most evaluation approaches define efficiency in economic terms. Animal recording systems lack outputs of direct economic benefits; hence, efficiency evaluation based on utility derived from the records would be more laudable. In that case, a system is considered efficient when outcome-utility-dependent participation is sustained. Approaches for evaluating efficiency based on the utility of outputs are, however, unavailable. The current study presents an approach for evaluating the efficiency of animal recording based on output utility using the institutional analysis and development framework. The approach evaluates efficiency by incorporating institutional issues influencing the operations of the system and its outcomes. It considers animal recording as an action arena with various actors in three action situations, namely: animal identification and registration, pedigree and performance recording and animal evaluation and information utilization. The variables include the positions occupied by actors, their actions, the outcomes associated with the actions, the level of control over choice, available information and the cost and benefits of engagement. As an interactive process, animal recording has rules that order relationships between actors. It also exists within a biophysical system and community whose attributes, combined with the rules, influence the actions and outcomes of recording. These are evaluated by looking at rule formation structures, enforcement and compliance and the level of interaction between the recording system and other biophysical characteristics and the community for their effects on outcomes, their utility and sustainability of recording. Participatory tools, Stakeholder matrix and Venn diagrams are used to identify the variables, quantify their interactions and link them to outputs. The applicability of the approach is tested using a case where information systems are imperfect. The approach successfully identifies missing actors within the action arena, poor rule conformance due to weak enforcement agencies and the absence of rules that govern outcomes and ensure the utility of outcomes as hindrances to the utility of recording and hence the efficiency of the system. It may therefore be used to evaluate the efficiency of systems whose outputs do not have a direct market value and in situations where quantitative market information is scarce.

AB  - The ever-accelerating process of introduction and establishment of invasive alien species (IAS) in marine waters requires engaging different actors in the management and planning. To address this challenge, stakeholders need an integrated approach for defining actions of control and management within an ecosystem-based framework: to seek and enhance coordination, collaboration and trust among all stakeholders affected by changes in linked marine social - ecological systems. This study explores the complexities and opportunities in managing economically valuable IAS, demonstrating the need for tailored management strategies that consider key ecological details needed for successful control such as timing of removals and key economic considerations such as appropriate incentive mechanisms and time horizons in favor of long-term conservation goals. We propose a set of actions that can serve as a roadmap for effective IAS control and management, considering their dual role as nuisances and valuable resources. These actions pertain to local, regional and international levels, encouraging meaningful stakeholder engagement through co-management structures that can foster the development of robust management plans, enabling better IAS control. The outcome holds potential for positive contributions to the blue economy- sustainable use of marine resources, including fisheries, tourism, and renewable energy- and for meeting sustainability objectives.

AB  - The concept of maritime circularity has gained increasing attention to address challenges arising from the net-zero targets of the maritime industry. The circular economy provides potential solutions to address these challenges through reuse, remanufacturing, and recycling practices. However, the industry faces complex challenges, including inefficient reverse supply chains, a lack of awareness about circular economy principles, standardisation issues, and the need for digital infrastructure to provide vital information in the sector. These challenges prevent the implementation of circularity practices, as access to crucial data throughout the vessel's life cycle is obstructed. This novel research aims to create a robust first-of-its-kind database solution specifically designed to support the industry's shift towards circularity. The database will facilitate fast and transparent information flow between the stakeholders, providing foundations for asset tracking and a robust reverse supply chain. A case study was conducted to show that a database could help extract higher financial value from end-of-life ships by over 80%. The ageing fleet increases the urgency of utilising such a database, which could be a pivotal strategy for a sustainable and circular industry. This digital solution offers significant benefits to all industry stakeholders and allows holistic resource management, influencing maritime operations' sustainability, resilience, and profitability.

AB  - In an era of growing emphasis on sustainable development and the social responsibility of higher education, universities are increasingly seeking innovative ways to integrate learning with community engagement. This study aims to integrate University Social Responsibility (USR) with general education through micro-courses focused on Community-Based Tourism (CBT) within a Participatory Action Research (PAR) framework. A research team from National Chiayi University collaborated closely with the Haomei community in Taiwan over a two-year period to co-develop courses covering religious traditions, industrial culture, historical heritage, and ecological conservation. These courses provided students with immersive, hands-on learning experiences. A total of 78 students from 28 academic disciplines participated, enhancing their sense of social responsibility and community engagement. The findings reveal five key factors essential for successful university-community collaboration: trust building, shared objectives, continuous communication, resource sharing, and adaptability. The study demonstrates that integrating USR with innovative educational practices can drive universities to become agents of social change. This model not only strengthens student learning and engagement but also promotes sustainable community development, offering a valuable framework for higher education institutions worldwide.

AB  - Empowering communities to engage with the energy transformation is vital to meet climate change mitigation and sustainable development goals. Communities have a key role to play in the energy transformation, through the uptake of new technologies and changing how they engage with energy. However, they remain marginalised limiting the broader benefits of meaningful participation such as energy democracy, energy justice and energy citizenship, which may be achieved through transformation. Addressing this problem requires an understanding of how to facilitate empowerment. Using a multidisciplinary approach, this paper synthesises the literature on community empowerment for sustainable transformations. It outlines a conceptualisation of empowerment through its definition, drivers and outcomes. Community empowerment in the energy transformation should be about the community's own goals and transformative action. This view of empowerment can be enabled through a variety of different drivers. Empowerment is identified as a multifaceted concept associated with a range of different outcomes such as participation, agency, autonomy and power-shift. Whilst the four outcomes identified in this review are typically described in isolation; we suggest that they are instead a scale wherein each step is a form of empowerment in its own right and yet represents an overall trajectory of empowerment. Facilitating community empowerment within the energy transformation requires a shift in both research and practice.

AB  - Consumer preferences are changing, resulting in an increased demand for both organic milk and raw milk due to their perceived higher nutritional value and positive contribution to animal welfare. To compare the advantages and disadvantages of these products with conventional pasteurised milk, a sustainability assessment was performed incorporating social, environmental and economic factors. The assessment showed that raw organic milk gave the highest overall sustainability score. This is due to, for example, a high score for animal welfare and a high score for the environmental factors due to the omission of the pasteurisation step compared with conventional milk. The latter may pose human health risks due to the possible presence of pathogens in raw milk. As the approach followed is transparent, it allows policy makers to discuss the outcome of the sustainability assessment both with stakeholders and the general public, which will facilitate the decision making process.

AB  - Surfacing the connections between science engagement, engaged science, and sustainability sciences, we urge a re-evaluation of sustainability science's beneficiaries and goals, by advocating a transdisciplinary approach to address sustainability challenges, based on a relational ontology. Thinking with posthumanist, feminist new materialist and Black feminist theories, we consider the importance of multispecies attention and empathy in scientific research. We propose a concept of evolving new perceptual organs in humans to enhance collective responsiveness, inspired by the lateral line organ in fish and their collaborative intelligence for navigating contemporary social and ecological crises and injustices in 'hot messes'.

AB  - The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) is a major step forward towards an integrated approach of biodiversity and conservation to sustainable development. The CBD mentions in its preamble the intrinsic value of biological diversity and the ecological, genetic, social, economic, scientific, educational, cultural, recreational and aesthetic values of biological diversity and its components. However, there are still grave implementation deficits in practise on global, European, and national level. Therefore, the following research analyses the extend to which the different values mentioned in the preamble of the CBD are already included into a selection of European and international regulations related to biodiversity and to which extent a condensed amount of the same criteria is applied for comprehensive, transparent, and comparable evaluations. The study reveals that the established European and international biodiversity-related regulations do not sufficiently consider the different values of biodiversity, but also do not relate them to the same incomplete criteria. They still follow the traditional nature conservation approach, which has failed to halt the loss of biodiversity. Democratic participatory processes are needed, which integrate the different measures of Agenda 21 while applying the interdisciplinary evaluation framework of biodiversity for sustainable development.

AB  - In recent years, the use of gamified systems in education has increased due to the growing empirical evidence of their usefulness in improving motivation and participation in learning processes, resulting in sustainable social development. To take advantage of the opportunities for improvements in the sustainability of education presented by gamification, in addition to the decision to create gamified systems in higher education, this article investigates the willingness of student teachers to learn with gamified systems. The research method is quantitative, with validated instruments used to measure: (1) student perception of gamification; (2) player profile; and (3) screen time, with n = 569 student teachers from the fifteen regions of Chile. The results show that students prefer to learn with gamified systems rather than in a traditional way, with a significant difference (Wilcoxon z = -18.86, p < 0.01). There are significant positive and negative relationships corresponding with the gamer profiles. However, as a finding, a negative relationship was found between the number of hours spent playing video games and the perception of learning through gamified systems. In conclusion, Chilean student teachers present a favorable disposition to teacher training with gamified systems. However, the disposition varies in relation to the number of hours spent playing video games.

KW  - IMPACT
AB  - The transition from fossil fuels to clean energy is a pivotal challenge in global climate efforts. China's strategy emphasizes an orderly phase-out of fossil fuels, advocating for renewable energy as a sustainable alternative. This shift is integral to China's "common prosperity" agenda, which seeks to harmonize economic growth with social equity and environmental sustainability. However, achieving this balance presents complex challenges, particularly in decoupling economic progress from traditional energy consumption patterns. This study addresses the critical need to evaluate how renewable energy contributes to common prosperity by developing a comprehensive indicator framework. By analyzing the dynamic evolution of prosperity levels across 30 Chinese provinces from 2008 to 2020, the research highlights regional disparities and identifies key areas for policy intervention. The findings underscore the importance of integrating renewable energy initiatives with social policies to enhance living standards and promote equitable economic growth. This paper provides valuable insights for policymakers and stakeholders aiming to advance sustainable development and achieve common prosperity in China, offering a foundation for more informed and effective energy and economic policies.

AB  - The concept of sustainability is associated with numerous evaluation approaches making various claims. To their credit, the evaluation approaches contributed to the evolution of the concept from a rather vague and mostly qualitative notion to progressively being defined in more quantitative terms. The diversity of low-input ruminant meat production systems make the use of a single blueprint for sustainability evaluation completely impractical. Most sustainability evaluation approaches fail to adequately and accurately take account of the realities of the low-input production systems. For example, the multifunctionality of ruminant livestock and other credence values of rangeland-based production systems are rarely considered in most sustainability evaluations. Development of a holistic and transdisciplinary system-specific approach that effectively address the complexity and realities of the low-input production could be important. This review examines the strength and weaknesses of currently available sustainability evaluation frameworks and suggests parameters for a system-specific evaluation framework for low-input ruminant meat production.

AB  - In recent years, 5G and the Internet of Things (IoT) have been integrated into a variety of applications to support sustainable communication systems. In the presence of intermediate hardware, IoT devices collect the network data and transfer them to cloud technologies. The interconnect machines provide essential information to the connected devices over the Internet. Many solutions have been proposed to address the dynamic and unexpected characteristics of IoT-based networks and to support smart developments. However, more work needs to explore efficient quality-aware data routing for distributed processing. Additionally, to handle the massive amount of data created by smart cities and achieve the transportation objectives for resource restrictions, artificial intelligence (AI)-oriented approaches are necessary. This research proposes a secured protocol with collaborative learning for IoT-enabled sustainable communication using AI techniques. This approach increases systems' reaction times in critical conditions and also controls the smart functionalities for inter-device communication. Furthermore, fitness computing can help in balancing the contribution of quality-aware metrics to achieve load balancing and efficient energy consumption. To deal with security, IoT communication is broken down into stages, resulting in a more dependable network for unpredictable environments. The simulation results of the proposed protocol have been compared to existing approaches and improved the performance of response time by 17%, energy consumption by 14%, number of re-transmissions by 16%, and computing overhead by 16%, under a varying number of nodes and data packets.

AB  - As the global human population increases, the demand to conserve, restore, create, and sustainably manage ecosystems will increase as well. Forested ecosystems are of particular interest because of the biodiversity they support and their diverse values to people. Developments in conservation, restoration forestry, and in the study of designer ecosystems provide a diverse set of tools with which to pursue sustainable forestry goals. Nonetheless, we suggest that sustainable forestry can only be achieved by fully considering ecological, economic, and social needs in landscapes. This will require a clear realization of the trade-offs in site-specific management approaches and a multifaceted, landscape-scale perspective for evaluation of sustainability criteria. We propose collaborative creation of Sustainable Forestry Portfolios as a means to encourage the breadth of thinking required to guide sustainable forest management. We discuss 3 examples of Sustainable Forestry Portfolios with relevance to different settings in the future: 1) the Triad Approach, 2) Forest Landscape Restoration, and 3) Urban Forestry. In all settings, sustainable forestry is not solely a technical problem, but a challenge that must be met through a multidimensional perspective, interdisciplinary collaboration, and with active engagement of the people that live and work in the landscape.

LA  - English
AB  - Sustainable development can only be achieved through a broad participatory process involving all layers of societies, both in the public and private sectors. International institutions, including the United Nations system, can contribute to the process through setting standards and providing a framework for collaborative endeavors. This paper makes a critical review of UN sponsored special conferences on global issues relating to sustainable development over the past 20 years. It discusses some negative tendencies that detract from the effectiveness of multilateral efforts, as well as good progress that has already begun, towards sustainable development. This paper also discusses the need for conceptual tools for the assessment of options for action in rational pursuit of sustainability as global interest. The paper also suggests a conceptual equation that might help to articulate the global interest focusing on the relationships between resources, technology and population.

AB  - Social learning is increasingly identified as a valuable tool in the pursuit of sustainable development agenda in the same manner that participatory processes are seen as important avenues for creating social learning situations. Through an empirical case study of participatory processes undertaken to rehabilitate a community-based irrigation system in the Philippines, this study explores two interrelated questions: what feature of the participatory irrigation management approach implemented in the Philippines facilitates social learning, and what were the limiting factors for its long-term success? One of the most prominent features of participatory approaches elucidated in this case study is the integration of traditional institutions into more contemporary formalized farmer associations. While this approach helped legitimize intervention and enhanced local cooperation for a successful project implementation, our findings underscores the need for carefully designed participatory processes that are specifically aimed at creating long term learning outcomes. Further study is recommended to further explore how social learning can be facilitated beyond the intervention phase of project-based participatory approaches.

AB  - Opening up knowledge-action systems to a wider range of disciplinary and societal actors is considered to be a necessary step in achieving transformative change for sustainability. In science for sustainability, there is a growing body of experience and literature of putting this 'co-production' into action. However, there is an opportunity to strengthen the application of analytical resources for more explicitly recognising and accounting for the power relations embedded in these initiatives. This paper deploys social theory from science and technology studies to develop an approach to perceive power relations between the participants, processes and products of co-production. This necessitates paying attention to the multiple and distributed organisational spaces where co-production takes place to discern: who participates; who (and what) is represented; how deliberations are structured; and how outcomes are circulated. This paper shows that these organisational dimensions of participation, representation, deliberation, and circulation not only give structure to co-productive forums, but can also define the power relations between their participants, processes and products. The paper then illustrates the applicability of this approach using the case of a current global expert process for biodiversity: The Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES). This case study offers insights on the challenges and opportunities for designing and evaluating co-production initiatives for sustainability.

AB  - There is an urgent need for transformational change in agriculture to address current and future issues caused by climate change, biodiversity loss and socio-ecological disruption. But change is slow to come and is hindered by a lack of transdisciplinary evidence on potential approaches which take a systems approach. The research described here was co-developed with the Pasture Fed Livestock Association in the UK to objectively evidence their practices. These include producing pasture-based meat from livestock fed on pasture and pasture-based forages alone. This approach sits alongside wider aims of fitting their practices with the ecological conditions on each individual farm to facilitate optimal production and working collaboratively through a forum for sharing knowledge. The research provides strong indications that the PFLA approach to livestock production is resilient and viable, as well as contributing to wider public goods delivery, despite variability within and between farms. It also reveals that learning and adaption of practice (through farmer experience) is central to farming using agro-ecological approaches. This fluidity of practice presents challenges for reductionist approaches to "measuring" agricultural innovations.

AB  - The article describes a process of preparing a research design on place-shaping, as outcome of a process of co-design between academic actors and non-academic actors in Brazil, South Africa and The Netherlands, taking place in the context of the project TRANSPLACE. The joint research design addresses varied sustainability issues as well as common challenges across areas of environmental change, in nine specific social-ecological settings in these countries. Key is the identification of innovative place-shaping practices or 'seeds of change', embedded in social-ecological systems and place-based assets. These seeds of change offer insight into how to support a place based approach to development, via the engagement and collaboration of varied actors. The article first reviews the literature on place and transformation. Furthermore the process of co-designing a joint research agenda is described. This process resulted in varied outcomes, such as a joint research agenda, the identification of 'seeds of change', and an overview of sustainability issues, learning challenges and involved stakeholders in the nine research sites. The article shows how engagement and learning in knowledge networks can be supported on different scales, and ends with lessons learned and perceived benefits of having gone through a co-design process.

AB  - When designers of activities concerned with the dissemination of research findings pursue their practice all too often, the linear model is implicitly or explicitly the default position. This paper uses the lens of praxis (theory-informed practical action) to offer a shift in possibility away from reliance on the linear model of innovation to a second-order modality of research practice more suited to sustainable development goal (SDG) implementation. Whilst second-order modalities of knowledge production, necessary to enact sustainability transitions and transformative praxis, are emerging many lack purposefully designed modes of praxis and are limited in their considerations regarding enactment and performativity. We report on the testing and evaluation of a purpose-driven design of a 'learning system' within the Australian urban-water sector to enact a 'systemic inquiry' capable of generating social learning. Changes in understanding and/or practices by those who participated were achieved, thus satisfying key criteria for initiating but not necessarily sustaining social learning. The praxis innovation described is suited to situations best framed as uncertain, complex and contested. The positive outcomes of the enacted 'learning system' support the case for more investment in action-oriented research to support innovation in the field of second-order systems praxis.

AB  - Stakeholder management has an important role in the success of the project because the strategies, plans, methods, and processes for stakeholders greatly determine the success of sustainable construction implementation. Lean construction is one of the principles in implementing sustainable construction by maximizing value and minimizing waste to increase productivity. This study aims to analyze the stakeholder engagement assessment matrix in lean construction, analyze the drivers and barriers in lean construction, and develop stakeholder engagement strategies to improve the implementation of sustainable lean construction. For this study, a questionnaire survey with 61 respondents was used. The data analysis method uses the Certainty Index, RII, Fuzzy AHP, and Fuzzy-TOPSIS. The findings of this research show that there are engagement gaps among stakeholders such as owners, contractors, consultants, subcontractors, architects, the government, local governments, and NGOs. There is no engagement gap between project suppliers and investors. The highest barrier to implementing sustainable lean construction is a lack of knowledge and skills in using lean tools and principles, while the highest driver to implement sustainable lean construction is improved time efficiency and process standardization. The best strategy for increasing stakeholder engagement is by having governments develop regulations and standardize green and sustainable materials.

AB  - Although ecosystem-based management can lead to sustainable resource use, its successful implementation depends on stakeholders' acceptance. A framework to integrate scientific knowledge about the ecosystems with stakeholders' preferences is therefore needed. We propose here a 'Public Sentiment Index,' or PSI, as an integration framework that combines an ecosystem model (Ecopath with Ecosim; EwE) with a public choice model (the damage schedule). Using Chesapeake Bay as a case study, we demonstrate the development of the PSI, based on judgments of Bay stakeholders, including 'watermen' (commercial fishers), seafood wholesalers and retailers, recreational fishers, representatives from non-governmental organizations, scientists and managers on a range of Bay ecosystems. The high PSI for Chesapeake Bay suggests a consensus amongst Bay stakeholders who, understanding the need for restoring the Bay ecosystem, may accept difficult policy choices and support their implementation.

AB  - Although most scholars acknowledged that development is a transnational process, existing discussions usually focus on negative externalities such as pollution, epidemics, violent conflicts and economic crises. This chapter considers a form of positive externality, knowledge spillovers and argues that countries can innovate in policymaking, both design and implementation, and achieve more sustainable forms of development by participating in a multiplex policy learning network. Furthermore, we emphasise that policy knowledge transfer should not be one-way, so global governance becomes a truly inclusive and interactive process. One fundamental problem to this end is the design of such multiplex policy learning networks. This chapter adopts an evidence-based approach to this problem. Using quantitative analysis, we identify performance-based clusters of status leaders, intermediates and followers in Sub-Saharan Africa with respect to the constituents of indicator-based performances on each Sustainable Development Goal (SDG), and offer a detailed contextualisation for multiplex policy learning in Sub-Saharan Africa with a prospective design of an international conference agenda for SDGs.

AB  - This research explores the roles of (1) the stakeholder categories conservation association, land use association, public authority and research group, (2) Organizational Culture, operationalized by the Organizational Culture Assessment Instrument; (3) Environmental Worldview, operationalized by the New Environmental Paradigm; and (4) Environmental Risk Perception, operationalized by the Myths of Physical Nature, in shaping the interactions in the social network of environmental stakeholders in the city and district of Osnabr & uuml;ck in Northwest Germany. First, the study examines the stakeholder categories (1), regarding the expression of the constructs (2), (3) and (4) among them. Second, all constructs (1), (2), (3) and (4) are examined regarding possible correlations with the presence of collaboration and conflict between stakeholders. Our analysis reveals that (1) Stakeholder Categories are significantly correlated with the presence of collaboration, but not of conflict. (2) A significant correlation between membership of a stakeholder category and the dominant manifestation of a particular organizational culture is present, while no correlation between Organizational Cultures and the presence of collaborations or conflicts could be found. Moreover, the study highlights (3) a generally pro-environmental orientation across stakeholders as captured by the New Environmental Paradigm (NEP), indicating a shared foundation for potential collaborative efforts. (4) Analysis of Environmental Risk Perception, through the Cultural Theory's myths of physical nature, uncovers a widespread preference for the hierarchical myth, suggesting a common perception of environmental risks and resilience. This study emphasizes the importance of understanding psychological and social dimensions in environmental stakeholder management to enhance collaborative efforts towards sustainable development. It highlights the need for management approaches that acknowledge the complex interplay of diverse psychological constructs in driving effective and sustainable collaborations between stakeholders of regional land use, nature conservation, public authorities, academia and other sectors depending on the context. Through its insights into stakeholder interactions, this research contributes to the broader discourse on achieving sustainable development goals through informed, cooperative stakeholder engagement.

AB  - This paper discusses the role normative aspects play in different approaches of science-practice collaboration, in particular as action research, (Mode 2) Transdisciplinarity (Td), Transition Management (TM), and Transformative Science (TSc). We elaborate on the different roles that scientists in these processes play. They work as facilitators (or contribute to a facilitated Td process), as activists (i.e., activist researchers) in TM projects, and as catalysts in TSc. Td processes develop socially robust solutions for sustainable transitioning and impacts on the science system through mutual learning and by integrating epistemics (i.e., ways of knowing) from science and practice and focusing on the empowerment of stakeholders. Science is viewed as a public good aiming to serve all key stakeholders. Researchers involved in TM projects strive to influence ongoing transition processes by actively engaging and participating in them, including lobbying for and empowering transformative changes toward sustainability based upon the researchers' own analyses and world views. The TSc approach takes a catalyst perspective of the scientist's role in inducing processes of strategic (societal) transition when including certain stakeholder groups. The paper focuses on what roles normative aspects play in the different approaches and new societal demands imposed on science and universities. Based on this, we conclude that a new order of universities, public knowledge institutions, and boundary institutions is forthcoming.

AB  - Beef production systems are at the center of ongoing discussion and debate on food systems sustainability. There is a growing interest among beef producers, consumers, and other beef supply chain stakeholders in achieving greater sustainability within the industry, but the relationship of this interest to general sustainability issues such as climate change, biodiversity loss, food security, livelihood risks, and animal welfare concerns is unclear. Specifically, there is very little research documenting how beef producers define and view the concept of sustainability and how to achieve it. Producer perspectives are critical to identifying constraints to sustainability transitions or to help build agreement with other producers about the shared values such transitions may support. Through a secondary analysis of survey data of U.S. beef producers (n = 911) conducted in 2021 by the Trust in Food division of Farm Journal, a corporation that provides content, data, and business insights to the agricultural community (e.g., producers, processors/distributors, and retailers), we investigated what "sustainable beef" means to U.S. beef producers, highlighting the key components and constraints they perceive to achieving desirable sustainability outcomes. Leveraging the three-pillar model of sustainability as a framework for analysis, we identified key themes producers use to define "sustainable beef." We found that producers collectively viewed sustainability as: (1) multidimensional and interconnected; (2) semi-closed and regenerative; (3) long-lasting; and (4) producer-centered, although an integrated perspective uniting these aspects was rare. We discuss how these perspectives may be the basis for sustainability efforts supported by producers and raise future research considerations toward a shared understanding of what sustainability is and what is needed for enduring sustainability solutions in the U.S. beef industry.

AB  - In the past few decades, a competitive landscape, learned customers and rigorous regulations have forced manufacturing industries to focus on sustainability alongside operational efficiency. The main objective of the present study is to develop a systematic Green Lean Six Sigma (GLSS) framework for improvement in operational efficiency together with environmental and social sustainability. Further, the proposed framework was tested in a leading manufacturing company. The framework was designed with insights gained from the literature and industrial personnel and encompasses the systematic application of different tools of the Green paradigm, Lean, and Six Sigma, from the identification and assessment of the problem to the sustainment of the adopted measures. A systematic application of lifecycle assessment and social lifecycle assessment was used to assess environmental and societal performance. The sustainability focused GLSS framework enhances the environmental capability, process performance and provides a new perspective for researchers and practitioners to support GLSS projects to achieving higher sustainability dynamics.

AB  - Improving heritage educommunication on the web 2.0 is key to reaching certain sustainable development goals focused on educational quality and citizen participation. Although numerous partial studies have already been conducted, to date neither assessment tools nor detailed studies are available regarding the quality of educommunicative initiatives. Spain and Italy's archaeological heritage museums have a consolidated track record on Twitter, which has been bolstered by museum closures due to COVID-19 and has resulted in a significant change to their educommunicative policies. The present article aims to analyze educommunicative actions undertaken on Twitter at Italian archaeological museums, compare their strategies with a previous study on Spanish institutions, and analyze to what degree the sustainability of heritage, citizen participation, learning opportunities, and universal access are being promoted. This mixed method analysis was carried out through the implementation of a web 2.0 heritage educommunication analysis tool focused on three key factors: educational procedure, R-elational interactions, and the prevailing learning paradigm, as well as a content analysis of the variables that comprise them. The key findings suggest that neither country is close to achieving a quality educommunicative strategy. Italian archaeological heritage institutions use Twitter simply as an advertising platform. Despite being a social media platform, participative initiatives are scarcely promoted, although heritage sustainability is promoted through raising awareness of conservation and appreciation. Spanish institutions, however, demonstrated the opposite pattern of use.

AB  - In recent sustainability assessments, transdisciplinary approaches have been used to bridge contested normative views among many societal actors, policymakers and researchers. Transdisciplinary research is mainly based on three premises: (1) various perspectives need to be incorporated and discussed to empower actors, (2) the collaboration and co-creation of knowledge between academic and societal actors allows to better grasp the complexity of a real-world problem, and (3) a mutual learning process arises which could increase the legitimacy of decisions and their implementation in practice. Despite many examples of transdisciplinary projects, few assessments have been done that question whether such a project fulfils the premises of transdisciplinary research. Therefore, we report on a reflexive assessment of an initiative set up to foster the transformation of the Flemish agri-food system towards sustainability. The case study involved both scientific and societal actors with different views, making it possible to implement a transdisciplinary process, evaluate the expectations and give suggestions for future processes. Evaluation criteria are linked to context, process and outcomes. Analysis of the qualitative and quantitative data indicates that the initiative did empower the transformation towards sustainability. Furthermore, results show that, in this case, a transdisciplinary approach can fulfil its premises. However, some critical factors are identified, such as the importance of the context specificity and a flexible, adaptive and iterative process.

AB  - How to secure a sustainable future is currently one of the key challenges across society. Bandura's theory of human agency provides important insights into this question by recognising the role of individual, proxy and collective agency in initiating action and change. In this article, we conceptualise sustainability agency and discuss psychological features and competencies that are relevant for supporting agency in sustainability education. Agency may manifest in different forms and contexts: countless actions in individual lives, communities, and local, national and global scenes can contribute to sustainability. This range of opportunities to be engaged in sustainability transformations can be better acknowledged in sustainability education in formal, non-formal and informal learning settings by broadening and clarifying the targets and indicators of successful sustainability education. Consequently, sustainability education and related participation in advancing sustainability can become more inclusive and meaningful for actors with diverse backgrounds.

AB  - Using an e-calendar, a web-based intervention program, informal mindfulness activities, and work engagement, this study evaluated the sustainability of the quality of life for staff with obesity at a Malaysian public university. The participants were identified through the human resources department of the university. The inclusion criteria required an age of 20-59 years and BMI >= 25. The exclusion criteria were pregnancy, the use of weight loss pills or supplements that can influence weight, chronic illness, and the use of medication that requires physician monitoring. Thirty-one university staff were assessed for quality of life using a within-subject repeated-measures design. The participants were asked to use the study website for 10 to 15 min/day for 36 weeks. Data was captured by a pretest, posttest, and two follow-up surveys. The results showed an increase in the posttest mean scores for all domains representing the quality of life. As expected, three domains increased at follow-up 1 and were maintained at follow-up 2. This suggests that informal mindfulness practices and work engagement using an e-calendar are practical means to increase and sustain the quality of life of employees. In conclusion, the quality of life among university staff with obesity can be improved using informal mindfulness activities and work engagement, and an e-calendar is another alternative method of practicing mindfulness at home and at the workplace. The implications of this study are also discussed.

AB  - There is an urgent need for radical transformations of unsustainable socio-technical systems, such as food, mobility, and housing. These transformations will not take place without new policies and research. In order to achieve these transitions, learning must be a central feature based on thorough evaluations of the actions taken. Evaluations have been conducted and studied for decades, but traditional evaluation approaches have largely been developed to produce knowledge for incremental changes, not for radical transformations. This article develops a framework for interdisciplinary evaluations targeting transformative changes toward a more sustainable society. The framework combines evaluation theory and practice with transition theory, sociology of science, policy analyses, and environmental psychology. While the primary purpose of the framework is to help design evaluations that would better enhance learning for transitions, it can also be used for systematic meta-evaluations of past evaluations.

In this new framing, a secondary literature analysis of Barcelona's struggle against air pollution is exemplified as a wicked problem caused by diverse stakeholder interests and their different sustainability concepts in socio-economic and environmental development. The paper offers a new perspective on sustainable, transformative pathways in cities which run on participative and adaptive governance principles. The backwards integration into the underlying principles of the meta-theories illustrates the value of triple helix and transition research and the benefit of their integration for examining and designing sustainable transition pathways.

AB  - In an evolving world, effectively managing human-natural systems under uncertainty becomes paramount, particularly when targeting the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The complexity in multi-actor decision-making and multi-sectoral settings, coupled with intricate relationships and potential conflicting management approaches, makes understanding the local implications of progressing towards the global SDGs challenging. We used a transdisciplinary approach for knowledge co-production with local stakeholders to assess the impact of local action to boost sustainability in the Goulburn-Murray region, Victoria, Australia, and its alignment with global action towards the SDGs. Together, we co-developed 11 local actions geared towards achieving four locally important environmental and socioeconomic SDGs, with a particular emphasis on addressing potential 'spillovers'-unintended effects that influence SDGs across scales. Through system dynamics modelling, we evaluated the interplay between these local actions and global scenarios, emphasising their synergies, trade-offs, and the resulting impact on SDG indicators. Key findings indicate a predominant synergy between global and local actions across most SDG indicators. However, certain areas like dairy production, riverine algal blooms, and agricultural profit displayed trade-offs. Local actions significantly impacted indicators, such as crop production, dairy output, agricultural land use, and agricultural profitability. Findings highlighted the need for complementary actions in areas, such as water availability management, skilled workforce, and salinity control. This study underscored the importance of harmonising local initiatives with global sustainability objectives and can inspire local governance to champion resilience policies that harmoniously integrate local actions with global sustainability goals, adapting to evolving uncertainty scenarios.

AB  - Large civil infrastructure projects, such as airports, highways, railways, townships, and other developments, are critical for contributing to the social, economic, and environmental pillars of sustainability along with the UNSDGs. However, it is not enough to simply assess their impacts; organizations and stakeholders involved in creating, operating, and maintaining these projects must also report on them. Recent reports by UNEP indicate that the civil infrastructure sector is slow in adopting these principles of sustainability assessment and reporting. The aim of this study is to develop an integrated approach for assessing the sustainability of civil infrastructure projects and sustainability reporting for organizations and stakeholders while achieving the UN-SDGs. To achieve this aim, the study employs a two-step process. In the first step, a correspondence matrix is derived from the sustainability assessment parameters of various infrastructure rating tools (InRTs), Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standards, and UN-SDGs targets. In the second step, a composite indicator called the Sustainability Alignment Index (SAI) is developed. The SAI comprises two sub-indices, namely the TBL-Sustainability Coverage Index (TSCI) and the TBL-Sustainability Disclosure Quality Index (TSDQI). The correspondence matrix, indices, and sub-indices are then used to evaluate the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the sustainability disclosures of selected civil infrastructure companies in Asia and Europe. The study's findings question the comprehensiveness of the evaluating criteria used in InRTs. It also reveals the lack of alignment between an infrastructure project's sustainability assessment criteria, GRI standards, and UN-SDGs targets. Moreover, the results emphasize the insufficient coverage of environmental sustainability assessment and reporting parameters in the disclosures made by the companies. The developed correspondence matrix, indices, and sub-indices can be used by organizations for comparing both quantitative and qualitative measures to understand their relative positions. Additionally, it will enable the public, policymakers, and other key stakeholders to compare different dimensions of sustainability more effectively.

The research questions that guided the study are: In what ways may Minecraft act as a boundary object between children's formal and informal learning about science and sustainable development? In what ways may Minecraft act as a boundary object when children build relationships with nature? Semi-structured interviews were conducted with six children. A thematic analysis approach was used to analyze the interviews. This study shows that in the Minecraft context, the children gained a breadth of everyday experiences related to scientific phenomena and sustainability. Further, the findings indicate that children merged their experiences in the virtual world with experiences in the physical world. In this sense, Minecraft involves science and sustainability content that crosses the boundary between the virtual world and reality. Thus, we suggest that Minecraft bridged children's physical and virtual relationships with nature; that is to say, Minecraft became a boundary object that allowed children to experience nature and encounter knowledge that they would not otherwise have been able to experience.

AB  - This chapter reports on an innovative approach to in-service teacher education focusing on Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) aimed at faculty in a UK university. Building on the underpinning philosophies that characterise sustainability education: participation, experiential learning and authenticity, a module on ESD was designed which at first flipped and then moved beyond the classroom. An online resource was developed to house the necessary declarative content which student-teachers accessed before the class. Class time was then spent within deliberative, dialogic and 'walkabout' learning spaces. These included a critically informed tour of the university campus and community exploring the 'unseen university', following energy and waste processes, evaluating accessibility and inclusivity and considering the university as an example of an organisation in transition. They also afforded the opportunity for student-teachers to meet key sustainability individuals from procurement, estates, marketing and finances, as well as curriculum champions and of course students themselves. Discussions took place in boiler rooms, on stairwells, in coffee shops and in parks. Following an action research strategy for change leadership, student-teachers collaboratively and critically dissected these experiences and negotiated assignments which were not only informed by these experiences but that sought to address specific sustainability needs identified on our journeying through the university as a manifold learning space. At the end of the course, student-teachers used the UNECE (Learning for the future: competencies in education for sustainable development. UNECE, Geneva, 2012) framework for Competences in Education for Sustainable Development to assess what had been learnt and where to focus ongoing CPD. The course has proved popular in its home institution and has been showcased as an example of good practice by the European Communion through their 'Lifelong Learning Programme' (Mader et al. in State of the Art report: mapping opportunities for developing education for sustainable development competences in the UE4SD partner countries. University Educators for Sustainable Development, Cheltenham, 2014).

AB  - Why are sustainability goals so hard to achieve? In a recent Note & Comment, Santos et al. (Sustain Sci 19:1097-1105, 2024) call for an examination of 'human critical determinants' as barriers to the achievement of sustainability goals. We fully support this call. However, we argue that the vital role played by 'inner worlds' cannot be understood if abstracted away from the context in which cognition is situated., i.e., it is not just 'inner worlds' that must be accounted for, but also their place within their broader situational and social contexts. We recommend future research in sustainability science consider the evidence and frameworks accumulated by psychologists on what humans, as socially and culturally situated organisms, need to thrive, and we explain why this interdisciplinarity could be transformative towards achieving the goals of sustainability science.

AB  - This paper develops a framework for policymakers supporting sustainable development through international collaboration in science, technology, and innovation (STI). The approach can be applied to derive the national policy strategy for international collaboration in STI. The contribution focuses on the case of Germany in the field of food and agriculture. Accordingly, considering Germany's current strategic approach for international collaboration in STI, an evidence-based tool for priority setting in the selection of potential partners and technology fields is developed and implemented. More specifically, the approach assesses the opportunity environment for international STI collaboration of Germany with potential partners using patent and economic indicators to capture technological capabilities, technological demand, economic relevance of food, and agriculture in national economies as well as technological and export specialization in food and agriculture. The results present policy strategies enhancing sustainable development.

AB  - This study examined international students' engagement in leisure activities using data derived from an integrated method and analyzed through acculturation and means-end chain approaches. A cluster analysis was conducted to identify acculturation types. An initial qualitative survey with 30 respondents produced the questionnaire items, and a quantitative survey to construct value maps was conducted targeting 415 respondents. The cluster analysis identified bicultural acceptance, heritage culture maintenance, and bicultural marginalization as distinct types that distinguish the acculturation level among international students. The results from three acculturation types indicate that the significant items and strong linkages between attribute-consequence and consequence-value at each level reflect the international students' inner thoughts and ultimate value. Such strong associations provide value maps, which differ according to the acculturation types. Such findings present that availability of leisure services is necessary to better cater to the special interests of international students at different stages of acculturation. Given that international student mobility has increased substantially, relevant leisure professionals and organizations should understand that international students' sustainable leisure engagement can only be achieved if attention is paid to cultural contexts.

AB  - Intercultural transdisciplinary research reinforces sustainable social-ecological systems in Latin America. Social learning (SL) is a crucial process within this type of research as it fosters collaboration among diverse groups of people, communities of practice, and cultures. Buen vivir ('well living'), of the popular movements in America, promotes collective responsibility and respect for life. Yeknemilis ('a good life') is a value framework of the Masewal people of the Sierra Madre Oriental, Mexico. Members of Tosepan, an organization of the Masewal and other indigenous peoples of this region, reflected on their cultural roots, ways of life, and relations with the territory to strengthen their alternative and self-determined lifeway. Involvement in participatory research within the transdisciplinary process allowed us to focus on the learnings and conditions that foster values and strategies for yeknemilis. Through participant observation, semi-structured interviews, and participatory activities, we identified five key social learning areas that foster conditions for yeknemilis and life-sustaining relationships in intercultural transdisciplinary collaboration (ITC): collective action agenda, community capacities, intercultural transdisciplinarity, creative reflexivity, and a relational ontology horizon. Finally, we show how the collaborative construction of yeknemilis and social learning practices can be crucial in scaling up collective action toward sustainability.

AB  - Sharing successful practices with other stakeholders is important for achieving SDGs. In this study, with a deep-learning natural language processing model, bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT), the authors aimed to build (1) a classifier that enables semantic mapping of practices and issues in the SDGs context, (2) a visualizing method of SDGs nexus based on co-occurrence of goals (3) a matchmaking process between local issues and initiatives that may embody solutions. A data frame was built using documents published by official organizations and multi-labels corresponding to SDGs. A pretrained Japanese BERT model was fine-tuned on a multi-label text classification task, while nested cross-validation was conducted to optimize the hyperparameters and estimate cross-validation accuracy. A system was then developed to visualize the co-occurrence of SDGs and to couple the stakeholders by evaluating embedded vectors of local challenges and solutions. The paper concludes with a discussion of four future perspectives to improve the natural language processing system. This intelligent information system is expected to help stakeholders take action to achieve the sustainable development goals.

AB  - In 2019, the United Nations released its 10-year policy of "ESD for 2030". Many schools around the world have actively participated in the transformation and have included the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in Education for Sustainable Development (ESD). Many developed countries hope to combine the concept of STEAM education (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Mathematics) with interdisciplinary learning, and apply it to ESD. This study intended to integrate the sustainability concept into Virtual Reality (VR) system-aided STEAM education, in order to provide school children with integrated interdisciplinary STEAM education. A literature review was conducted and the research hypotheses were proposed. The empirical method and questionnaires were used as research methods to investigate the influence of the proposed system on the students' satisfaction, self-efficacy, and learning outcomes after cognition learning. The results of this study showed that the combination of STEAM education, with VR-aided experience courses, could help to improve the learning satisfaction and outcomes of students and to arouse their learning motivation. However, the proposed system needs an ESD that is based on students' traditional culture (such as designing a role-playing game), so that they can improve their self-efficacy through playing a VR game. Although VR games are interesting, they are difficult for some students to play. Therefore, it is necessary to adjust the teaching materials, methods, and strategies appropriately by using information technology, so that ESD can be achieved by inspiring students to explore continuously. The findings can serve as a reference for further relevant studies.

AB  - The increasing social and environmental challenges, particularly poverty, have brought social entrepreneurship, a highly researched domain, to the attention of academicians. It has emerged as a critical issue in the context of economic development and societal well-being. The current study presents a comprehensive bibliometric analysis in the field of social entrepreneurship and poverty alleviation to explain the current state, geographical performance, and future research agenda. Utilizing VOS viewer (version 1.6.20) and R Studio software (version 4.3.2), 461 final articles were examined and extracted from the Web of Science database, covering the period from 1998 to 2022. The findings reveal a significant increase in research activity in this field since 2009, indicating a growing demand for it as a solution to social challenges. Notably, the years 2021-2022 witnessed a remarkable 55% surge in research output. The Sustainability Journal ranks first as the most productive source, followed by the Journal of Cleaner Production. The most prolific authors are Nina Kolleck from Germany, David Littlewood, and Diane Holt from the UK. Additionally, this study assesses the geographic distribution of research contributions, highlighting regions with relatively lower research performance, such as South Asian and African countries. Leading in this domain are the UK, Spain, the USA, and European institutions. Co-citation patterns reveal four thematic clusters: (1) dynamics of social entrepreneurship; (2) sustainable entrepreneurial ecosystem; (3) social entrepreneurship for social innovation; and (4) integrated sustainable entrepreneurship, shedding light on critical aspects and the intellectual structure of this domain. Finally, keyword co-occurrence analysis identifies emerging research areas, e.g., entrepreneurial development, the role of higher education, enterprise collaboration, inclusive growth, and socio-economic empowerment. This research provides valuable insights for policymakers, researchers, and practitioners committed to achieving sustainable social change.

AB  - We describe an action-research project whose objective was to help stakeholders at different organisational levels achieve sustainable land management by developing mediation models and tools. We chose to test a specific approach called companion modelling in the framework of a multidisciplinary research partnership and a formal local partnership (a 'users committee') involving an array of stakeholders at different organisational levels. The study area covers 10,000 km(2) of agro-pastoral land around Lake Guiers in northern Senegal. We conducted studies to update the knowledge base of the area and organised six field workshops that clearly revealed three important tool functions to support decision-making on land use at different scales, i.e. understanding maps, monitoring and evaluating land tenure, and foreseeing changes in land use. We found that a toolbox approach was the best way to implement the three functions and overcome the constraints faced by the research team and those linked to the timing of the project. Therefore, we produced five simple complementary tools aimed at various users: a farm-level optimisation model (for researchers and technical services), a database for land allocations and a discussion tool to assess the impact of land allocation decisions (for the rural council), a paper atlas (for local players) and a regional land use change simulation model (for regional and national planners). Participants were able to work with paper maps, to interpret computer-generated simulations of land use change and understand the strengths and limitations of each. Self-assessment of the research process emphasised the importance of the context and the critical role played by social capital at both the research and the field level, which, in turn, emphasised the need for major improvements in the design and implementation of a quality process for participatory modelling. It turns out that action-research may be an effective way to undertake sustainability science.

AB  - Indiscriminate expansion of agricultural activities into wetlands affects the sustainability of wetland-dependent livelihoods. Systems research is an important tool for identifying and dealing with the underlying drivers of wetland degradation; however, there is limited research employing system tools in Sub-Saharan Africa. This research employed causal loop diagrams and system archetypes to characterize common wetland resource systems in Sub-Saharan Africa, using the wetland agricultural system of Uganda as a case study. Mental models of wetland users were indirectly elicited by interviewing 66 wetland users. Causal loop diagrams were generated to illustrate the multiple, interdependent feedback linkages within the system. The case study wetland is mainly used for farming (40%), vegetation harvesting (26%), and fishing (24%), while other activities like hunting and grazing are carried out by 10% of wetland users. A reinforcing feedback loop was dominant, illustrating how initial encroachment on the wetland to meet livelihood needs can accelerate further encroachment. Based on the dominant loop and current interventions, we characterized the system using three archetypes: tragedy of the commons, shifting the burden, and fixes that fail. A two-pronged approach was proposed, where solutions for decelerating wetland degradation, like restoration activities, can be implemented in the short term while planning long-term measures that take into account the need for alternative livelihoods for wetland-dependent communities and targeting a paradigm shift through continuous sensitization of stakeholders on the benefits of sustainable wetland management.

AB  - Context We describe how large landscape-scale conservation initiatives involving local communities, NGOs and resource managers have engaged with landscape scientists with the goal of achieving landscape sustainability. We focus on two landscapes where local people, practitioners and landscape ecologists have co-produced knowledge to design conservation interventions. Objective We seek to understand how landscape ecology can engage with practical landscape management to contribute to managing landscapes sustainably. Methods We focus on two large tropical landscapes: the Sangha Tri-National landscape (Cameroon, Republic of Congo and the Central African Republic) and the Bateke-Lefini Landscape (Gabon and Republic of Congo). We evaluate (1) a participatory method used in the Sangha Tri-National landscape that embeds interdisciplinary researchers and practitioners within a landscape to apply transdisciplinary learning to landscape conservation and (2) a participatory landscape zoning method where interdisciplinary teams of conservation practitioners analyse local land and resource use in the Bateke-Lefini landscape. Results We find that landscape ecology's tradition of understanding the historical context of resource use can inform landscape conservation practice and natural resource mapping. We also find that the Sangha Group provides an example for landscape ecology on how to integrate local people and their knowledge to better understand and influence landscape processes. Conclusions Place-based engagement as well as the uptake of co-produced knowledge by policy makers are key in enabling sustainable landscapes. Success occurs when researchers, local communities and resource managers engage directly with landscape processes.

AB  - This article explores the essential elements for achieving excellence in international collaborations within health professions education (HPE), drawing on the Association for Medical Education in Europe (AMEE) ASPIRE Award criteria for International Collaboration. The International Collaboration award transcends recognition of excellence through the award; it aims to foster excellence in international HPE collaborations more broadly, by establishing a framework for evaluation and development that functions cross-culturally. This framework is based on five key elements that contribute to successful collaborations: mutually agreed goals; shared responsibilities and leadership structures; processes that support collaboration; demonstrated long-term impact and sustainability, and evaluation and practice sharing. Recognizing the historical context of unequal power dynamics in international partnerships, this article promotes the development of ethical and equitable collaborations. We advocate for integrating cultural competence, epistemic plurality, and leadership skills into HPE curricula to prepare future healthcare professionals for effective international collaboration.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to develop an analytical framework toward facilitating the quantitative measurement of interdisciplinary understanding regarding sustainable energy systems with an application in the area of capacity-building projects in higher education. Design/methodology/approach The analytical framework is developed using the portfolio representation measurement approach in combination with a survey questionnaire. The subsequent assessment is carried out using the statistical measure of mean signed deviation to capture variation from an established baseline across the project group and visualized via radar diagrams. Findings The results provide a quantitative assessment framework for evaluating the degree of interdisciplinary understanding in the project groups. The application of the framework to the DESIRE project indicates the most significant degree of variation across economic and regulatory dimensions of sustainability. Discrepancies in general and educational contexts are observed. Research limitations/implications The exploitable value of the results is sensitive to the derivation of composite indicators of the dimensions defined as well as the survey design. The case study was carried out on an ex-post basis, potentially biasing the results reported and limiting their interpretability and theoretical value. Practical implications The analytical framework can be used as a basis for assessing and engaging in discussions on interdisciplinarity understanding at the outset of capacity-building projects. Originality/value The contribution of this paper is practical in scope and entails the development of a quantitative framework for measuring interdisciplinarity in the specific context of capacity-building projects in the field of sustainability research in higher education institutions.

AB  - Oceans play a vital role in socioeconomic and environmental development by supporting activities such as tourism, recreation, and food provision while providing important ecosystem services. However, concerns have been raised about the threat that climate change poses to the functions of oceans. This study examines the impacts, threats, and adaptation strategies of climate change and marine biodiversity. Using bibliometric and secondary data analysis, this study determines that climate change leads to rising sea temperatures, marine heatwaves, acidification, and increasing sea levels. These factors undermine the significance of ocean ecosystem services. This study also identifies the significant risks posed by climate change to marine species diversity and distribution, primarily through habitat degradation and shifts in species ranges. Scholarly focus on these challenges has grown over time, focusing on adaptation strategies and building resilience to mitigate adverse impacts. This study critically evaluates various adaptation measures, including nature-based and human-based solutions such as habitat restoration, policy and legislative frameworks, and their potential to protect marine ecosystems. It provides detailed discussions on the effectiveness of adaptation strategies such as marine protected areas (MPAs), mangrove and coral reef restoration, and species range shifts. This review also emphasises the significance of indigenous knowledge systems and community participation in marine conservation efforts to achieve holistic and sustainable management. It highlights the need for enhanced international cooperation and a transdisciplinary approach to address the complex interplay between climate change and marine biodiversity. Additionally, this study suggests that funding for research gaps and conservation can be secured through tourism revenue and other climate funding mechanisms.

AB  - Sustainable value chain management (SVCM) incorporates the social, economic, and environmental aspects (known as the triple-bottom-line) of production systems, offering significant potential for sustainable operations. By broadening system boundaries and including triple-bottom-line sustainability indicators, SVCM can improve the existing literature on sustainable operations management. Life cycle sustainability assessment (LCSA) identifies sustainability hotspots within value chains but is often underutilized in the practical design of sustainable operations. This paper presents a three-phase framework that combines SVCM and LCSA to enhance sustainable operations, using electricity production as a case study due to its substantial carbon footprint. The authors reviewed 443 articles from an initial 1649 documents on electricity production technologies, emphasizing the use of life cycle assessment (LCA) models to achieve responsible operations in the energy sector. The study highlights the benefits of the proposed integrated framework in achieving sustainable operations through sustainability reporting, stakeholder engagement, transparent procurement, global value chain management, corporate social responsibility, integrated decision-making, circular economy, and carbon footprint management. Future research should focus on developing circular production systems, integrating socioeconomic indicators, and aligning sustainable development goals with value chain hotspots.

AB  - The previous researches on sustainability evaluation for the mining sector indicate that the tailor-made integrated frameworks should have the capabilities of integrating the stakeholder-focused information as effectively as operational information into the evaluation and reporting process. In this regard, this paper proposes an indicator-based quantitative evaluation framework for integrating the concerns and priorities of the local stakeholders into the evaluation of sustainability in the mining sector operations and/or plans. The proposed framework allows one for assessing how the sustainability evaluation outcomes may differ if the project specific concerns and priorities are determined by the local stakeholders or by the operational reporting party, like the mining company or the planning authority. The proposed framework is implemented with the case study of Afsin-Elbistan Coal Basin (AECB) in Turkey. The future mine plan alternatives and current operations in AECB are evaluated and compared in terms of locals' and decision-makers' sustainability criteria. The results of the study show that the level of sustainability in the AECB, in other words, the contribution of the mining sector operations to sustainable development in the AECB diverse considerably based on the used sustainability criteria for the analysis. Therefore, consideration of the local sustainability criteria is necessary in order to prevent the unsound actions in terms of sustainability and contribute the sustainable development at the local-level.

AB  - Culture is the life blood of a society, which influences people's worldviews, values, and behaviours. Research has confirmed that children's participation in culture helps develop thinking skills, builds self-esteem, and improves resilience. This paper aims to explore how a purposely designed project can foster cultural sustainability through a case study of a neighbourhood project conducted in Chinese and Norwegian kindergartens. A qualitative research methodology is utilised. Major data sources are an overall project plan prepared by one of the Norwegian university researchers, project descriptions and PowerPoint presentations from the kindergartens, as well as workshop notes taken by one researcher during the workshop, complemented and triangulated by the follow-up reflective narratives from three kindergartens. Qualitative content analysis and comparative analysis are used to analyse the collected data. Findings have indicated that kindergartens hold similar views on culture and cultural stainability. Though the actual activities are diverse and implemented in different ways, the goal of fostering cultural sustainability is achieved in all participating kindergartens. Children not only have gained knowledge of their neighbourhood and problem solving and social skills but also have developed sense of belonging and emotional link with their local culture through the active participation. More importantly, this study has indicated that purposely designed projects/activities can promote early childhood education for sustainability and quality of early childhood education. It is thus recommended cultivating student teachers' and kindergarten teachers' competence to design projects/activities integrating different dimensions of sustainability in early childhood teacher education

AB  - In Africa, farm advisory services are still dominated by the model of technology transfer. During the last two decades a new approach, based on adult learning methods, has been successfully introduced (Management Advice for Family Farms, or MAAF). The current challenge is to improve access to and the institutional and financial sustainability of MAFF. To this end, we conducted a participatory evaluation of existing MAFF services using four criteria: governance, funding modalities, capacity of advisors and adaptation of the method. We found that the main constraint to scaling MAFF is institutional. Giving producers' organisations a greater say in governance would facilitate more appropriate advice, reduce costs and strengthen the services' sustainability beyond project-level investments.

AB  - Implementing payments for ecosystem service (PES) programs in national parks has proven effective in balancing the conflicts between ecosystem conservation and economic development, achieving long-term sustainability. Residents' participation and financial contributions are crucial prerequisites for establishing PES programs in national parks. Hence, it is necessary to investigate residents' willingness to participate in and pay before its official operation in China's Qinling National Park. By adopting a contingent valuation method, this study collects 1431 face-to-face, one-to-one questionnaire answers from rural residents in the region. The results show that 76.7% of the sample are willing to participate in the ecosystem conservation of Qinling National Park, although their willingness to pay is relatively low, with the average being RMB 136.5 (USD 20.3) per household per year. Moreover, informal institutions maintained by social trust continue to play an essential role in this rural area. Residents' willingness to participate is positively influenced by their social trust, which includes both institutional and interpersonal trust. Additionally, their willingness to pay is positively affected by their household income and cultural preferences. Finally, residents' occupation as farmers exhibits a negative moderating effect on the direct influence of their household income on their willingness to pay, while their education level positively moderates the impact of their cultural preferences on their willingness to pay.

AB  - Australia is considered world-leading in sustainable fisheries management. Despite this, public perceptions and trust in how fisheries are managed vary widely. Existing models of trust and community acceptance in extractive industries suggest transparently reporting on a wider range of sustainability issues than resource use and condition levels, or the status of target stocks in the case of fisheries, as a potential way to build public awareness and trust. Public perceptions of sustainability can be narrow or broad and related to different world views and perspectives about what is important. Here we investigate whether approaches such as Australia's conceptual 'Flealthcheck' framework for fisheries sustainability reporting, could contribute to increasing public trust in fishery management. Interviews with 21 people who currently use (or would use) fisheries information in their professional work revealed interest in a wide range of sustainability issues and a desire for more easily accessible and trusted information. The interviews also revealed four common themes: Trust and distrust; Sustainability concerns and interpretations; Conflicts and values; and Fisheries information sources and knowledge gaps. These themes emphasise the need to take a broad view of sustainability and communication in fishery management, across the range of actors involved, to collaborate widely and build more engagement and relationships with the public in different forms. We use these findings to propose how the established model of trust and community acceptance of natural resource-based sectors could be applied to commercial fisheries and relate to other initiatives, such as the Sustainable Development Goals.

AB  - Recent years have seen a proliferation of studies that use archetype analysis to better understand and to foster transitions toward sustainability. This growing literature reveals a common methodological ground, as well as a variety of perspectives and practices. In this paper, we provide an historical overview of the roots of archetype analysis from ancient philosophy to recent sustainability science. We thereby derive core features of the archetype approach, which we frame by eight propositions. We then introduce the Special Feature, "Archetype Analysis in Sustainability Research," which offers a consolidated understanding of the approach, a portfolio of methods, and quality criteria, as well as cutting-edge applications. By reflecting on the Special Feature's empirical and methodological contributions, we hope that the showcased advances, exemplary applications, and conceptual clarifications will help to design future research that contributes to collaborative learning on archetypical patterns leading toward sustainability. The paper concludes with an outlook highlighting central directions for the next wave of archetype analyses.

AB  - This study aims to develop a framework to understand the effect of sustainable manufacturing (SM) adoption in Indian textile industries. The survey-based methodology has been used to fulfill the objective of the study. Hence this study develops an instrument/questionnaire construct on the most accepted principle of instrument design to assess the various factors such as SMEs, SM barriers, solutions to overcome the barriers, and SM per-formance factors through the responses collected from 64 Indian textile industries. These factors have been found through extensive literature review and expert consultation. The SPSS 18.0 software has been used for the analysis of the responses. The reliability, normality, and validity of the developed instrument/question-naire were determined and are found to be acceptable for most SMEs. The framework can be used by industry professionals in the Indian textile industry. The industry practitioners can easily evaluate and select sustainable manufacturing based on the importance level of the identified factors through this study. Further, this research may be needed to confirm these results from larger data sets. It is necessary for organizations to trust their man-ufacturer for their survival and to gain a competitive advantage.

AB  - The food system is unsustainable and requires reconfiguration, however more data is required to assess the impacts of action which might contribute to a more sustainable food future. Responding to this, extensive research with food sharing initiatives-activities which have been flagged for their potential sustainability credentials-led to the co-design of an online sustainability impact assessment (SIA) tool to support food sharing initiatives to asses and evidence their sustainability impacts. This paper reports on the initial user testing of the resulting online tool: The Toolshed which forms the indicator based SIA element of the SHARE IT platform. Feedback gathered from the initiatives testing the tool are analyzed and summaries of their reported impacts detailed. This analysis confirms the need for the tool, the relevance of the indicators included and the value of SIA reports for internal reflection and external communication. Nonetheless, challenges remain in relation to resourcing the practice of SIA reporting. We conclude with a plan for expanding engagement with The Toolshed and the wider SHARE IT platform.

AB  - Livestock production systems are associated with climate change, land degradation, and animal welfare concerns, while overconsumption of animal-sourced foods is a major driver of human disease. Thus, shifting towards plantrich diets is expected to deliver benefits for human health, the environment, and animal welfare. Nevertheless, diets high in animal products are flourishing, especially in high-income countries. Here, we take a novel interdisciplinary approach to evaluating sustainability of diets by assessing five common plant-rich diets (Mediterranean, flexitarian/semi-vegetarian, vegan, vegetarian, and pescatarian) on two metrics. First, we established each diet's environmental, human health, and animal welfare impacts, using quantitative data sourced from a review of the literature, including life cycle assessments. Second, we evaluated the human factor by surveying current consumer dietary preferences (i.e., which diet participants had followed over the past week) and the likelihood of adopting each plant-rich diet in the future, among a sample of Australian adults (n = 253). Combining the results from the review and the survey in a Behavior Prioritization Matrix (BPM), the Mediterranean diet was shown to have the greatest projected positive impact, followed by the vegetarian diet. This study is the first to combine assessments of sustainable diets on the three dimensions of environment, human health, and animal welfare with probability of adoption. Our findings highlight the necessity of assessing plant-rich diets through a holistic lens when identifying target diets to promote, in order to support sustainable food systems in highincome countries.

AB  - In the realm of organizational cooperation, the choice of benefit behaviors has a profound impact on the sustainability of the collaboration. The influence of trust relationships on firms' decisions regarding private versus common benefit behaviors has been a subject of debate among researchers. To address this debate, we propose and test an analytical framework that acknowledges the presence of two fundamental dimensions in partner relationships: calculative trust and relational trust. Through the utilization of a policy-capturing approach, we rigorously examine and validate our hypotheses at a mechanistic level. Our findings indicate that both calculative trust and relational trust increase the likelihood of firms adopting both private and common benefit behaviors. Furthermore, in terms of comparative choices between private and common benefit behaviors, calculative trust exerts a stronger influence on firms' preference for private benefit, while relational trust has a stronger impact on firms' preference for common benefit. Lastly, we discuss the theoretical and empirical implications arising from the results of this study.

AB  - There is an urgent need for countries to transition their national food and land-use systems toward food and nutritional security, climate stability, and environmental integrity. How can countries satisfy their demands while jointly delivering the required transformative change to achieve global sustainability targets? Here, we present a collaborative approach developed with the FABLE-Food, Agriculture, Biodiversity, Land, and Energy-Consortium to reconcile both global and national elements for developing national food and land-use system pathways. This approach includes three key features: (1) global targets, (2) country-driven multi-objective pathways, and (3) multiple iterations of pathway refinement informed by both national and international impacts. This approach strengthens policy coherence and highlights where greater national and international ambition is needed to achieve global goals (e.g., the SDGs). We discuss how this could be used to support future climate and biodiversity negotiations and what further developments would be needed.

AB  - This study analyzes the influence of supply chain integration dimensions (internal integration and external integration) on the product innovation capability (market knowledge and product development) and operational performance of manufacturing firms, considering product innovation capability as a mediator. A purposive sampling method was used, and data were collected through a survey completed by 129 medium and large manufacturers in Pakistan and analyzed using the structural equation modeling technique. The results show internal and customer integrations are not directly related to operational performance. Furthermore, supplier integration was positively related to both product innovation capability and operational performance. Likewise, the link between product innovation capability and operational performance is positive. The study uniquely evaluates that product innovation capability positively mediates the impacts of internal and external integration on operational performance. The outcomes of this study will help managers of manufacturing firms boost their firms' product innovation capability and operational performance by focusing on supply chain integration. Moreover, to achieve sustainability in the supply chain, practitioners are provided with directions on operationalizing supply chain integration. The study uniquely identifies the mediation effects of product innovation capability (market knowledge and product development) between internal and external integration and operational performance.

AB  - Rangeland restoration in southern Africa faces complex challenges that require the involvement of diverse social groups to ensure both ecological and social sustainability. This systematic review focuses on the role of social inclusion in rangeland restoration across multiple countries in the region, specifically examining the engagement of marginalized groups such as women, youth, and indigenous communities. We conducted a comprehensive search using the PRISMA approach, utilizing Scopus and other literature sources. Initially, we found 853 articles published between 2000 and 2024, which were subsequently screened down to 20 studies that met stringent inclusion criteria. This review identifies key strategies and outcomes associated with social inclusion in restoration efforts. Our findings reveal that participatory planning, gender-inclusive strategies, indigenous engagement, and capacity building are crucial for gaining community support, promoting social equity, and enhancing ecological resilience. However, challenges such as power dynamics, cultural norms, and resource constraints often impede the full realization of these inclusive practices. Despite these barriers, integrating local and indigenous knowledge and empowering marginalized groups significantly strengthens governance structures and leads to more sustainable restoration outcomes. Our review highlights the necessity of adopting holistic and inclusive approaches in rangeland restoration where social inclusion is not just a component but a central pillar of successful ecological management. It emphasizes the importance of social inclusion in the restoration of communal rangelands in southern Africa and provides insights into the approaches used, challenges faced, and outcomes achieved in incorporating social inclusion in rangeland restoration efforts. Our findings underscore the significance of collaborative efforts and social inclusion among local communities, policymakers, and stakeholders to achieve the sustainable restoration of communal rangelands in southern Africa.

AB  - Our study analyzes the effectiveness of two sustainable supply management practices (i.e., assessment and collaboration) on achieving a socially responsible supply chain. Based on data from 120 Spanish manufacturers the paper investigates the impact that both practices have on the buying firm's and the supplier's social performances. SmartPLS was used to test the hypothesized relationships between practices and performance. Our results suggest that while assessing suppliers contributes to improve the buying firm's social performance, collaborating with them enhances the suppliers' social performance. Furthermore, the paper provides some additional insights on how to measure social performance. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - How student voice is viewed is complex. Increasingly, effort has been made to include student voice in teaching and learning, with student voice positioned in different ways, from the instrumental to the transformative. The success and sustainability of student voice efforts require a more critical understanding of the participatory efforts of both teachers and students, as well as the interplay between teachers' and students' voices. Using a case-study approach, within an interpretive paradigm, this study explores teachers' and students' discourses on student voice at the beginning of a larger study situated within five English Language classrooms in Singapore. The findings highlight the discursive framings of both teachers and students and foreground spaces of convergence and divergence. Both teachers and students share similar views on the possibilities and promises of student voice in teaching and learning, which centred largely around pedagogic and performative reasons. The data also revealed a shared sense of vulnerability and fear, surfacing real, yet tacit and lesser known boundaries and issues which both teachers and students see as affecting student voice efforts. The findings suggest that student voice work needs to be situated in an environment of trust and authentic listening to harness its potential.

AB  - The university is a key agent in the process of transformation towards sustainability within the framework of the 2030 Agenda. This study aims to analyze the usefulness of the collaborative learning methodology through a serious game (SG) in the university environment to increase the level of knowledge and the importance given to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by students. Through ex ante and ex post questionnaires, the degree of variation in the knowledge acquired and importance given to the SDGs was measured. To compare the midrange of these two samples and determine whether differences existed, we applied the Student and Wilcoxont-tests. The results indicate that the methodology used produced an improvement in knowledge about the SDGs. Therefore, it is concluded that the university should promote this type of workshop and SG activities to contribute to the achievement of the SDGs, both in the Bachelor's Degree in Primary Education and in degrees of other disciplines. Moreover, we have encouraged active learning of the SDGs through collaborative workshops using the design thinking method and an SG called "The Island", which, based on certain economic, social and environmental information, puts students in a position to govern resources to meet the needs of its population.

AB  - Ecological restoration is a suitable tool to revert land degradation in semiarid areas. Social participation is increasingly considered as a guarantee for the long-term success and sustainability of restoration projects. In rural areas of North African countries, experiences of participatory restoration are still not frequent, and poverty and illiteracy with top-down approaches boost land-use conflicts and raise skepticism toward restoration programs. We developed a framework for forest restoration based on knowledge share, trust, and active stakeholder participation in all restoration steps. The framework was tested through a demonstrative project aimed at restoring Tetraclinis articulata forests in a semiarid area of North Morocco, in which scientists, managers, and local stakeholders were involved in all steps of the restoration process: identification of restoration priorities, assessment of land-use options, definition of the restoration procedure, participatory plantation, evaluation, surveillance, and monitoring. In a 1 ha plot, 250 plants were planted by 90 participants in a spirit of knowledge exchange, mutual aid, environmental education, and social solidarity. After 2 years, the plot remains intact, free of any act of vandalism and grazing, and shows signals of improved ecosystem functioning. A wider application of the proposed framework in current restoration strategies will enhance our understanding of the factors behind social acceptance and support for restoration projects.

AB  - This study attempted to evaluate the learning effectiveness of using the MIT App Inventor platform and its Personal Image Classifier (PIC) tool in the interdisciplinary application. The instructional design was focused on applying PIC in the integration of STEAM (i.e., Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Mathematics) interdisciplinary learning, so as to provide sustainable and suitable teaching content based on the experiential learning theory for 7th grader students. Accordingly, the sustainable AI-STEAM course with the experiential learning framework has been implemented and verified, so as to confirm that the AI-STEAM course is not too difficult for young students. Many basic concepts involved in the AI-STEAM course, regarding programming logic, electromechanical concepts, interface design, and the application of image recognition, were measured in this study. The results showed that the students not only made significant progress in learning effectiveness, but also in particular made significant improvements in two parts: electromechanical concepts and image recognition knowledge. In the end, this study further provides some advice on the sustainable AI-STEAM course based on the survey of some important factors including active learning, and self-efficacy after confirming that it is not a barrier for the young students to learn the sustainable AI-STEAM course developed in this study.

AB  - Chemistry is the central science for value creation by physical products in the socio-economic system. Unsustainable processes over many decades have led to pressure on the planet and an urgent need for prioritizing sustainable development on a global level. Due to the central role of chemistry, the chemistry profession is an important stakeholder group to shape the transformation towards sustainable development. In order to provide relevant skills, higher education in chemistry requires a view of chemistry in the context of the framework of sustainability and the uptake of new content that is not covered in conventional teaching of chemistry. Such content includes environmental chemistry and toxicology, benign design of chemicals (teaching of chemistry), but also a broader context such as alternative business models and overarching knowledge of international policies and strategies to implement change with respect to chemical industry, chemical products and business (teaching about chemistry) in favor of sustainable development. In this paper, we describe a first of its kind program following this approach: An M.Sc. Sustainable Chemistry. It addresses the above mentioned topics and aims for international professionals of the chemical sector.

AB  - Human actions have driven earth systems close to irreversible and profound change. The need to shift towards intentional transformative adaptation (ITA) is clear. Using case studies from the Transformative Adaptation Research Alliance (TARA), we explore ITA as a way of thinking and acting that is transformative in concept and objectives, but achieved through a mix of incremental and transformative co-production processes that ultimately lead to the social-ecological system being transformed. Central to ITA are social and political issues of how individuals and collectives address environmental and social change and deal with power imbalances. ITA approaches are claimed to help overcome adaptation challenges, including: 1) re-framing human-nature relationships; 2) dealing with uncertainty; 3) engendering empowerment and agency and 4) addressing conflicting values and interests. However, it is unclear if these approaches work in practice. We examined six adaptation case studies in which participants used processes of: 1) co-producing visions of the future; 2) re-framing values, rules and knowledge to shift decision contexts for adaptation and 3) implementing actions using theories of change and adaptation pathways. We assessed the extent to which participants could use these processes to address their adaptation challenges. We found evidence of many positive achievements towards the implementation of ITA, but also examples where processes were not working, such as communities having difficulties in finding ways to work co-operatively. Different processes will be needed to address these issues, such as promoting pluralism, knowledge contestation, and deliberative re-politicisation of the adaptation agenda to shift power imbalances and enable change.

AB  - How can buildings be combined with agricultural production and what are the major potential benefits and challenges for the introduction of zero-acreage farming (ZFarming) in Berlin from the relevant stakeholders' perspectives? These questions were explored through a series of interviews and stakeholder workshops held between 2011 and 2013. The aim was to identify the most suitable building-integrated farming model for the Berlin metropolitan area and to develop guidelines for the model's successful and sustainable implementation through a stakeholder-driven approach. This paper provides an aggregated synthesis of the outcomes derived from the qualitative interviews and stakeholder workshops. As the results reveal, the stakeholders perceive potential benefits and challenges related to the issue of ZFarming in all dimensions (economic, social, environmental and political). They largely agreed on the importance of focusing on local resources, using energy-efficient production-including social and educational aspects-and developing new market structures when introducing ZFarming to the city of Berlin. The stakeholders identified urban rooftop greenhouses (RTG) as the most promising farming model for Berlin. In a joint collaboration of all stakeholders, a manual for RTG was developed within the participatory innovation process that addresses the identified problems and challenges associated with future implementation and governance of RTG in Berlin and beyond.

AB  - Transformative changes in agriculture at multiple scales are needed to ensure sustainability, i.e. achieving food security while fostering social justice and environmental integrity. These transformations go beyond technological fixes and require fundamental changes in cognitive, relational, structural and functional aspects of agricultural systems. However, research on agricultural transformations fails to engage deeply with underlying social aspects such as differing perceptions of sustainability, uncertainties and ambiguities, politics of knowledge, power imbalances and deficits in democracy. In this paper, we suggest that conflict is one manifestation of such underlying social aspects. We present an original conceptualization and analytical framework, wherein conflict is recognized as an important motor for redistribution of power and leverage for social learning that-if addressed through a conflict transformation process-could potentially create a step-change in agricultural transformation towards greater sustainability. Our analysis, building on an extensive literature review and empirical case studies from around the world, suggests a novel approach to guide future transdisciplinary research that can support agricultural transformations towards sustainability.

AB  - We studied public perceptions of what climate actions are needed, which actors should and can act, and which factors inhibit or enable those actions using the naturally occurring discourse on climate actions on Twitter during COP26. By incorporating big data computational methods with a theory-based qualitative analysis, we aimed to identify climate actions and actors at the international, national, local, and individual levels, and systematically evaluate the perceived barriers and enablers in taking action and related public sentiments. We find that political and industry leaders are widely perceived as the most responsible and capable of taking action. Yet, their current inaction is perceived as inhibiting net-zero transitions and triggers anger, fear, and blame. In contrast, discourse on citizens and local communities demonstrates hope and solidarity in enacting pro-environmental changes from the bottom up, signaling strong public demand for ambitious climate policies and actions. These findings highlight the importance of removing institutional barriers and catalyzing socio-cultural support to accelerate collective climate progress. Overall, our mixed-method approach provides a more comprehensive understanding of how to step up societal-wide climate actions, paving the way for much-needed communications and collaborations across society to achieve a sustainable future.

AB  - Due to environmental and social problems with suppliers, companies have included sustainability criteria in their supplier evaluation. However, there is little research on the application of environmental and social criteria and related purchasing practices. Therefore, the objective of this study was to examine how companies apply environmental and social criteria in supplier evaluation. Interviews with purchasing experts from the fashion and apparel industry were conducted. The results indicate that no child labour, working hours, no forced labour, no discrimination, employment compensation, freedom of association, and health and safety practices are commonly used as social criteria, whereas end-of-pipe control (wastewater treatment systems) and environmentally friendly materials are used as environmental criteria. New criteria, for example, housing conditions and home worker conditions, were identified as not having been suggested in the literature on supplier evaluation. The discussion herein examines the application and the importance of sustainability criteria in the supplier evaluation process. Environmental and social criteria are applied in pre-qualification as well as verification of the compliance of the purchasing requirements in supplier controlling. However, these criteria are not important in the final selection of a supplier for an order as is often recommended in the literature. Consequently, sustainability criteria are indeed important for supplier evaluation but do not carry the same importance that many papers assign them. The research findings contribute to the literature on sustainable supply chain management with empirical insights about the application and importance of environmental and social criteria in supplier evaluation. Furthermore, the identified sustainability criteria can be used by practitioners to improve supplier evaluation efforts. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - PurposeIn a context of growing concern about the environmental and social crisis, education for sustainability has emerged as a key educational approach to address these challenges. University education plays a crucial role in training professionals who are aware of and committed to sustainability. This study aims to examine the impact of the socio-professional characteristics of university professors on the awareness and implementation of sustainability in teaching and research.Design/methodology/approachThis study uses the academics' statements through a survey to describe the degree of awareness and implementation of sustainability at the University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU) and evaluates the influence that certain socio-professional variables can have on their commitment to sustainability. For this purpose, the paper proposes the use of descriptive and inferential statistical techniques.FindingsThe research reveals that UPV/EHU is in the first phases of implementation of sustainability, indicating a low overall implementation. Therefore, it is proposed to promote internal awareness about sustainability, promote teacher training, integrate sustainability competencies in academic programs and promote research in areas with less scientific production related to sustainability, with emphasis on interdisciplinary collaboration and gender equality to achieve greater integration of sustainability in the university. In the case of the UPV/EHU, the sustainable development champions fulfill the profile of a female professor, with full-time dedication and whose disciplinary area is a minority.Research limitations/implicationsThis research has an individual framework and a static nature, and the results should be interpreted only in their context. Future research should have a national framework, a longitudinal nature and a broader range of university institutional agents. Another limitation of this methodology is the question coding process (Likert scales), which opens a wide range of subjectivity for the researcher.Originality/valueTo the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study that measures the degree of implementation of sustainability at the UPV/EHU with the aim of specifying its efforts in the implementation and promotion of sustainability.

AB  - Electrochemistry has the potential to sustainably transform molecules with electrons supplied by renewable electricity. It is one of many solutions towards a more circular, sustainable and equitable society. To achieve this, collaboration between industry and research laboratories is a must. Atomistic understanding from fundamental experiments and modelling can be used to engineer optimized systems whereas limitations set by the scaled-up technology can direct the systems studied in the research laboratory. In this Primer, best practices to run clean laboratory-scale electrochemical systems and tips for the analysis of electrochemical data to improve accuracy and reproducibility are introduced. How characterization and modelling are indispensable in providing routes to garner further insights into atomistic and mechanistic details is discussed. Finally, important considerations regarding material and cell design for scaling up water electrolysis are highlighted and the role of hydrogen in our society's energy transition is discussed. The future of electrochemistry is bright and major breakthroughs will come with rigour and improvements in the collection, analysis, benchmarking and reporting of electrochemical water splitting data.

AB  - The paired assistance approach is an important measure for achieving poverty alleviation in China. The sustainable development of poverty-stricken areas after poverty alleviation has become an important task in preventing a return to poverty and promoting rural revitalization. Paired assistance is a dynamic process of balanced economic, social, and population development. This study establishes a system dynamics (SD) model for developing poverty-stricken regions under paired assistance. This study takes Lvchun County in Yunnan Province as the research object, designates six scenarios, and simulates the development of Lvchun County from 2019 to 2035 to evaluate its sustainable development after poverty alleviation. The results show that the cessation of poverty alleviation funding will not increase the incidence of poverty under paired assistance but will lead to an unbalanced scenario of "poor people and a rich government". In the multi-scenario simulation, only by continuing the cooperation foundation formed by paired assistance and paying attention to the resource endowment of poverty-stricken areas can collaborative development be adopted to achieve sustainable development by 2030. This result may be a valuable resource for the world's underdeveloped regions to reference as they seek to eliminate poverty, reduce the risk of returning to poverty, and promote sustainable development.

AB  - A growing world population and rapid expansion of cities increase the pressure on basic resources such as water, food and energy. To safeguard the provision of these resources, restoration and sustainable management of landscapes is pivotal, including sustainable forest and water management. Sustainable forest management includes forest conservation, restoration, forestry and agroforestry practices. Interlinkages between forests and water are fundamental to moderate water budgets, stabilize runoff, reduce erosion and improve biodiversity and water quality. Sweden has gained substantial experience in sustainable forest management in the past century. Through significant restoration efforts, a largely depleted Swedish forest has transformed into a well-managed production forest within a century, leading to sustainable economic growth through the provision of forest products. More recently, ecosystem services are also included in management decisions. Such a transformation depends on broad stakeholder dialog, combined with an enabling institutional and policy environment. Based on seminars and workshops with a wide range of key stakeholders managing Sweden's forests and waters, this article draws lessons from the history of forest management in Sweden. These lessons are particularly relevant for countries in the Global South that currently experience similar challenges in forest and landscape management. The authors argue that an integrated landscape approach involving a broad array of sectors and stakeholders is needed to achieve sustainable forest and water management. Sustainable landscape management-integrating water, agriculture and forests-is imperative to achieving resilient socio-economic systems and landscapes.

T2  - HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS
LA  - English
KW  - SOFT POWER
AB  - The present study aims to explore the current model of communication applied between critical stakeholders such as the government and private sector engaged in public diplomacy efforts for promoting or improving the country's reputation to the foreign public. A literature review shows that the current communication model applied by the mentioned stakeholders is based on the transmission model, which, to be successful, relies on an ideal version of the communication process where the message gets clearly through the channel while assuming the receiver's understanding is as close as it gets to the sender's intention. This process, however, omits communication complexities that derive from such a process where new social realities are being co-created by stakeholders. Consequently, the authors argue that there is a need to introduce a communication model that enables stakeholders to achieve a more sustainable coordination-focused outcome that would benefit both government and the private sector. The methodology is based on the Coordinated Management of Meaning (CMM) theoretical framework that helps identify the current transmission-based public diplomacy communication model while recommending a new model based on a communication perspective. Finally, a communication model is created to describe the needed shift from the current traditional public diplomacy communication process (based on the transmission model) to the one suggested by CMM. Further research is needed where the actual CMM-based communication model will be applied by stakeholders and adequately monitored and evaluated.

AB  - Localising the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is often associated with the act of localising goals, targets and indicators, as well as the activities to measure and monitor progress. However, local communities worldwide are starting to engage with the SDGs by other means, for example, by incorporating the SDGs into local governance. In these efforts to make the SDGs part of an existing local governance process, which we call SDG engagement, the SDGs can be valued differently. They can be valued for their potential to support a widespread and fundamental change in society (the SDG transformative potential) or for their moderate addition to ongoing practices and activities (the SDG conventional value). Currently, how local governments can engage with the SDGs in different local governance activities is underexplored. This study introduces eight modes through which local governments can engage with the SDGs in local governance and discuss the unique transformative potential of those engagements via synthesising knowledge across 14 empirical studies of local communities in Australia. Building on the findings of this study, we propose a framework to aid SDG engagement in local governance activities, highlighting the transformative potential of the engagements. The study highlights the need for future explorations on the opportunities to enact a deliberate and more ambitious transformation driven by governance institutions.

AB  - Purpose With increasing demands placed on Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) to engage with the Sustainable Development (SD) needs of its local communities, Community-Engaged Teaching and Learning (CETL) has emerged as a valuable tool to help HEIs cater to such demands. This study aims to explore and examine CETL practices at HEIs across the globe, particularly in relation to its role in furthering the SD agenda. Design/methodology/approach This study adopts an extensive review of academic literature as an investigative tool to probe different CETL approaches being practiced by HEIs, especially the ones aligned with sustainability. Findings The study revealed discernible findings on four aspects: (i) curricular strategies and pedagogical interventions adopted under the ambit of CETL for advancing the SD agenda, (ii) engagement and sustainability linked competencies and learning outcomes derived in the process, (iii) challenges constraining CETL practices at HEIs, and (iv) strategies for strengthening the same and ensuring its impactful implementation. Originality/value This study accrues value in illuminating the practice, role, impact and implications of SD oriented CETL practices, given that there are limited studies on the subject. It also contributes to the global call for HEIs to catalyze sustainable social development by making their teaching and learning functions more community-engaged and socially relevant.

AB  - This paper reflects upon the potential of real-world laboratories (RWLs) to promote sustainable urban development. RWLs strive for knowledge production through collective action in experimental settings. Their implementation in urban studies faces two major challenges: (1) the ambiguity of roles university researchers need to fill, and (2) the variety of expectations among team members from different institutional backgrounds. Based on research in one trans-European and three German RWLs, we propose a stronger focus on team development to help researchers in RWLs address these challenges more systematically. In particular, this means support in terms of resources and infrastructure (time, space, and training). We argue that the improvement of RWL team performance has great impact on the potentials of RWLs in transformative urban studies. Thus, the article contributes to the ongoing debate on the city as a laboratory and site of experimentation in times of multiple crises.

AB  - Sustainability indicators are well recognized for their potential to assess and monitor sustainable development of agricultural systems. A large number of indicators are proposed in various sustainability assessment frameworks, which raises concerns regarding the validity of approaches, usefulness and trust in such frameworks. Selecting indicators requires transparent and well-defined procedures to ensure the relevance and validity of sustainability assessments. The objective of this study, therefore, was to determine whether experts agree on which criteria are most important in the selection of indicators and indicator sets for robust sustainability assessments. Two groups of experts (Temperate Agriculture Research Network and New Zealand Sustainability Dashboard) were asked to rank the relative importance of eleven criteria for selecting individual indicators and of nine criteria for balancing a collective set of indicators. Both ranking surveys reveal a startling lack of consensus amongst experts about how best to measure agricultural sustainability and call for a radical rethink about how complementary approaches to sustainability assessments are used alongside each other to ensure a plurality of views and maximum collaboration and trust amongst stakeholders. To improve the transparency, relevance and robustness of sustainable assessments, the context of the sustainability assessment, including prioritizations of selection criteria for indicator selection, must be accounted for. A collaborative design process will enhance the acceptance of diverse values and prioritizations embedded in sustainability assessments. The process by which indicators and sustainability frameworks are established may be a much more important determinant of their success than the final shape of the assessment tools. Such an emphasis on process would make assessments more transparent, transformative and enduring.

AB  - In wildlife management, differing perspectives among stakeholders generate conflicts about how to achieve disparate sustainability goals that include ecological, economic, and sociocultural dimensions. To mitigate such conflicts, decisions regarding wildlife management must be taken thoughtfully. To our knowledge, there exists no integrative modeling framework to inform these decisions, considering all dimensions of sustainability. We constructed a decision-support tool based on stakeholder workshops and a Bayesian decision network to inform management of wild ruminants in the federal state of Lower Austria. We use collaborative decision analysis to compare resource allocations while accounting for trade-offs among dimensions of sustainability. The tool is designed for application by non-technical users across diverse decision-making contexts with particular sets of wildlife management actions, objectives, and uncertainties. Our tool represents an important step toward developing and evaluating a transparent and replicable approach for mitigating wildlife-based conflicts in Europe and beyond.

AB  - The growing awareness regarding environmental sustainability has fully reached business reality. Consumers and companies alike are looking for alternatives to mitigate pressing environmental demands resulting from continuous population and economic growth. On the other hand, companies must deal with an increasingly competitive scenario where innovation is regarded as a survival need in most markets. It is thus clear that systematic academic research is paramount to guide companies to succeed in environmentally sustainable product innovation. In this context, this paper (i) consolidate extant research and aggregate findings of different studies on environmentally sustainable product innovation through an interpretative framework of published literature on the topic, and (ii) map critical success factors that drive the success of product innovation developed in this new logic of production and consumption. To achieve these objectives, a systematic literature review on environmentally sustainable product innovation was conducted. Results show that there are four main critical success factors for environmentally sustainable product innovation: market, law and regulation knowledge; interfunctional collaboration; innovation-oriented learning; and R&D investments. The factors identified in this research and corresponding variables were subjected to a brief empirical test by professionals. The test allowed a preliminary approval of the developed framework and identification of the most important variables within each factor. A research agenda based on the state-of-the-art on the topic is also proposed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Participatory diagnosis is the methodological process through which society participates to undertake and achieve sustainable development with the contribution of science and collective knowledge. The objective of this research is to analyze the current situation of the Sierra de Guadalupe State Park (SGSP) in Mexico from the natural, historical, economic, and social aspects, through participatory research and thus influence the selection of trees and shrubs of multiple uses for reforestation that have the potential to establish agroforestry and silvopastoral systems. This study was carried out with the help of the following tools that are commonly used in a participatory diagnosis: participant observation and transects, SWOT analysis, timeline, and identification and classification of natural resources. To determine the current problems of the state park (SGSP), the "problem tree" method was used. A participatory workshop was held to identify solutions to these problems, assigning positive actions to negative conditions. In addition, 141 interviews were conducted with social actors involved in the study area using the "snowball" methodology. There are 72 and 44 species of wildlife and plants, respectively. Through participatory mapping, changes in the landscape and land use in the pre-Hispanic, colonial, and modern periods were identified, which allowed for the construction of a timeline. The priority forest species considered to initiate the restoration actions were: Prosopis laevigata, Vachellia schaffneri, and Quercus rugosa. The shrub species were: Opuntia tomentosa, Opuntia hyptiacantha, and Agave salmiana. In conclusion, with this study, reliable technical knowledge was generated with the participation of society, which will be used to carry out actions of protection, restoration, conservation, and productive reconversion.

AB  - This paper casts light on cultural heritage storytelling in the context of interactive documentary, a hybrid media genre that employs a full range of multimedia tools to document reality, provide sustainability of the production and successful engagement of the audience. The main research hypotheses are enclosed in the statements: (a) the interactive documentary is considered a valuable tool for the sustainability of cultural heritage and (b) digital approaches to documentary storytelling can provide a sustainable form of viewing during the years. Using the Greek interactive documentary (i-doc) NEW LIFE (2013) as a case study, the users' engagement is evaluated by analyzing items from a seven-year database of web metrics. Specifically, we explore the adopted ways of the interactive documentary users to engage with the storytelling, the depth to which they were involved along with the most popular sections/traffic sources and finally, the differences between the first launch period and latest years were investigated. We concluded that interactivity affordances of this genre enhance the social dimension of cultural, while the key factors for sustainability are mainly (a) constant promotion with transmedia approach; (b) data-driven evaluation and reform; and (c) a good story that gathers relevant niches, with specific interest to the story.

AB  - Acceptance by different stakeholder groups plays a crucial role for the success of voluntary sustainability certification schemes (CS). By including the demands of stakeholder groups, this study addresses this important dimension and makes an important contribution to the growing empirical and comparative research on the design characteristics of CS in the sector of mineral resources. By applying a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) the stakeholder demands placed on the design characteristics were modeled as weights. The CS Fairmined, Fairtrade, ASI and RJC meet the demands of all stakeholder groups because they perform well regarding all of the considered design characteristics. CS that were developed by representatives from the supply chain, the civil society and multiple groups noticeably better meet the demands of their broad underlying stakeholder groups whereas CS originating from mining representatives meet the demands of their stakeholder group less well. Furthermore, old CS meet the demands of certain stakeholder groups less well as they especially perform poorly in developing high quality traceability systems which might rely on a lacking experience of early CS in developing such complex systems. CS having an overarching mineral focus perform badly compared to CS with a specialized mineral focus in terms of meeting broad demands. CS might struggle when developing these design characteristics appropriately as the complexity of the design characteristics increases when focusing on several mineral resources. The results are useful for CS' representatives as the quality of design characteristics can be improved with regard to important stakeholders' demands and in the light of rival CS.

AB  - Indicator species have been used for several decades as measures of ecosystem health. In arid Australian rangelands, which are dominated by commercial grazing enterprises reliant on native pastures, the development of efficacious indicators is particularly important to monitor production and biodiversity values. The high temporal and spatial climatic variability of arid rangelands means that developing broad indicators is difficult and resource intensive. However, pastoralists, who observe their pastures and the species favoured by stock under a range of conditions, can provide information on local indicators. This paper examines pastoralists' knowledge in terms of its value for natural resource management in rangelands, including their use of local indicators and understanding of palatability of selected plant species. A survey was mailed to all 51 occupants of pastoral properties in the Stony Plains region of South Australia. Pastoralists were asked what species they considered indicators of overgrazing, whether they would destock if they noted changes in these indicators, what they knew of the palatability of certain plant species, and the usefulness of cracking-clay areas (a key landscape feature in the region) for grazing. Views of respondents on indicator species and plant palatability mostly concurred with published reports on the preferences of livestock for these species. A wide range of indicators (all perennial plant species and no animal species) was listed by respondents, suggesting that indicators are highly location-specific, plant-focussed, and not viewed consistently among pastoralists. Respondents related specific information about cracking-clay areas on their leases, including the influence of the timing and amount of rainfall on pasture productivity, and the value of these areas for livestock. It can be difficult for natural resource management practitioners, who may not observe the landscape regularly, to evaluate land condition and prescribe appropriate land management strategies. It is argued that the participation of pastoralists in science and policy development is fundamental to achieving sustainable land management, providing opportunities for social learning within an adaptive management framework.

AB  - This study investigated the influence of public relations (PR) strategies on stakeholder engagement and community participation in sustainable tourism policies in Tolitoli Regency, Central Sulawesi, Indonesia. This research addresses a significant gap in the literature regarding the application of PR strategies to sustainable tourism development, particularly in emerging tourism regions like Tolitoli. These areas, on the cusp of tourism development, face challenges in effectively engaging stakeholders and the community. Employing a qualitative case study approach, we examine how PR strategies affect the implementation of sustainable development policies in the local tourism sector. Through interviews with policymakers and stakeholders, focus groups with community members, and a review of PR materials, we selected 27 participants using purposive sampling, based on their relevance to the subject. Effective PR communication is pivotal for policy acceptance, aligning businesses with sustainability, and informing stakeholders and tourists of sustainable tourism. Community participation is transformative, stressing local involvement in culturally sensitive policies. Challenges include countering digital misinformation and balancing development with conservation efforts. Strategic PR is crucial for shaping positive destination images and educating people about the local culture and sustainability. This research provides guidelines for Tolitoli and similar regions, advocating PR training for sustainable tourism and crisis management with transparent communication. Acknowledging the potential variability in stakeholder perceptions and its focus on Tolitoli, this research's generalizability is limited. Future research should explore PR strategies in diverse settings to understand their long-term impacts and adapt to evolving stakeholder expectations for sustainable tourism.

AB  - Transformative research is a broad and loosely connected family of research disciplines and approaches, with the explicit normative ambition to fundamentally question the status quo, change the dominant structures, and support just sustainability transitions by working collaboratively with society. When engaging in such science-practice collaborations for transformative change in society, researchers experience ethical dilemmas. Amongst others, they must decide, what is worthwhile to be researched, whose reality is privileged, and whose knowledge is included. Yet, current institutionalised ethical standards, which largely follow the tradition of medical ethics, are insufficient to guide transformative researchers in navigating such dilemmas. In addressing this vacuum, the research community has started to develop peer guidance on what constitutes morally good behaviour. These formal and informal guidelines offer a repertoire to explain and justify positions and decisions. However, they are only helpful when they have become a part of researchers' practical knowledge 'in situ'. By focusing on situated research practices, the article addresses the need to develop an attitude of leaning into the uncertainty around what morally good behaviour constitutes. It also highlights the significance of combining this attitude with a critical reflexive practice both individually and collaboratively for answering questions around 'how to' as well as 'what is the right thing to do'. Using a collaborative autoethnographic approach, the authors of this paper share their own ethical dilemmas in doing transformative research, discuss those, and relate them to a practical heuristic encompassing axiological, ontological, and epistemological considerations. The aim is to support building practical wisdom for the broader research community about how to navigate ethical questions arising in transformative research practice.

AB  - Conservation science is a mission-driven discipline, yet there are few assessments on whether conservation practices follow scientific recommendations. Brazil has among the greatest gaps in species protection by marine protected areas (MPAs) globally and is thus a priority for future marine conservation efforts. In this paper, we assess the federal marine protected area (MPA) planning process in Brazil and compare it to a systematic conservation planning approach, focused on achieving conservation benefits while minimizing associated costs. We review the available information for all (70) federal MPAs, and the 26 associated management plans available. We found five simple opportunities for improving national MPA planning: (1) identifying specific and quantitative objectives and linking them to timeframes and budgets; (2) developing strategic monitoring and evaluation programs focused on MPA performance; (3) enabling local stakeholders to participate in planning processes, (4) explicitly considering MPA costs and leveraging existing sources of funding, and (5) decentralizing resource management and empowering local stakeholders to manage resources sustainably. Many reviewed MPA planning efforts fall short in providing clear management guidance and our recommendations can foster a stronger platform for the conservation and sustainable use of marine resources in Brazil.

AB  - Purpose: The article discusses the efficiency of state policy on the provision of a technological breakthrough in the Russian economy. Design/methodology/approach: Within the study, the authors have employed the methods of systemic, factor, functional, logical, comparative, and statistical analysis. On the back of the analysis, an integrated assessment of institutional and technological provision means of the Russian economy has been carried out. Findings: The authors have found out that the current system to manage and coordinate the performance of national projects does not pay due attention to inter-industry and interdisciplinary interaction, the achievement of sustainable demand for breakthrough technologies, products, and services, and development of a large-scale system for generation of scientific and technical knowledge. The authors have proved the need to coordinate the performance of national projects in the field of labor productivity, employment of the population, and science using network principles. It has been proposed to engage a coordination committee as the governing and coordinating bodies in the performance of these projects. The paper has established its functions and priority areas to improve the institutional provision of national projects. The authors proposed a mechanism of megaprojects as forms of executing national projects on the back of development institutions within a unified management and coordination system. Besides, the criteria for development institutions have been developed, a list of development institutions has been suggested and the structure of the platform for the generation of scientific knowledge and their transformation into innovations have been discussed. Uniqueness/value: The findings can be useful in executing national projects.

AB  - Sustainable development of land use is determined by changes of the regional supply of Land Use Functions (LUFs) and the demand of future societal land use claims. LUFs are based on the ecosystem services concept, but more adapted to human land use. In this paper, we assessed two peatland-use scenarios towards sustainable development in Northeast Germany in order to understand their impacts on LUFs and land use claims. For this, we extended an analytical framework designed to confront LUFs with land use claims identified in multi-level stakeholder strategies in a participatory manner. The sustainability assessment was performed with peatland-use scenarios "Services for services" and "Market determines usage" that favoured environmental and economic land use claims, respectively. Findings revealed possible trade-offs between land use claims for biomass production and regional value creation as well as for peatlands" carbon and nutrient sink, and habitat functions. The core achievement is an extended sustainability assessment framework integrating land use demands of multi-level stakeholder strategies into participatory impact assessment, in a way that land use claims serve as benchmarks for LUFs. This facilitates the understanding of sustainable land use in both supply and demand perspective, and the normative evaluation of ecosystem services.

AB  - One of the main roles of indicators is communication with stakeholders. However, different types of stakeholders can interpret indicators differently, due to different values, interests or cultural and academic context. Significant gaps between indicator data and stakeholders' perceptions can point to a failure of indicators in fulfilling their communication role. Despite this, most of the literature on stakeholder participation associated with sustainability indicators focuses on participation in the design and development of indicator systems (e.g. in indicator selection) or in data collection for indicator calculation. The main aim of this research is to explore the self-assessment of sustainability indicators conducted by different types of stakeholders, including local communities, practitioners, decision-makers and academia and how it relates with indicator data. A regional sustainable development indicator system for the Algarve region - the most southerly region of Portugal - is used. The analysis focuses on the subset of headline indicators, which usually aim at communicating with a wider audience. Results show several disagreements among the different participants, in some cases each group makes different interpretations of indicators. Different response patterns were identified between local stakeholders from different municipalities within the region. It was also possible to identify which indicators require improvements and what kind of improvements are needed, namely to enhance the communication ability of indicators. Our findings support the notion that an evaluation of sustainability performance by stakeholders can be used as an indirect way of evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of technical indicator sets and drawing conclusions about its overall utility and societal value.

AB  - Sustainable procurement depends on the definition of evaluation criteria when structuring selection processes for the most sustainable suppliers and products. Since a product or service may be associated with several sus-tainability impact categories throughout its life cycle, the procurement process may consider them as evaluation criteria. A recommended approach for such product evaluation is Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment (LCSA). The main objective of this study is to identify and catalogue general sustainability impact categories to be used as evaluation criteria in sustainable procurement. This research applied cognitive mapping, a tool in Problem Structuring Methods, based on a systematic literature review and interviews with 10 experts in the field. They also collaborated in the categorization and validation of the results. This study suggests a set of 58 midpoint and 14 endpoint sustainability categories, providing a contribution for different actors in society and supply chains, allowing them to evaluate supply options in sustainable procurement. The participation of experts enriched the understanding of the problem, allowing to observe a fourth sustainability dimension for procurement, comprising Supplier Governance and Compliance.

AB  - Countries share responsibility for the management and conservation of migratory bird species. However, a limited understanding of population dynamics hampers the implementation of harvest and transboundary management. Age-ratios and population density can be useful indicators to assess population dynamics to improve management and conservation actions. Here, the dynamics of an Atlantic population of Common quail Coturnix coturnix, using 32,508 quail samples and 4814 hunter questionnaires over a 20-year period (1996-2016) served as a comparative study for examining age-ratio patterns related to different geographic zones, population density and weather parameters. Results show that age-ratios varied over zones and years, specifically age-ratio 1 (ARI), used as an index of late breeding attempts, varied from 0.1 to 0.21. Age-ratio 2 (AR2), a surrogate of central recruitment, varied from 0.16 to 0.66. Finally, age-ratio 3 (AR3), used as an indicator of the population's annual breeding success, varied from 3.69 to 6.68. Age-ratio is linked to internal and external factors (i.e. effect of rainfall, variations over time and density-dependent relationships) depicting how quail age groups make segregated migration in time and space. Quail age groups perform a complex pattern of migration because of entwined changes in abundance, migration routes and timing, influencing population connectivity and dynamics. Our findings highlight the relevance of citizen science and transboundary agreements to improve management and conservation measures of migrant species. Administrations and policy-makers in developed and developing countries must coordinate efforts to engage hunters in a participatory management systems to achieve sustainability.

AB  - Since the mid-2000s, there has been increasing recognition of the promise of collaborative research and management for addressing complex issues in sustainably managing fresh water. A large variety of collaborative freshwater research and management processes is now evident around the world. However, how collective knowledge development, coproduction, or cocreation is carried out in an ethical manner is less well known. From the literature and our experiences as applied, transdisciplinary researchers and natural resource management practitioners, we seek to describe and explore these aspects of empirical cases of collaborative freshwater research and management. Drawing on cases from Indigenous community-based natural resource management in northern Australia, flood and drought risk management in Bulgaria, water management and climate change adaptation in the Pacific, and regional catchment and estuary management in Victoria and New South Wales in Australia, we identify lessons to support improved collaborative sustainable freshwater management research and practice. Cocreation represents an emerging approach to participation and collaboration in freshwater management research-practice and can be seen to constitute four interlinked and iterative phases: coinitiation, codesign, coimplementation, and coevaluation. For freshwater researchers and managers and their collaborators, paying attention to these phases and the ethical dilemmas that arise within each phase will support the cocreation of more effective and ethical research-practice through: sensitizing collaborators to the need for reflexivity in research-practice, proposing action research codesign as a method for managing emergent questions and outcomes, and supporting more equitable outcomes for collaborators through an emphasis on coevaluation and collaborative articulation of the links between research outputs and practice outcomes.

AB  - Different thinking and strategies are needed to transform our food systems at different scales. Food systems can be changed towards a more sustainable path through multi-stakeholder transformative governance at the landscape level because that is where national-level visions, objectives, and policies meet with local practice, priorities, and actions. Concrete and practical guidance on how to effectively put a multi-stakeholder transformative governance process into practice is missing. Through the Global Environment Facility (GEF) funded 'Food Systems, Land Use and Restoration Impact Programme', led by the World Bank, countries are supported in integrated landscape management (ILM) to ensure that production systems are embedded within wider landscapes to safeguard the natural capital and ecosystem services on which they depend. A customised methodology to assess and measure the effectiveness of ILM-relevant multi-stakeholder transformative governance, incorporating rights-based planning and tenure aspects, has been developed that makes governance explicit in the ILM process. This methodology aims to improve landscape-level institutional coordination, coherence, and collaboration through enhanced horizontal and vertical coordination and network dynamics. The conceptual framework of the customised methodology and how to operationalise it are explained and illustrated with the application in the country projects in Kenya, Nigeria, and Viet Nam. Making transformative governance explicit within the ILM process at the landscape level will require investments in time and capabilities, but allows governance to act as a catalyst towards more sustainable pathways.

AB  - This article draws lessons from a seven-year project on conservation and use of remaining coffee forests in the highlands of South-west Ethiopia. The project investigated the genetic diversity of Coffea arabica in its place of origin as well as economic perspectives of quality coffee marketing. With initially broad multidisciplinary natural and social sciences research a basis was laid for a second phase of praxis and implementation-oriented research in the same region.
   As a key innovative approach an NGO was established to take over all project management and implementation-oriented work in Ethiopia at the beginning of the second phase. This initiative helped decisively to solve the kind of problems identified in RESCUE (2012): ownership of results developed within R&D, the often missing mandate for science to actively contribute to solutions 'on the ground', and problems of cultural and social unsuitability and misunderstanding, which often are at the core of the problem when solutions from scientists are expected.
   The NGO operated as an intermediary between the involved scientists and other stakeholders from the coffee industry as well as from public administration and the Ethiopian polity. Its overall target was to contribute toward establishment of a biosphere reserve following the UNESCO MAB scheme and to use this scheme for the conservation and use of the remaining Ethiopian coffee forests. This target was achieved: the biosphere reserve has been accepted and accredited by UNESCO and is in operation. In addition, quality coffee from the development zones of the biosphere reserve is being sold on local markets in Yayu, SW Ethiopia.
   There are important lessons for the future of transdisciplinary and transformative sustainability science that can be drawn from this experience. These lessons concern concrete challenges and chances of research and development geared toward sustainable development:
   Working with implementation-targets as project organizing elements,
   communication and transfer of responsibility to involved stakeholders,
   challenges for praxis-oriented syntheses from research results,
   practical challenges of management and coordination for transdisciplinary projects, as well as.
   chances for long-term sustainability and use of research and implementation work.
   These lessons are described in this article with the overall intention to draw conclusions and to make them more widely available for scientists and project coordinators working in transdisciplinary projects that aim to contribute toward (more) sustainable development.

AB  - This paper uses a reflective method to gather findings with relation to a collaborative governance approach for the sociotechnical transition to a low carbon society in a regional context. As top-down and bottom-up approaches to sustainable transitions have proven insufficient in bringing about the necessary changes required to meet the demands of climate action, more collaborative approaches between local communities, national public bodies and research organisations are warranted. Within this, there is a need to understand the dynamics of collaborative governance for participants in the process. Through a process of reflective practice, this paper outlines the networks, personal capacities, organisational capacities, benefits and challenges of collaborative governance partnerships for sustainable transitions from the perspective of individuals within a collaborative committee working on a regional transition project on the Dingle Peninsula, Co Kerry, Ireland. Alongside this, some solutions to challenges outlined through reflection are highlighted. This research paper highlights the need for the incorporation of reflective practice within collaborative governance for the socio-technical transition to a low-carbon society.

AB  - Integrating the human dimension in Marine Spatial Planning (MSP) has been a primary challenge for MSP practices worldwide. One of the main issues in MSP is meaningful participation. However, there is an empirical gap regarding how participation functions and its relationship to achieving social sustainability goals. This paper aims to answer this question by studying MSP in Karimunjawa National Park, Indonesia. A qualitative descriptive research approach was used for the data collection and analysis. The results highlight that participation in Karimunjawa provides captivating alternatives in terms of participation, specifically in the areas of planning and management. We conclude that participation in management can mitigate the negative effects resulting from the lack of participation in planning, which may be constrained by factors such as knowledge and power gaps, as well as time limitations. The case-study findings also indicate that community responsibility towards the environment is closely related to their authority in regulating the utilisation of resources.Abstract in Bahasa Indonesia: rb.gy/edsvb7

AB  - This study presents a comparative assessment of emerging sustainability trends in tourist facilities, focusing on multiple hotels and resorts. By analyzing various aspects, such as energy efficiency, waste management, water conservation, and community engagement, this study evaluates the sustainability initiatives undertaken by these establishments. Through a systematic review of sustainability reports, practices, challenges, and innovations, it identifies key trends shaping the future of sustainable tourism in the hospitality industry. Initially, two case studies of hospitality developments that are awarded with sustainability prizes have been reviewed. These real estate developments are located in the Maldives and Greece, and following their detailed review, a comparison is drawn with a sample of multiple hotels in Pafos City, Cyprus. This study aims to ascertain the presence of a reciprocal relationship between sustainable tourism destinations and their immediate environs, encompassing the local community. This investigation hinges on an analysis of the sustainable practices implemented by hotels situated within these destinations. Moreover, this study explores the distance of hotels from achieving sustainable development by analyzing their environmental, social, and economic practices. This investigation encompasses a range of hotels in Cyprus and internationally. Recommendations toward a more sustainable approach for touristic real estate units has been made, and it is concluded that the development of sustainable tourist destinations requires active involvement from the local and the government authorities, supported by programs facilitating sustainable tourism. Encouraging synergies among businesses and supporting destination management partnerships are crucial. Sustainable hospitality should adhere to environmental excellence, social responsibility, and economic viability. The findings provide valuable insights for policymakers, hotel managers, and stakeholders seeking to enhance environmental performance and social responsibility within tourist accommodations.

AB  - The German Coal Commission brought together stakeholders from business, unions, environmental groups and the scientific field, local politicians and citizen representatives to reach a consensus on phasing out coal. It also allocated extensive resources to transform coal-producing regions. The results of the process raise two key questions: how was this consensus achieved, and why did it fail to end controversies around the coal phase-out? Through interviews with 14 of the 28 Commission members and an analysis of meeting minutes, we investigate the Commission's internal workings, the influence of state and federal governments, and the impact of stakeholders on the decisions made. Our analysis uses the framework of democratic legitimacy, focusing on throughput legitimacy and procedural justice. The Commission comprised a diverse range of members, and ultimately reached a consensus that met the government's mandate and agreed significant resources for affected regions, workers and companies. Public and regional actors had limited opportunities to participate in decision-making, however. No mechanisms were in place to counteract the power imbalance between the members, there was a significant gender imbalance, and climate ambitions were low. Overall, the degree of democratic legitimacy in the Commission was only moderate. A lack of inclusiveness, openness, transparency and accountability within the process, and its low discursive quality, created deficits that affected the entire resulting policy. To enhance democratic legitimacy and increase ecological ambitions in coal phase-outs, we recommend participatory, collaborative and reflexive decision-making processes. Mining countries should proceed carefully to ensure democratic legitimacy and beneficial outcomes for mining regions.

AB  - Within the context of Australian higher education, Open Educational Practice (OEP) requires a collective response from researchers and practitioners to instantiate novel, sustainable, scalable, and evidence-informed educational practices. This article outlines practice-led research's (PLR) role in educational research in open education and its potential to drive transformation and knowledge creation for practice in and through practice itself. As a creative arts methodology, PLR foregrounds practice as the locus of research activities. Practice-led researchers are deeply embedded in the research process, and knowledge production occurs through the generation of artefacts, processes, and techniques. With a focus on real-time making and research, PLR promotes a culture of knowledge production through the active 'doing' of practice within a process-oriented framework. In this paper, OEP is reframed as a creative project, and PLR, with its stress on researcher/practitioner reflexivity, becomes a methodology capable of fostering open educational practices in becoming.

AB  - Change management (CM) has been a persistent subject among organizations. The basic arguments originate from how and why organizations manage changes. However, CM is paramount for the success and survival of an organization in both highly competitive local and evolving global markets. The general perception of change usefulness or the aims of CM varies among stakeholders, namely employees, top management, as well as customers and governments. Against this backdrop, the current study explores the issue and identifies the motivators, enablers, and barriers of CM in the energy sector by focusing on different stakeholder categories: customers, employees, top management, and government. In addition, CM-related critical facilitating and barricading factors are explored with a structured method from all stakeholders' perspective. A total of 75 face-to-face interviews were carried out in four different big energy organizations where information was extracted and coded in commonality analysis. The findings concluded that all stakeholders hold a common perception that community welfare/lifestyle, environmental aspects, and country brand/image are the top motives, along with effective/transparent communication, willingness, and flexibility serving as enablers. Additionally, global stability, fear, and change complications are among the main challenges facing CM. With special consideration to each stakeholder, a wide-range commonality analysis demonstrates all stakeholders' perceptions of what drives, inhibits, and facilitates CM initiatives. It would be more beneficial for energy companies to balance all anticipations of stakeholders to perform successful and sustainable CM. This study is among the first in the region in the energy sector to adopt a broad stakeholder perspective for motivators, enablers, and barriers of CM towards green energy.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine how a cohort of university faculty leaders in Canadian universities conceptualize sustainable development, sustainable universities, the role universities play in achieving a sustainable future, key issues facing the university, and the barriers to implementing sustainability initiatives on campus.
   Design/methodology/approach - Research was collected through in-depth interviews with university faculty leaders from university members of the Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada. Interviews included both closed and open-ended questions and two checklists focused on sustainable development and sustainable universities. Interview transcripts are analyzed through the identification of respondent themes and using N'Vivo software.
   Findings - The majority of participants demonstrated they had previously given thought to their own understanding of sustainable development, but less had thought about the term sustainable university. The majority of participants would like to see their institutions incorporate sustainability in the avenues of education, research and daily operations. Participants agreed that the most obvious barriers to sustainability were financial and that leadership, incentive and demand are required to move forward with improving sustainability at universities.
   Originality/value - There are few studies that explore the conceptualizations of sustainability, what constitutes a "sustainable university" and what role universities should play in achieving sustainability held by major stakeholders, including faculty leaders. Higher education scholars share a reasonably common understanding of these concepts, but if universities are accountable for creating a sustainable future, all university stakeholders too must share a common understanding. This paper attempts to make a contribution to this significant gap in the literature.

AB  - To meet the United Nations (UN) sustainable development goals and the European Union (EU) strategy for a non-toxic environment, water resources and ecosystems management require cost-efficient solutions for prevailing complex contamination and multiple stressor exposures. For the protection of water resources under global change conditions, specific research needs for prediction, monitoring, assessment and abatement of multiple stressors emerge with respect to maintaining human needs, biodiversity, and ecosystem services. Collaborative European research seems an ideal instrument to mobilize the required transdisciplinary scientific support and tackle the large-scale dimension and develop options required for implementation of European policies. Calls for research on minimizing society's chemical footprints in the water-food-energy-security nexus are required. European research should be complemented with targeted national scientific funding to address specific transformation pathways and support the evaluation, demonstration and implementation of novel approaches on regional scales. The foreseeable pressure developments due to demographic, economic and climate changes require solution-oriented thinking, focusing on the assessment of sustainable abatement options and transformation pathways rather than on status evaluation. Stakeholder involvement is a key success factor in collaborative projects as it allows capturing added value, to address other levels of complexity, and find smarter solutions by synthesizing scientific evidence, integrating governance issues, and addressing transition pathways. This increases the chances of closing the value chain by implementing novel solutions. For the water quality topic, the interacting European collaborative projects SOLUTIONS, MARS and GLOBAQUA and the NORMAN network provide best practice examples for successful applied collaborative research including multi-stakeholder involvement. They provided innovative conceptual, modelling and instrumental options for future monitoring and management of chemical mixtures and multiple stressors in European water resources. Advancement of EU water framework directive-related policies has therefore become an option.

AB  - Successful sustainable land management efforts rely on stakeholder support and integration of stakeholder knowledge. This study explored the views of sustainable land management expressed by land use stakeholders and how these views contribute to land users' self-perceptions. We examined stakeholder perceptions in four case study areas in rural northern Germany. The target groups consisted of representatives from (i) agriculture; (ii) forestry; (iii) water management and (iv) rural planning and development ("cross-sector" representatives). The data were gathered using 60 semi-structured interviews and were analyzed qualitatively. The results indicate that differences in perceptions are greater between stakeholder groups than between regions; regional land management issues shape the framework of negotiations and the redefinition of concepts, whereas stakeholder group affiliations shape mindsets. The economic dimension of sustainability was emphasized, particularly by land managers; however, the social dimension was underrepresented in the statements. Furthermore, there are considerable differences between stakeholder groups in terms of the ways in which the spatial and temporal scales of sustainable land use are perceived. This study underscores the importance of examining stakeholder knowledge and understanding the complexity of land management and its benefits such that consensual management strategies may be developed.

AB  - Purpose
   While sustainability-oriented education is increasingly placing importance on engaging students in inter- and transdisciplinary learning processes with societal actors and authentic challenges in the centre, little research attends to how and what students learn in such educational initiatives. This paper aims to address this by opening the "black box" of learning in a Challenge Lab curriculum with transformational sustainability ambitions.
   Design/methodology/approach
   Realist evaluation was used as an analytical frame that takes social context into account to unpack learning mechanisms and associated learning outcomes. A socio-cultural perspective on learning was adopted, and ethnographic methods, including interviews and observations, were used.
   Findings
   Three context-mechanism-outcome (CMO) configurations were identified, capturing what students placed value and emphasis on when developing capabilities for leading sustainability transformations: engaging with complex "in-between" sustainability challenges in society with stakeholders across sectors and perspectives; navigating purposeful and transformative change via backcasting; and "whole-person" learning from the inside-out as an identity-shaping process, guided by personal values.
   Practical implications
   The findings of this paper can inform the design, development, evaluation and comparison of similar educational initiatives across institutions, while leaving room for contextual negotiation and adjustment.
   Originality/value
   This paper delineates and discusses important learning mechanisms and outcomes when students act as co-creators of knowledge in a sustainability-oriented educational initiative, working with authentic challenges together with societal actors.

AB  - Following COVID-19, new accreditation standards include digitization, entrepreneurship, social inclusion and the circular economy. Blockchain can help to simplify difficult accreditation processes that ensure worldwide teaching, learning, practice and business communication excellence. The paper proposes a Collaborative Learning and Student Work Evaluation (CLSWE) model based on blockchain technologies (BCTs) encompassing selected concepts from the scientific research peer-review process. BCTs are used to develop a safe platform for storing and exchanging data about students' projects and evaluations. The CLSWE model offers the possibility of improving cooperation between higher-education institutions and companies that seek the "employable skills" of proactive students. Before implementing the CLSWE model, a questionnaire was conducted to survey lecturers about their attitudes related to the potential application of BCTs. The results of the surveys are encouraging and reveal a desire and willingness to introduce BCTs in education. A project scheme with the main functionalities of the model and a description of the roles of the prominent participants was designed. A platform with a database created in the MySQL language for the testing model was built. This research also contributes to higher education literature in terms of the sustainability of the education process and collaborative learning with BCTs.

AB  - The community is the ultimate barometer of success or failure of an intervention. Involvement of community members in health care programmes, decision-making. evaluation and implementation is a major means for achieving the necessary fit between the programme and its beneficiaries. The World Bank-Funded Family Health Project was launched in Sindh Province of Pakistan, in 1992. It aims to strengthen the existing health system and improve the health status of the population. To achieve sustainable results, FHP focused on engaging community participation. Village Health Committers were formed at Basic Health Unit and Rural Health Centre levels under an Area Focus Approach. Village Health Committee members were trained to understand the basic concept of FHP. be able to identify factors which affect the health of the community, and suggest local methods for combating these problems, Thr Village Health Committer's main objective was to ensure community participation, improve utilisation of outreach health services, improve accountability of the service providers through community involvement, and decentralization of power at the community level. This article reflects on the experience of the FHP in implementing these objectives.

AB  - Children's participation is a universal right recognised by the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. This right corresponds to an image of children as social actors because of their relevant role in achieving inclusive, equitable, and sustainable development. Participation can take different forms and levels of involvement: consultative, collaborative, and child-led. This study aimed to explore types and results of child-led participatory practices. A scoping review was carried out to find out what evidence is available on child-led participatory experiences. Based on 674 identified papers, a total of 33 studies met the inclusion criterion. The qualitative analysis employed in this review allowed us to explore the depth and themes of these experiences. The results obtained showed that the experiences analysed differed in (a) the research design and data collection methods of the studies, (b) the age of the participating children, (c) countries in which the experiences took place, (d) specific topics, and (e) outcomes. Moreover, they all shared a non-adult-centric view of children's capacities for transformative action. The review has contributed to improving our understanding of children's transformative capacities based on the possibilities offered by adults when they adopt a child-rights approach and integrate co-participatory approaches, encouraging us to rethink childhood from other cultural codes inspired by equality, recognition, and agency.

AB  - The electrification of transportation in Germany has failed so far, but the disappointment has given way to more radical visions and new coalitions. Utilities, grid operators, and ICT companies have started to challenge the traditional image of the car. In their future scenarios, transportation, energy, and communication infrastructures must be aligned in order to achieve a sustainable society. This paper explores the co-production and enactment of this technological vision using the analytical framework of sociotechnical imaginaries. First, I describe how the idea of the electric vehicle as energy infrastructure was able to take hold within the German expert community. To understand how this approach might transform the existing mobility and energy practices, I examine two of the first R&D experiments that have enacted this vision in two radically different ways. Both reflect unarticulated assumptions about social life, including implicit cultural notions of self-determination, ownership, living arrangements, privacy, and control.

AB  - As global economic integration and rapid technological advancements transform international business, international engineering contracting has become essential for achieving sustainable development goals (SDGs). This paper investigates the significant impact of China's strategic initiatives, notably the "Going Global" strategy and the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), on the operational practices of Chinese enterprises involved in overseas investments. Central to this transformation is the Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) model, which emphasizes the integration of supply chain management and stakeholder collaboration to enhance performance in international EPC projects and underscores the crucial role of these elements in promoting sustainability. Incorporating insights from social network data analysis, this study reveals that contractors collaborating with various stakeholders-such as owners/consulting engineers, domestic and foreign customs departments, and group headquarters/design parties-exhibit a high degree of similarity in personnel profiles. This suggests that the internal organizational structure and personnel allocation of contractors could be optimized to enhance operational efficiency, aligning with the collaborative patterns identified. This study addresses a critical research gap by exploring how effective supply chain management and collaborative stakeholder engagement within multinational EPC projects contribute to sustainable outcomes. Employing advanced social network analysis software, the research examines the complex interactions among stakeholders and their influence on procurement dynamics. Findings indicate that strong relational networks and strategic collaborations significantly enhance procurement efficiency and project success, underscoring the importance of supply chain integration. Ultimately, integrating supply chain management principles into the EPC model not only offers innovative perspectives for advancing sustainability in international projects but also provides actionable insights for improving project outcomes within the BRI framework. This research underscores the pivotal role of supply chain organization and stakeholder cooperation in achieving sustainability objectives, thereby enriching the discourse on sustainable enterprise operation and supply chain management in the context of global initiatives.

AB  - Purpose This paper aims to cognizance consumers' intention to participate in collaborative consumption (CC). Also, the gender difference regarding the above is examined. Design/methodology/approach To quantify the consumers' intention to participate in CC cross-sectional survey method has been used. In total, 333 potential consumers selected through convenience sampling participated in the survey. The study used the capabilities of the structured equation modelling technique to validate the proposed research model. Findings Except for hedonic motives, all other drivers such as reputation, economic benefits, sustainable motives and trust have a significant influence on the intention to participate in CC. The effect of gender was found on the relationship between Trust and Intentions only. Practical implications This study can be used as a guiding path in the domain of CC for practitioners, marketers, startups and policymakers as the opinion of potential users has been reported. The results of the study highlight that the consumers' interest in CC participation and social reputation are the most influential drivers of intention to participate in CC. Marketers should design their strategies in such a way that the individual should feel like a social hero rather than just a responsible consumer while participating in CC. Originality/value The present study contributes to the literature by examining the intention to participate in CC through the lens of self-determination theory (SDT), specifically in the Indian context. The authors have also extended the SDT by adding a trust factor that is best to their knowledge not integrated till now. The present study integrated cognitive, economic, psychological and relational aspects to understand CC behavior.

AB  - The 'Pathways' transformative knowledge network is an international group of research organisations, collaborating to explore processes of social transformation and to share insights across disciplines, cultures and contexts. Working across the domains of food, energy and water, the network is experimenting with new methods of research and engagement that both help to understand - and contribute to - transformations to sustainability. This article outlines some of the early experiences of two hubs in the network (UK and Argentina) and reflects on the lessons learned for 'engaged excellence'. It also describes how approaches to transdisciplinary research (building on a diversity of academic and non-academic traditions) vary across different contexts, and how wider lessons in this regard will be shared across the consortium into the future.

AB  - The World Health Organization (WHO) updates and enriches the accessible resources and measures, such as tools for well-being, the global index of happiness, and global quality of life. Seeing that health is a basic human right as well as a key indicator of quality of life, the School of Nursing in the Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) has developed the Service-Learning (SL) programme namely "Healthy lifestyle challenges in developing communities". Cambodia is the first service site, where access and resources on health care are limited and expensive. The teaching team believes that some of the risk factors leading to the top ten causes of death can be reduced through health promotion activities. Experiential learning and outcome assessments are the methods of teaching and learning in SL, putting emphasis on how students can learn to serve and serve to learn. The challenges of the SL programme are the sustainability of service and empowerment of local stakeholders for committing to developing their own SL programme in meeting the needs of Cambodians. Meanwhile, our vision is one of developing PolyU students in global citizenship and leadership through provision of scholarships with the necessary resources and support in real-world practice.

AB  - This article provides a critical overview of national and international efforts to shift education to what has been commonly called 21st century learning. Governments, non-profits, and corporate consortiums are in large part responsible for education reform designed to re-conceptualize K12 education for the 21st century. The article introduces an integrative transformative educational concept called the Living School that connects K12 educational reform with Education for Sustainability, sustainable community development, and individual well-being. Brief portraits describe schools that reflect Living School attributes. Ambitious initiatives to transform education for the 21st century require enlightened leadership and governance structures for scalable, system-wide reform. This paper offers an alternative vision for educational leadership and governance to support education reform based on a holistic approach to sustainable community economic development. An interdisciplinary model of professional learning to prepare education leaders for an alternative vision of education leadership is proposed.

AB  - In recent years, increasing numbers of luxury groups have adopted sustainable practices in their supply chains (sourcing, manufacturing, logistics, distribution, servicing, waste and recycling). However, the report from Greenpeace International organization (2014) indicates that some luxury brands/companies did not actively conduct sustainable practices to produce items, which is likely attributed to the cost and risks caused by such practices outweighing the benefits. This, to some extent, is due to the failure of developing collaborative practices. Specifically, some luxury brands may fail to develop collaborative practices to create value that are able to benefit multiple stakeholders. Thus, in our study, we explore the value creation mechanism to create sustainable value that benefits not only brands' shareholders, but also other stakeholders, including producers, customers, other stakeholders in the society (e.g., marginalized people) and the environment. In addition, based on a case study from Stella McCartney and Kering and the literature on value creation, we develop a novel model for guiding sustainable value creation (i.e., value co-creation model), where the conceptual building blocks and specific practices are presented. Our contribution lies in extending the knowledge of the value co-creation model from co-creation with customers to co-creation with multiple stakeholders and elaborating systematically and empirically sustainable value co-creation mechanisms including the building blocks and specific practices. In addition, this study offers significant managerial insights for luxury brands/companies to effectively achieve sustainable value.

AB  - About 3 billion people worldwide depend on fuelwood to meet their domestic energy needs. Almost 90% of the population in Sub-Saharan Africa use fuelwood-based forms of energy. However, its use is often unsustainable and is one driver of environmental degradation. In Tanzania, the majority of rural residents depend on fuelwood as their major source of cooking energy. The adaptation measures applied by small-scale farmers in response to fuelwood scarcity are typically unsustainable with regard to socio-economic, environmental, and food security dimensions. This study applies a methodological framework that assesses the personally experienced impact of coping strategies by local stakeholders on sustainability criteria. This framework comprises (1) the selection of appropriate adaptation measures; (2) the identification of local sustainability criteria; and (3) the participatory impact and frequency assessments at two case study sites in the semi-arid region of Dodoma in central Tanzania. Overall, eight coping strategies from 23 measures applied in the region were selected and four sustainability criteria defined by local key informants were identified. The participatory impact and frequency assessment show that the strategies of "on-farm tree planting" and "use of improved cooking stoves" are rated as positive across all four sustainability criteria and are regularly applied by the farmers. Two of the eight strategies are clearly negative: "eat fewer meals" and "increase in walking distance to collect fuelwood." These measures are regularly and widely used by farmers, thus amplifying the negative rating. Overall, the experiences of farmers suggest that applied coping strategies have the greatest negative effect on the environmental condition and, on average, a rather positive effect on economic conditions. The results offer an approach for developing a reliable monitoring of how adaptation measures are applied in response to fuelwood scarcity and to achieve distinct values for benchmarking.

AB  - The research purpose to examine collaborative governance, the potential and opportunities for the Nusantara New Capital City. The research design utilizes a qualitative exploratory method, where collected data is then analyzed using descriptive techniques. The results showed that the realization of collaborative governance in the development of Nusantara New Capital City has not been optimized due to less intensive and sustainable communication.; low levels of trust among local stakeholders; failure to build ownership and lack of transparency in achievements; lack of shared vision, mission, and perspective on resolving common issues; suboptimal realization of common values in the development of Nusantara New Capital City; achievement of only 38.1% completion progress in development; and the realization of strategic planning being less accelerated. The model for the collaborative governance optimization of Nusantara New Capital City is developed as a model emphasizing the empowerment of equality and proportional aspects of local stakeholders supported by accommodated regulation. The model can be applied to various collaborative governance objects and in other regions because it is developed according to the flexibility, conditionality, actuality, and factual nature of the issues.

AB  - Decades of research demonstrate that practitioners and scholars may have only a vague notion of what project success is and thus settle for conflicting or inaccurate attributions of this still-elusive phenomenon. Stakeholder evaluations may differ as multiple groups and coalitions seldom hold the same viewpoint. A project that meets business expectations may have unintended consequences on society, highlighting the importance of sustain -ability. Thus, it remains challenging to devise a parsimonious success model that key stakeholders, internal and external, can minimally agree upon. This paper updates, recalibrates and further "complexifies" project success based on four multidimensionality sources: benefits realization, stakeholder perceptions, issues of timing, and sustainability. The paper proposes a four-dimensional model of success to assess project plan success, business case success, and green efficacy, along with the shared feeling of key stakeholders. The paper concludes with an agenda highlighting future research to further our understanding of the project success phenomenon.

AB  - Society is in strong need to change the way in which energy is produced and consumed. To cope with this complex challenge, integration of knowledge from different disciplines is needed. This paper shows how an interdisciplinary educational approach called networked learning combined with sustainability transition theories can help groups of engineering students to address pressing societal challenges such as the energy transition. A series of 8 workshops was held with an interdisciplinary engineering student team of a University of Technology. Networked learning within the student team showed an ad-hoc character, mainly caused by shifting student constellations during workshops. Workshops focusing on short-term goals resulted in more concrete output. The team showed a high level of equality amongst members and actively reflected on organisational aspects of their learning process. Sustainability transitions concepts and theories that integrate multiple disciplinary perspectives further supported the learning process and helped to guide strategic decision making.

AB  - In recent years, clam mariculture output in China has steadily increased. However, environmental pollution and high aquaculture intensity have led to frequent diseases and unstable economic benefits. This study analyzes field research data from clam farming in Zhejiang Province, Tianjin City, and Shandong Province, focusing on farming costs, revenue, break-even points, and net profit sensitivity. The findings reveal that (1) variable costs consistently exceeded fixed costs, particularly in seedling costs, labor, and water rental; (2) net profit and margins ranked highest in Zhejiang, followed by Tianjin and Shandong; (3) Zhejiang exhibited the lowest break-even operation rate and the largest price discrepancies; (4) sensitivity to selling prices was high across all regions, with Zhejiang showing the lowest sensitivity to variable costs. To enhance economic benefits and promote sustainable development, government authorities and industry stakeholders should focus on cultivating high-quality seeds, implementing scientific management, developing green aquaculture, and emphasizing brand development.

AB  - Understanding the effectiveness of the implementation of higher education policies could help stakeholders make informed decisions. As a relatively new policy, research on the evaluation of the reformed national college enrollment policy-Strengthening Basic Disciplines Plan (SBDP), especially from the perspective of policy innovation and implementation is limited. This study attempts to evaluate SBDP at an early stage, thereby understanding how effectively SBDP has been implemented and what its innovations are. Utilizing the policy documentation and institutional admission documents, this study operated qualitative data using a semi-quantitative method, primarily focusing on two comparisons: the SBDP policy documentation vs. institutional SBDP admission documents, and institutional SBDP vs. Independent Enrollment Policy (IEP) admission documents. Results showed that most pilot institutions regulate SBDP admission documents in accordance with the policy documentation. However, institutional divergence in practical implementations still exists, even under centralized governance. In addition, four major demand-oriented innovations such as cultivating talents in basic disciplines and cultivation strategies in SBDP were found, compared to IEP. These findings have implications in helping Chinese higher education stakeholders to effectively implement SBDP and achieve sustainable talent cultivation for national strategies.

AB  - PurposeThe explanatory study aimed to understand the global perspective of quality education and describe transformative strategies that empower teacher educators and equip the education system and future teachers to act as change agents by fostering learning processes that support students towards a sustainable future.Design/methodology/approachThe explanatory study used a descriptive qualitative design. The researchers conducted four semi-structured group interviews of the 23 participants including pre- and in-service teachers, teacher educators, and policymakers from Austria, Germany, Italy, Canada, the United States, and South Africa during the Teach4Reach 1.0 project on SDG4. The inductive thematic analysis of the data was guided by Kuckartz's six-phase approach for constructing data-driven categories.FindingsThe study identified SDG4 as pivotal in supporting the overall UN Agenda 2030. Furthermore, three distinct themes unequivocally emerged and were developed concerning the imperative nature of envisioning transformation for sustainability: (1) collaboration, (2) well-being and context of individuals, and (3) strategies for skill development.Research limitations/implicationsDue to the qualitative nature of the study, the participants' comprehensive understanding of the SDGs and their perceptions remained conditional to methodological subjectivity.Practical implicationsThe study enabled a dialogue between educational stakeholders (pre- and in-service teachers, teacher educators, and policymakers), whereby an awareness and encouragement of SDG4 regarding quality education and training of quality future teachers occurred. A further implication includes increased collaboration and dialogue regarding the well-being of individuals (educational stakeholders), the context of individuals, and strategies for skill development.Originality/valueThe study elaborates on reaching the SDGs and identifies themes essential for sustainability transformation in teacher education. It also highlights further research and clarity about the responsibilities of educational stakeholders for quality education, for instance, (1) how to increase the supply of quality teachers by focusing on collaboration, well-being, and the contexts of individuals and (2) how value-embedded skills can support quality education for sustainability.

AB  - Purpose - Firms are increasingly accountable for their suppliers' social and environmental practices. Nonmarket stakeholders nowadays do not hesitate to confront buying firms for their suppliers' misconducts by mobilizing demonstrations, social media campaigns and boycotts. This paper aims to develop a typology of response strategies by targeted firms when they face such contentions and to empirically investigate why these strategies vary among those firms.
   Design/methodology/approach - Drawing on social movement and stakeholder salience theories, the authors develop a set of hypotheses linking their typology of four response strategies to three key contextual factors - nonmarket stakeholder salience, nonmarket stakeholder ideology and the target firm reputation - and examine them using a vignette-based experiment methodology.
   Findings - The results suggest that nonmarket stakeholder salience significantly impacts the nature of response (reject or concede), whereas the nonmarket stakeholder ideology is significantly related to the intensity of response (trivial or vigorous). Interestingly, the firms' reputation was found to have no significant effect on their response strategy when they faced stakeholder contentions.
   Originality/value - This paper adds both theoretical and methodological value to the existing literature. Theoretically, the study develops and tests a comprehensive typology of response strategies to nonmarket stakeholder contentions. Methodologically, this study is original in leveraging a vignette-based experiment that allows establishing causal factors of response strategies following a supplier sustainability misconduct.

AB  - Selection of optimal technologies for novel biobased products and processes is a major challenge in process design, especially when are considered many alternatives available to transform materials into valuable products. Furthermore, such technological alternatives vary in their technical performances and cause different levels of economic and environmental impacts throughout their life cycles. Additionally, selection of optimal production pathways requires a shift from the traditional materials management practices to more sustainable practices. This contribution provides a method for optimizing multi-product network systems from a sustainability perspective by applying the GREENSCOPE framework as a sustainable objective function. A case study is presented in which the four GREENSCOPE target areas (i.e., efficiency, energy, economics, and environment) are evaluated by 21 preselected indicators as part of a multi-objective optimization problem of a biojet fuel production network. The biojet fuel production network evaluated in this study consists of four main elements: (1) feedstocks management, (2) conversion technologies, (3) co-products upgrading, and (4) auxiliary sections for in situ production of raw materials and utilities. For the sustainability objective function, the 21 indicators are analyzed considering multiple perspectives of stakeholders to study their influence on the decision-making process. It is, different sets of weighting factors are assigned to each of the four target areas. Hence, this sustainability evaluation from different stakeholders' perspectives allows identifying optimal networks, specific target areas with great potential for improvements, and processing steps with great influence in the entire network performance. As a result, diverse optimal network arrangements were obtained according to the multiple stakeholders' perspectives. This evidences that a win-win situation for all sustainability aspects considered can hardly be reached. Finally, this contribution demonstrated the applicability of the proposed methodology for sustainability evaluation, optimization, and decision-making in the context of a multi-product material facility by developing a multi-objective optimization model.

AB  - Mintzberg's version of emergent strategy is based on the idea that strategies are contingent on circumstances that change from time to time often very rapidly and therefore papers focused on strategy and detailed planning are limited in their practical application. The word strategy as far as Mintzberg is concerned is anathema, therefore, introducing a concept that has a misconception embedded in it. This paper claims that education for sustainable development and higher education institutions' survival depends on adopting postmodern thinking, in other words, digital transformation. This conceptual paper proposes a blueprint of a process for developing a series of agile potentially short-term conceptual solutions thereby embracing the expectation that the rate of change in societies is accelerating. This paper scrutinizes (a) the applicability of emergent strategy/strategic approach to higher education institutions, (b) how postmodernism influences higher education institutions to become digital hubs of commoditization of knowledge and (c) how the integrated capabilities of digital transformation build sustainability in education delivery. Structural Equation Methodology is proposed to examine the impact of postmodernism on the sustainable delivery of education in higher education institutions, and the need to foster relevant emergent strategies is also justified. The paper also develops new research propositions and managerial implications for driving optimistic digital education. Ultimately, it offers a framework for spear-leading effective and leading post-modernistic digital transformation. Emerging education technology, sustainable digital transformation and advanced use of robotic-human cognitive collaboration are experiencing a significant transformation. Universities play a vital role in enhancing engagement within higher education. One of the managerial implications of the results and discussion is the need for higher education institutions to provide taught leadership and planning in emergent strategy formulation and implementation. The findings confirm the significant importance of linking the Structural Equation Method and the postmodern strategic context in which we argue that higher education institutions require emerging rethinking.

AB  - The Persian Gulf Iranian fishery, just like many marine fisheries, needs sustainable management. The assessment of the sustainability of the fishery requires the development of a set of local indicators. This paper used an integrated multi-criteria participatory framework as a decision-making approach, to evaluate sustainability relating to ecological, economic, social, technological, and management dimensions. The indicators were modified from appropriate tools such as Rapfish and other reference studies. The determination of the importance of sustainability indicators was performed based on local stakeholders' opinions in the Persian Gulf, Iran. Three groups of stakeholders in this field have included fishers, managers, and researchers. Also, cognitive mapping as a soft methodology was applied to useful tools, for the assessment of the perceived linkage among indicators. The result of the assessment was analyzed and provided an overview for understanding the decision-making process and how to achieve sustainable fishery management in Iran.

AB  - This qualitative research examines how sustainable educational transformation emerges through teachers' participation in enduring professional learning communities, with a specific focus on inclusive education practices. By investigating the intersection of educational sustainability and professional development, this study analyzed ten teacher communities comprising 156 educators who met regularly throughout the school year. The research revealed how sustainable professional networks create lasting institutional change through four critical stages of teacher transformation: initial resistance to inclusion, recognition of pedagogical misconceptions, development of non-judgmental professional discourse, and establishment of sustainable, inclusive practices. The communities functioned as a sustainable infrastructure that fostered both the environmental and social dimensions of educational development, enabling teachers to build lasting professional confidence and emotional resilience through integrated theoretical learning and practical application. This sustainable approach to professional development helped educators overcome initial resistance to individualized solutions and empowered them to adopt more responsive, inclusive classroom strategies. By creating supportive knowledge-sharing networks that extend beyond initial implementation, these professional communities demonstrated their capacity to generate lasting educational change. The findings illuminate how systematic, collaborative professional development can create sustainable educational frameworks that enhance both teacher growth and inclusive pedagogical approaches, contributing to the broader goals of sustainable educational development. This research offers insights into building sustainable professional learning environments that support long-term institutional change while advancing inclusive education practices.

AB  - The design and implementation of REDD+ projects requires understanding the local ecological, economic and social context. This paper analyzes how REDD+ influences the context of ecosystem management, from both a conceptual and an ecosystem-scale perspective. We analyze how REDD+ changes the economic interests in ecosystem management for different stakeholders, and present a case study demonstrating the economic benefits of sustainable forest use versus oil palm plantation in Indonesia. We also analyze the economic costs of carbon emissions from land use conversion, and show that in Kalimantan, Indonesia, net revenues from REDD+ need to be US$ 3/ton CO2 to allow sustainable forest use to compete with oil palm on peat, and US$ 7/ton CO2 for mineral soil. Subsequently we present four insights from our ecosystem analysis relevant for REDD+.

AB  - This study contributes to the Sustainable Development Goal 15 by examining the dynamics of balancing the ecological footprint and meeting fundamental human needs in terms of food and shelter. The analysis utilizes a panel dataset comprising 9 countries with ecological deficits, covering the period from 1971 to 2022. The estimators employed in the study are robust to cross-sectional dependence and allow for heterogeneous slope coefficients. The findings, based on the FE-DK and MMQR models, provide empirical evidence supporting the ecological deficit hypothesis. The validity of the ecological deficit hypothesis is verified by the inverted U-shaped nexus between economic growth and ecological deficits. Finance plays a mitigating role in reducing the ecological deficit for food, but it is associated with higher levels of deficit for shelter, particularly at the upper quantile. Trade openness exacerbates the ecological deficit for food, but it helps reduce the deficit for shelter. Robustness analysis, conducted using the half-panel jackknife multivariate Wald-type test, confirms that the covariates exhibit Granger-causal relationships with the ecological deficit. Bidirectional causal relationships are observed between the ecological deficit for food and squared economic growth. Additionally, bidirectional relationships exist between trade and urban population and the ecological footprint for shelter. The findings offer useful insights for policymakers and stakeholders that are working towards achieving sustainable development.

AB  - Climate change related risks are likely to be addressed, where not already, by new governmental regulations, such as the EU Emission Trading System, carbon taxes, new building codes and energy efficiency standards. However, a gap exists between contemporary research into and knowledge of sustainability embedded carbon accounting and application of these techniques by practitioners. This research addresses the gap between 'knowledge generation' of sustainability embedded carbon accounting instruments (research) and sustainability embedded carbon accounting 'knowledge application' through use of tools (practice) by examining their relationship, the characteristics of the gap, investigating who can change the current relationship, what changes are feasible in the near and medium terms, and how these changes can best be introduced to forge ahead with cleaner production. Accountants in academe as 'knowledge generators' have been vociferous in their calls for accountants in practice to use their professional strengths as appliers of instruments to manage the impacts of business on the environment and the environment on cleaner production by business. For many, carbon is the face of sustainability and the accounting for carbon a method of participating in the sustainability agenda, yet prior research indicates that accountants in practice have been slow to engage with climate change and carbon issues being forced upon them by the environmental crisis. Empirical evidence from a survey of professional accounting firms in South Australia finds that many accounting tools related to sustainability developed by academics are ignored and need greater promotion, yet the results also suggest that, unexpectedly, practitioners apply some 'knowledge' tools promoted by researchers confirming that a gap between academics and practitioners exists. The paper concludes that increased collaboration between academic accounting and professional practice will be the only way for evolution of the relationship between research and practice of sustainability embedded carbon accounting in order to forge ahead towards cleaner production.

AB  - The supply chain of every company is essential to its overall operation. Global disruption has an unanticipated and immediate impact on supply chains across all industrial sectors. The supply chain must, therefore, demonstrate resilience in order to resist such upheaval because it is dy-namic and extremely vulnerable to global uncertainties. Moreover, it must not only return to its initial form but also prove able to achieve steady, sustainable performance. To do so, supply chain activities necessitate value co-creation between stakeholders. One means of achieving this objective is through the application of service-dominant logic (SDL) whose eleven core premises define the behaviour, governance, and consequences of service-based exchange. The novelty of the research reported here lies in the mapping and review frameworks of current supply chain resilience towards sustainability (SCRTS) from an SDL perspective. This study represents the first to combine an SDL perspective and SCRTS since no formula has yet been devised to address this combination of factors. This study proposes the application of a conceptual framework of SCRTS from an SDL perspective by involving selected premises, resource integration, institutional structures, and collaboration. Type of Paper: Conceptual Framework.

AB  - Introduction: The aim of this short communication is to examine the journey of scholarship in health professions education (HPE). Methods: We will focus on tangible small steps to start, sustain, and succeed along this journey. Through a proposed innovation in scholarship - micro-scholarship - we will describe how this is similar to and an extension of bite-size or micro-learning, and workplace micro-practice related to just-in-time (JiT) learning settings. Results: We will demonstrate how the small steps for generating and engaging with micro-content can be similarly applied to micro-scholarship. Then, progressive and iterative refinement of output and practice of micro-scholarship can be combined and result in macro-scholarship after cycles of public engagement for final digital or print publication. This stepwise approach creates an accessible, sustainable strategy to achieve success as a scholar in HPE. We will elaborate on micro, macro, and meta matters and celebrate how these small steps encourage and allow broad participation in the creation, critique, and progressive refinement of scholarship. Conclusion: Small, sustainable, steps leads to success as a scholar in Health Professions Education Micro (macro and meta) matters.

AB  - 1. Transdisciplinary sustainability scientists are called to conduct research with community actors to understand and improve relations between people and nature. Yet, research hierarchies and power relations continue to favour western academic researchers who remain the gatekeepers of knowledge production and validation.2. To counter this imbalance, in 2018 we structured a multi-day workshop to co-design a set of principles to guide our own transdisciplinary, international and intercultural community of practice for biocultural diversity and sustainability. This community includes community collaborators, partner organizations, and early career and established researchers from Argentina, Bolivia, Canada, Germany, Mexico and South Africa. In 2021, we undertook online critical reflection workshops to share our research experiences and deepen our intercultural understanding of the application of the principles.3. Through these exercises, we adopted seven principles for working together that include: honour self-determination and nationhood; commit to reciprocal relationships; co-create the research agenda; approach research in a good way: embed relational accountability; generate meaningful benefits for communities; build in equity, diversity and inclusion; and emphasize critical reflection and shared learning. We explain these principles and briefly highlight their application to our research practices.4. By sharing these principles and associated practices, we seek to facilitate debate and spur transformations in how we conduct international and intercultural sustainability research. Our efforts also illustrate a strategy for on-going knowledge co-production as we cultivate safe and ethical spaces for learning together. Lessons learned may be particularly useful to those who engage in intercultural, collaborative research to advance sustainability transformations.

AB  - Between 2008 and 2010, Lund University took part in three international benchmarking projects, E-xcellence+, the eLearning Benchmarking Exercise 2009, and the First Dual-Mode Distance Learning Benchmarking Club. A comparison of these models revealed a rather high level of correspondence. From this finding and from desktop studies of the current discourse regarding e-learning, a conceptual framework for e-learning has emerged based on a range of critical success factors. This model could be used as a foundation for future e-learning and as an inspiration to develop, implement, evaluate, and internalize e-learning. It shows that various aspects of accessibility, flexibility, interactiveness, personalization, and productivity should be embedded in all levels of management and services within the field of e-learning in higher education. To meet students' expectations, demands, and rights, these critical issues should be taken into account from a holistic perspective with transparency and innovation in mind. Therefore, successful e-learning requires change from an organizational as well as a pedagogical perspective. One conclusion from this study is that a revolution is on the way and that learning will be reoriented along paradigms of collaboration and networking. Globalization, sustainability, and lifelong learning will be some of the leading concepts in this process.

AB  - This study applies the mental model and cognitive mapping method to involve stakeholders in delineating the mutual relations between sources of water, energy, and food (WEF) production in the Varamin Plain (VP). Through involving farmers and managerial experts, the approach facilitates the deployment of community communication patterns to recognize and comprehend problems and move from single-loop learning to double-loop learning. The dynamic model was driven from the final mental model of the participants to reflect changes in the systems over time. The system dynamic (SD) model incorporates three scenarios for enhancing irrigation efficiency, managing groundwater extraction, and satisfying environmental needs. The results uncovered that the surface and underground water resources of the VP will gradually decrease within the next two decades in the range of 158 and 2700 million cubic meters (MCM) per year. Also, the plain suffers from water insecurity and a 162 MCM shortage. Consequently, focusing on understanding the nexus and nexus governance can enhance resource management and achieve sustainable development goals. Essentially, promoting collaborative governance, such as creating cooperative organizations and implementing double-loop learning, and instituting a water market, regulatory governance, and monitoring laws can improve the state of Varamin Plain's resources. These results carry important policy implications for using mental models to consider dynamics for discussions on participatory management of the WEF system nexus and environmental management.

AB  - The ocean is a unique system connecting ecological, economic, social, and cultural components, through which goods and services regulate the planetary condition and support the development of mankind. However, its increasing use has followed the exponential growth of the global economic system, outpacing humanity's ability to develop the knowledge necessary to establish a basis for its proper use. Hence, there is an added perception that our necessary knowledge about the functioning of the ocean for its appropriate planning and management, advances at a slow pace, with which the ocean would be losing quality and sustainability. Systemic views of the ocean tend to highlight dominant components and processes instead of structural details, establishing a quality shortcut to the knowledge where society can understand current and future ocean conditions. To achieve the desired ocean health and sustainability, we propose the formation of a base of knowledge of the marine and coastal environments, capable of supporting best practices and policies for planning and management. We drew from the interdisciplinary research developed by the Brazilian research group "Ecosystem-Based Marine and Coastal Management (Eco-MCM), "which has been developing projects based on three fundamental steps: (1) systemic analysis of the marine and coastal environments, highlighting their ecosystems, ecosystem services, social and economic benefits produced by the services and the stakeholders benefited; (2) modeling of the studied systems, and (3) propositional phase to incorporate models to support the practices and policies for their planning, management, and governance. As such, they are aligned with the United Nations Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development (2021-2030) challenges and outcomes.

AB  - Since 2014, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) has played a leading role in facilitating agroecology discussions and dialogues among many different regions and stakeholders. FAO's engagement with agroecology as one promising way of achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) was confirmed in 2018 with the launch of the Scaling Up Agroecology Initiative. FAO's function is of a dual but interconnected nature: that of normative operational work. This is reflected in FAO's work on agroecology, which combines the normative and operational aspects to create synergies through their linkages, thus creating a policy bridge for transformation. Undergirding this work is the framework of the 10 Elements of Agroecology, which was approved by FAO Governing Bodies in November 2019 and has been expanded to include its use in visual narratives to describe plausible theories of change to facilitate food systems transformation. The 10 Elements serve as the foundation for the normative and operational aspects of the Scaling Up Agroecology Initiative (SUAI), which include various tools, knowledge pieces, projects, policy initiatives, and sharing platforms. Nowhere is this foundation of the 10 Elements clearer than in the Tool for Agroecology Performance Evaluation (TAPE), a tool for assessing the multidimensional performance of agroecology. TAPE relies upon the 10 Elements to characterize the level of agroecological transition of production systems in agriculture at scale and in time. Upon this snapshot of transition, criteria of quantitative performance are assessed. Recent utilization of TAPE across the globe has strongly shown how TAPE can help actors make data -driven decisions to elicit transformational change at all levels of the territory, when it is linked to the other aspects of the SUAI underpinned by the 10 Elements, thus effectively bridging policy and praxis.

AB  - Conservation planning models need to be more inclusive, considering both social and ecological dimensions in order to achieve sustainable conservation. To do this, stakeholders need to understand the communities that border protected areas, which involves insight into attitudes. This research therefore aimed to determine what influences the attitudes of local communities towards protected areas, culminating in a model. The research was conducted at three case study sites across South Africa, each involving a nature reserve and a proximate local community. Multiple qualitative methods were used to gather data from the local community and protected area staff around different aspects that influence attitudes. Following cross-case analysis, meta-themes were identified that formed the building blocks of the model and informed the accompanying practical recommendations regarding implementation thereof. The model outlines the centrality of relationships between local communities and park stakeholders, which are impacted by benefits, costs, facilitators and detractors. It also outlines how positive attitudes can be fostered through practical actions. As communities receive and perceive the benefits of living alongside wildlife, there is potential for positivity to improve while simultaneously achieving biodiversity conservation that is supported by the community. In line with adaptive management, users can test and adapt the model, continually aiming for conservation planning that is more community-based.

AB  - To achieve provincial collaborative management of absolute sustainability, carbon footprint needs to be applied within carbon planetary boundaries. We constructed the provincial-level production-based carbon exceedance and consumption-based carbon exceedance footprint via an environmentally extended multiregional input-output model and downscaled carbon planetary boundaries. We quantified the extent to which consumption -based provinces' demands lead to the carbon exceedance of each province in China. The results are as following: (1) In 2017, the total carbon exceedance was 4211.98 Mt. 53.86% of the total carbon exceedance is embodied in interprovincial trade flows, which are mainly transferred from the northern and northeastern regions of China to China's eastern coastal regions. (2) More than half of the total carbon exceedance embodied in exports is supplied by coal mineral-rich provinces, such as Inner Mongolia, Hebei, Shanxi, Shandong, Liaoning, Henan and Xinjiang. (3) A total of 23.42%, 15.87% and 9.29% of the carbon exceedance embodied in net imports are used to meet final demand for Guangdong, Zhejiang and Beijing, respectively. The obtained results are helpful for the redistribution of carbon planetary boundary transgression responsibilities among provinces and the formulation of absolute sustainable carbon management policies.(c) 2022 Institution of Chemical Engineers.

AB  - Globalization can have substantial impact on local commons by reducing sustainability of ecosystems and their vital services. Without effective local institutions, these resources are at high risk of exploitation, especially to feed global markets. This study proposes a multiscale ecosystem framework (MEF) that incorporates information on ecosystem components, socioeconomic processes, and their interactions. This includes inter and intra common interactions and multi-scale processes to evaluate inter and intra scale changes in socioeconomic and ecological processes of commons. Local participation and multi-disciplinary information are critical in achieving sustainability. Using a global dataset of selected indicators, a general decline is observable in local commons that face globalization. The need for increasing resilience of commons through multi-scale adaptation strategies can inform decisions at the national, state and local levels. Increased resilience through ecosystem-based approach can minimize impacts of globalization using information on multiattribute processes, equity considerations, development of robust institutions, and effective strategies for adaptation.

AB  - Servant leadership is a style that is considered to be ethical, positive, and desirable due to its compatibility with an array of situations. Moreover, work engagement is a key factor that can have positive short- and long-term outcomes for organizations. This research focuses on the role of servant leaders and their effects on employees' work engagement in an academic setting. Furthermore, the role of trust as a mediator is analyzed to shed light upon its effect after the pandemic of COVID-19. As the academic sector has faced an abrupt shift to online formats, this study emphasizes on the role of leaders in fostering wellbeing for academic staff. This research emphasizes trust and work engagement as important elements for achieving positive employee outcomes within the context of sustainable psychology as a scientific domain. Through a specified approach, a sample of 138 people was collected from various faculty members and analyzed by SmartPLS. Results suggest a strong role played by servant leaders in improving the work engagement of their staff. Similarly, the mediating role of trust in a leader is statistically significant, implying its vitality for improving work engagement in an academic setting. These results can be beneficial for researchers (leadership and organizational psychology) and practitioners in the education sector.

Local level decisions that aim to promote trajectories toward desirable futures are often transformative, unexpectedly altering factors that are determined at higher regional levels. The converse also applies. The ability to realize desirable local futures diminishes if decision-making processes are not coordinated with other influential governance and decision levels. Providing effective support across multiple levels of decision making in a connected, transformative environment requires (a) identification and articulation of desired outcomes at the relevant levels of decision making, (b) improved understanding of complex cross-scale interactions that link to potentially transforming decisions, and (c) learning among decision makers and decision influencers. Research implemented through multiple participatory modalities can facilitate such relevant system learning to contribute to sustainable adaptation pathways. We test application of a systematic policy engagement framework, the Challenge and Reconstruct Learning or ChaRL framework, on a set of interdependent development decisions in the Mekong region. The analysis presented here is focused on the implementations of the ChaRL process in the Nam Ngum River Basin, Lao People's Democratic Republic and the Tonle Sap Lake and environs, Cambodia to exemplify what cross-scale and cross-sectoral insights were generated to inform decision-making processes in the wider Mekong region. The participatory process described aligns the facilitated development of scenarios articulating shared future visions at local and regional levels with agent-based simulations and facilitates learning by contrasting desired outcomes with likely, potentially maladaptive outcomes.

AB  - Indigenous peoples are experiencing a wide range of negative impacts due to climate change and should have the right to determine for themselves how to adapt to these changes and define successful adaptation. These adaptations can then be culturally appropriate and grounded in Indigenous knowledge systems; however, the accelerating rate of change in social-ecological systems can be a challenge for traditional knowledge. Appropriate participatory modeling tools such as agent-based models (ABMs) may be of assistance to Indigenous groups in thinking through how systems may change in the future. Using the Zimbabwe Agro-Pastoral Management Model (a community-based ABM cocreated with farmer-researchers in Mazvihwa Communal Area), we explored how different definitions of sustainability affected the conclusions from the model, including average annual harvest and the persistence of resources (livestock, harvest, and woodland biomass) in the modeled system above minimum thresholds. For very low persistence thresholds, these two measures of success traded off against each other (with higher cropland proportions favoring harvest success and lower cropland proportions favoring persistence success); and different combinations of management interventions favored one or the other definition of sustainability. New insights came from community suggestions of higher persistence thresholds for livestock, crops, and woodland, whereby the model suggested that an intermediate proportion of cropland could be most successful. In all cases, higher year-to-year rainfall variation reduced sustainability success, regardless of the definition or thresholds used. Cocreating, cotesting, and coadaptation of the model and the use of multiple definitions rendered the findings more relevant for local application. The community in Mazvihwa has many ways to adapt to challenging circumstances, and local nongovernmental organization The Muonde Trust has used the model to work with local leaders to support collective action on land use planning to protect woodland from deforestation.

AB  - Sustainability learning is gaining popularity as an important field within sustainability research, where farm sustainability can be understood as a learning process. In this study, we seek to reveal the sustainability learning process of farmers, utilizing a framework distinguishing contextual factors (where? and when?), knowledge (what?), motivation (why?), and process (how?). The article presents a participatory inquiry mixed-methods approach, utilizing results from sustainability assessments on five farms with the SMART-farm tool as a unifying starting point for further discussions on sustainability learning in farmers' interviews and stakeholder workshops. Empirically the study is set in the horticultural production in Arctic Norway, where few studies on sustainability have been undertaken. The study shows how both the complexity of the concept of farm sustainability and contextual factors influence the sustainability learning process, for instance by giving rise to a vast number of conflicting issues while working toward farm sustainability. The sustainability learning process is found to be predominantly a social learning process. The theoretic contribution of the study lies in its novel framework that can be used to reveal important aspects of the sustainability learning process, as well as to contribute to the literature on how to proceed from sustainability assessments to implementation. A key finding from the study is that farmers will require continuous assistance in their processes toward farm sustainability, but for this to be possible, knowledge, sources of knowledge, and learning platforms for holistic sustainability need to be established.

AB  - This study provides an exhaustive analysis of the intersection between gender-based violence and environmental sustainability, focusing on the Colombian experience, particularly within the context of armed conflict and migration. This analysis investigates the emerging area of research in Colombia that focuses on preventing gender-based violence from ecological and environmental viewpoints. Adopting a socio-ecological lens, this study highlights the ways in which women are disproportionately affected by gender-based violence and environmental challenges, particularly in contexts defined by conflict, displacement, poverty, and inadequate access to resources. Women in these contexts face direct violence and the compounded hardships associated with losing essential natural resources that sustain their families and communities. The review highlights addressing these intertwined challenges by empowering women as agents of socio-environmental transformation. It emphasizes the need for holistic interventions linking gender-based violence prevention with strategies for environmental protection, including initiatives tailored to local contexts. These interventions involve environmental education programs, the promotion of female leadership in conservation efforts, and the implementation of community-based projects driven by women, fostering their role as key drivers of sustainable change. Moreover, the research emphasizes the multifaceted consequences of armed conflict on Colombia's social and environmental systems, which further amplify the vulnerabilities of women and contribute to increased ecological decline. Addressing these issues jointly, it calls for public policies and programs adopting integrated socio-ecological perspectives to tackle gender-based violence and promote environmental sustainability. The proposed approach equips women with tools to combat violence and strengthens their capacity to contribute to environmental conservation and the establishment of resilient communities. This study advocates for a framework bridging gender-based violence prevention and environmental protection as a pathway to achieving inclusive, participatory, and sustainable peace. This strategy presents a viable structure for fostering enduring social and environmental improvements. Such an approach is particularly relevant for Colombia, where the legacy of conflict and displacement continues to pose significant challenges to both gender equality and ecological integrity.

AB  - This study analyses the Delta Project, an Urban Living Lab (ULL) implemented at the Faculty of Architecture and Urbanism (FAU) of the University of Guayaquil (UG), as an innovative educational strategy for sustainable development. It highlights the challenges in architecture education, focusing on the need to adapt to the demands of sustainability and technological advances. ULLs, in response to these challenges, are presented as dynamic platforms that combine research, innovation and policy to promote sustainability in urban and educational contexts. The methodology employs a case study approach, detailing how the Delta Project is integrated as a learning environment at FAU and its relationship to sustainability goals and education for sustainable development (ESD). The E-ULL-HEIs tool was used to assess seven key indicators: objectives and scope, diversity and stakeholder participation, interdisciplinarity, curricular integration, learning and research impact, community impact, and resources and sustainability. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews, documentary analysis and participatory observation. The results indicate that FAU has successfully integrated the Delta Project into its educational programmes, highlighting its impact on diversity and stakeholder participation, interdisciplinarity, curricular integration, and learning and research. The findings underline the effectiveness of the Delta Project in promoting ESD and its alignment with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, challenges were identified in terms of cross-sectoral collaboration and student participation, providing valuable lessons on the importance of strategic planning and adaptability. The study highlights the potential of the Delta Project model to be adapted and replicated in different cultural and academic contexts, suggesting the need for ongoing evaluations to improve the effectiveness of similar projects and promote ESD.

AB  - Successful implementation of sustainable innovation requires strong collaborative ecosystems. In particular, collaboration between scientific and people-centered expertise (e.g., designers) is essential to bring technical innovation through contextualized, meaningful and attractive experiences. However, in practice, these types of expertise are siloed and struggle to communicate and think together. We present a creative design method based on participatory story building to support collaborative user-centered ideation between technology scientists and designers. The core of the method is a new story creation model, the three-tension framework, that facilitates the exploration of users' experiences and needs during ideation. To evaluate the method's effectiveness, we conducted open-ended interviews with participants. We found that the method facilitates the expression of different perspectives and outside-the-box creative thinking. An originality and strength of our method is that it favors the discovery of new issues and pain points-rather than only solutions. This, combined with idea enrichment by multidisciplinary expertise, contributes to generating ideas in a broader range of application areas than usual. Our results indicate that participatory storytelling has the potential to facilitate multidisciplinary collaboration and to bring user-centered thinking to non-design stakeholders in order to envision user needs in future scenarios and new ecosystems.

AB  - The reformed Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), adopted by the European Union in 2013, aims to achieve sustainable exploitation of marine resources. Beyond the mainstream of stakeholders' engagement, the literature increasingly calls for shared accountability in fisheries management. In such scenarios, identifying stakeholders' insights becomes critical for a successful design of innovative management approaches. This paper analyses how the stakeholders perceive a results-based management system for four fisheries in different European sea-basins as well as at a pan-European level. The results indicate a need for adaptive and participatory management approaches, building on regional adaptations within transparent and plural frameworks for fisheries. To succeed, the system should explicitly address its associated public and private costs; neither participation nor accountability comes for free. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Mining companies are expected to return land to a stable, productive, and self-sustaining condition by rehabilitating degraded areas to also deliver social benefits, an essential dimension of sustainable land management. This research aimed to develop a framework for mine rehabilitation planning based on an integrated analysis of the social-ecological system provided by the ecosystem services concept to facilitate community engagement and the delivery of social benefits. An Ecosystem Services Assessment for Rehabilitation framework was tested at two bauxite mines undergoing ecological restoration. The mines are operated by the same company in two countries. Key results showed that the framework can help companies, regulators, and community members alike identify whether biophysical restoration efforts translate into key human benefits. Overall the framework provides a means for enhancing community engagement to explicitly address social benefits that, with a business as usual focus on ecological goals, may not be delivered. The ecosystem services concept provides a practical approach to link ecological and social outcomes of mine restoration.

AB  - "Co-design" has become a widely used approach in land use science to address complex sustainability challenges. However, the term "co-design" is applied in quite different contexts, often implying different meanings and practices to implementation which leads to terminological fuzziness. Since an overview and synthesis of these different approaches is still missing, this systematic review aims at shedding light on the different meanings of "co-design," systematizing the body of literature on land use sciences, and exploring how scientists and experts implement co-design processes in practice. Applying a quantitative meta-analysis of 88 SCOPUS-listed publi-cations, we identified two main objectives and types for conducting co-design research: Seventy-six studies aim at jointly developing problem-solving interventions for sustainable transformations ("intervention type"), whereas 12 studies seek to collaboratively develop research questions or agendas (type: "co-created research designs"). Using a qualitative in-depth analysis, we further divide the "intervention type" corpus into four subtypes: (a) "researcher-led and model-based" and (b) "social science-driven intervention" studies applying a rigorous pre-defined study design where scientists are the dominant actors. Subtype (c) includes studies that develop "design-led and practice-oriented interventions" and rather focus on practical outcomes than on sci-entific knowledge production. The subtype (d) "transformative transdisciplinary interventions and living labs" shows the strongest ties to transdisciplinary research philosophy, theory, methodology, and practice. Co-citation -network analyses reveal that these subtypes have partly evolved independently from each other by using different theoretical and methodological references. Generally, "co-design" is applied in various ways, but without an agreement on what exactly "co-design" entails. It is often used intuitively across the subtypes, without carefully reflecting the existing theoretical and methodological foundations. Finally, we provide suggestions for supporting an integration of "co-design" into future research projects in a more conscious and sound way.

AB  - Real-world laboratories (RwLs) as a new format within transdisciplinary science aim at promoting learning for and transformation towards sustainability. However, what are essential aspects to take into account while initiating and stabilizing such processes within RwLs? Comparing lessons learned of three German RwLs (BaWu Labs), we show that for establishing RwLs as melting pots for transdisciplinary research and societal transformation, four properties are crucial: an interior design that enables transdisciplinary research and intervention (in particular real-world experiments) based on a stable infrastructure; sustainability as guiding and operationalized principle for differentiating the format "RwL" from other labs; overarching research programs for assessing transformative effects of RwLs and didactic concepts suitable for RwL circumstances. Since RwLs mainly address a long-term cultural change, a long-term funding and research structure are essential as well.

AB  - Background: Environmental Social Governance (ESG) investment had entered a phase of rapid development in the past few decades as most nations had put forward "carbon neutral" initiatives. ESG would receive more attention from the industry and academia in a global environment full of uncertainties. Companies benefit from the sharing of ESG data by improving their brand image, which attracts funding, lowers financing costs, and increases valuation.Purpose: To explore how ESG drives corporate financial performance. Also, the research examines the interrelation of ESG presentation and corporate presentation.Design: /methodology/approach: Over an interval of 10 years (2011-2020) using a sample of 3332 listed organizations worldwide. The theory of the research is on the basis of stakeholder and transmitting signal theory and multiple regression and categorized regression were applied with STATA 16.0 software.Results: The study utilizes a large dataset of 24,076 valid observations, providing robust statistical power for the analysis. The study findings proved that ESG performance is positively interrelated with corporate performance (p < 0.01). According to the findings of the study, at 1% of the level related to significance (p < 0.01), the regression coefficient for ESG is considerably positive. Thus, the influence of ESG rating on corporate performance is significant for large-scale companies and insignificant for small-scale companies. The results demonstrate that the positive impact of ESG rating on corporate financial performance is more pronounced in the high risk case than in the low risk case (p < 0.01). The results highlight the importance of ESG performance in today's world. Overall, the study gives precious perception about the interrelation between ESG and corporate financial performance (CFP).Policy implications: The researchers believe that the results of this study are beneficial to companies and governments in the development of environmentally conscious industries since they demonstrate corporate success through ESG. More realistically, the ESG can boost corporate firm performance by enabling businesses to maintain sustainability, establish a solid reputation, win the trust of stakeholders, and contribute to solving national sustainable development issues. Additionally, the researchers believe that the results of this study can boost management effectiveness, which in turn can help firms succeed.Originality/value: In the context of environmentally sensitive industries, this study findings provide empirical insights to the association between the corporate firms success and ESG performance. In addition, the findings provide insights to the business organizations development and the significance of ESG integration in the business organizations.

AB  - Several socio-environmental conditions (economic, ecological, geopolitical, institutional, psychological, or engineering vulnerability, among many others) are putting at risk and violating numerous communities. In this panorama, technology is assuming more and more the potentiality to become (1) one of the main drivers for change or (2) a creator of greater and deeper socio-environmental gaps. Moreover, technology adaptation is a process which takes difficulties, risks, and complexities that must be considered and addressed by all the actors, who participate in those processes of sustainable transformation. To take into account the challenges and opportunities that the processes of transfer and adaptation may have in vulnerable communities, this paper conducts a systematic review of the main existing scientific and academic literature on the role of technological resources in vulnerable communities (impacts, benefits, risks, etc.). In order to achieve this purpose, a bibliographic study is carried out in the most important bibliographic databases under the methodological proposal Scoping Review. A first analysis focuses on: annual behavior, disciplines, main addressed issues, institutions, and countries funding and supporting research on these topics. The research analyses also the main dimensions of vulnerabilities considered by academic literature and the technological resources, which usually these research projects refer to. The research conclusions aim to guide future research on the technological implications in vulnerable communities and to identify research opportunities, with a particular focus on design and architecture studies.

AB  - Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a foundational method for quantitative assessment of sustainability. Increasing data availability and rapid development of machine learning (ML) approaches offer new opportunities to advance LCA. Here, we review current progress and knowledge gaps in applying ML techniques to support LCA, and identify future research directions for LCAs to better harness the power of ML. This review analyzes forty studies reporting quantitative assessment with a combination of LCA and ML methods. We found that ML approaches have been used for generating life cycle inventories, computing characterization factors, estimating life cycle impacts, and supporting life cycle interpretation. Most of the reviewed studies employed a single ML method, with artificial neural networks (ANNs) as the most frequently applied approach. Both supervised and unsupervised ML techniques were used in LCA studies. For studies using supervised ML, training datasets were derived from diverse sources, such as literature, lab experiments, existing databases, and model simulations. Over 70 % of these reviewed studies trained ML models with less than 1500 sample datasets. Although these reviewed studies showed that ML approaches help improve prediction accuracy, pattern discovery and computational efficiency, multiple areas deserve further research. First, continuous data collection and compilation is needed to support more reliable ML and LCA modeling. Second, future studies should report sufficient details regarding the selection criteria for ML models and present model uncertainty analysis. Third, incorporating deep learning models into LCA holds promise to further improve life cycle inventory and impact assessment. Finally, the complexity of current environmental challenges calls for interdisciplinary collaborative research to achieve deep integration of ML into LCA to support sustainable development.

AB  - The challenges of integrated, adaptive and ecosystem management are leading government agencies to adopt participatory modes of engagement. Collaborative governance is a form of participation in which stakeholders co-produce goals and strategies and share responsibilities and resources. We assess the potential and challenges of collaborative governance as a mechanism to provide an integrated, ecosystem approach to natural resource management, using red deer in Scotland as a case study. Collaborative Deer Management Groups offer a well-established example of a 'bridging organisation', intended to reduce costs and facilitate decision making and learning across institutions and scales. We examine who initiates collaborative processes and why, what roles different actors adopt and how these factors influence the outcomes, particularly at a time of changing values, management and legislative priorities. Our findings demonstrate the need for careful consideration of where and how shared responsibility might be best implemented and sustained as state agencies often remain key to the process, despite the partnership intention. Differing interpretations between agencies and landowners of the degree of autonomy and division of responsibilities involved in 'collaboration' can create tension, while the diversity of landowner priorities brings additional challenges for defining shared goals in red deer management and in other cases. Effective maintenance depends on appropriate role allocation and adoption of responsibilities, definition of convergent values and goals, and establishing communication and trust in institutional networks. Options that may help private stakeholders offset the costs of accepting responsibility for delivering public benefits need to be explicitly addressed to build capacity and support adaptation. This study indicates that collaborative governance has the potential to help reconcile statutory obligations with stakeholder empowerment. The potential of collaboration to reduce the costs of sustainable management remains contentious and, in times of increasing resource constraints, the potential mismatch between resource investment and anticipated goals is likely to become a critical issue, which may challenge the goals and capacity of the state and existing managers.

AB  - Non-technical summary Transdisciplinary sustainability scientists work with many different actors in pursuit of change. In so doing they make choices about why and how to engage with different perspectives in their research. Reflexivity - active individual and collective critical reflection - is considered an important capacity for researchers to address the resulting ethical and practical challenges. We developed a framework for reflexivity as a transformative capacity in sustainability science through a critical systems approach, which helps make any decisions that influence which perspectives are included or excluded in research explicit. We suggest that transdisciplinary sustainability research can become more transformative by nurturing reflexivity.Technical summary Transdisciplinary sustainability science is increasingly applied to study transformative change. Yet, transdisciplinary research involves diverse actors who hold contrasting and sometimes conflicting perspectives and worldviews. Reflexivity is cited as a crucial capacity for navigating the resulting challenges, yet notions of reflexivity are often focused on individual researcher reflections that lack explicit links to the collective transdisciplinary research process and predominant modes of inquiry in the field. This gap presents the risk that reflexivity remains on the periphery of sustainability science and becomes 'unreflexive', as crucial dimensions are left unacknowledged. Our objective was to establish a framework for reflexivity as a transformative capacity in sustainability science through a critical systems approach. We developed and refined the framework through a rapid scoping review of literature on transdisciplinarity, transformation, and reflexivity, and reflection on a scenario study in the Red River Basin (US, Canada). The framework characterizes reflexivity as the capacity to nurture a dynamic, embedded, and collective process of self-scrutiny and mutual learning in service of transformative change, which manifests through interacting boundary processes - boundary delineation, interaction, and transformation. The case study reflection suggests how embedding this framework in research can expose boundary processes that block transformation and nurture more reflexive and transformative research.Social media summary Transdisciplinary sustainability research may become more transformative by nurturing reflexivity as a dynamic, embedded, and collective learning process.

AB  - The establishment of industrial parks has functioned as a catalyst for sustained economic growth and industrial advancement in Nigeria, mirroring trends observed in industrialized countries globally. However, no attention has been given to the conversion of existing industrial parks to eco-industrial parks (EIPs) to address the environmental challenges caused by increased industrialization in the country. This paper presents an assessment of opportunities for environmental protection through eco-industrial transformation in Nigeria, specifically focusing on the case of Sharada Industrial Park (SIP). The study applies the international eco-industrial park (EIP) framework to evaluate the current and intended performance of the park and identify opportunities for its conversion into an EIP, through an on-site tour of the park and interviews with the park managers. Similarly, questionnaires were used to assess the readiness of eco-industrial transformation in the country. The assessment of SIP's performance against the EIP framework reveals a concerning lack of compliance, with only 39 % of the performance indicators being met. This translates to several issues including resource inefficiency, increased pollution, higher operating costs and environmental non-compliance for the resident industries in SIP. Key opportunities for the transformation of SIP into an EIP were identified, including the diversity of industries in the park, existing infrastructure and renewable energy integration. These opportunities represent the potential for the establishment of sustainable industrial ecosystems in Nigeria. Tailored strategies for compliance, including policy reforms and stakeholder engagement, are recommended to drive eco-industrial transformation and foster a sustainable and circular manufacturing sector in Nigeria. It is also recommended that future research should investigate the drivers and barriers of industrial symbiosis (IS) and circular economy practices within industrial parks, alongside material flow analysis to determine synergy opportunities.

AB  - Until now, monitoring of large-scale regional funding programmes has been rare, although their large scope and abstract planning targets generally involve high levels of uncertainty. This study applies and examines a newly developed methodological approach for monitoring such programmes. It also critically reflects to what extent the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) contributes to a better consideration of environmental sustainability and to a learning effect among the stakeholders as well as within the decision-making process. The interviews conducted during the SEA monitoring revealed a very low recognition of the SEA, and its content, among project applicants of the transnational regional funding programme. They further show that more information on the SEA and its recommendations to mitigate negative environmental impacts would be beneficial in the future. Overall, the monitoring confirmed, however, that the institutions responsible for the programme were aware of the benefits of considering environmental sustainability. The long-term application of SEA in an iterative process provided positive learning effects on environmental sustainability and awareness for environmental aspects. This study also shows how SEA monitoring can serve as a tool to enhance visibility and foster communication among decision makers and applicants.

AB  - Ecosystem services have become a mainstream concept for the expression of values assigned by people to various functions of ecosystems. Even though the introduction of the concept has initiated a vast amount of research, progress in using this knowledge for sustainable resource use remains insufficient. We see a need to broaden the scope of research to answer three key questions that we believe will improve incorporation of ecosystem service research into decision-making for the sustainable use of natural resources to improve human well-being: (i) how are ecosystem services co-produced by social-ecological systems, (ii) who benefits from the provision of ecosystem services, and (iii) what are the best practices for the governance of ecosystem services? Here, we present these key questions, the rationale behind them, and their related scientific challenges in a globally coordinated research programme aimed towards improving sustainable ecosystem management. These questions will frame the activities of ecoSERVICES, formerly a DIVERSITAS project and now a project of Future Earth, in its role as a platform to foster global coordination of multidisciplinary sustainability science through the lens of ecosystem services.

AB  - The paper describes the process, approach and results of participatory based biodiversity learning and creation of an environment among children and traditional healers, pastoralists and wisemen for making the knowledge network. In this endeavor, the students have been collaborated with the farmers by taking the help of regional transfer of technology centers. These students have led the campaign in organizing biodiversity contests among school children and learning with village community. The objective behind the effort was to inculcate the interest among college and school children towards biodiversity use and conservation and thereby reduce the rate of knowledge erosion with the help of local wisdom. The paper introduces issue of collaborative learning on biodiversity between children and village wise men and reflects some lessons learned about the knowledge networking in the society. It also discusses some possible factors behind creation of good environment of learning between wise men and children in forms of participatory approaches applied. The obtained results will support the participatory biodiversity based education and learning programmes for the sustainable development.

AB  - Disease management is an approach to patient care that coordinates medical resources for the patient across the entire healthcare delivery system throughout the lifetime of the patient with the disease. Stroke is suitable for disease management as it is a well-known disease with a high prevalence, high cost, variable practice pattern, poor clinical outcome, and managed by a non-integrated healthcare system. It has measurable and actionable outcomes, with available local expertise and support of the Ministry of Health. Developing the programme requires a multidisciplinary team, baseline data on target populations and healthcare services, identification of core components, collaboration with key stakeholders, development of evidence-based clinical practice guidelines and carepaths, institution of care coordinators, use of information technology and continuous quality improvement to produce an affective plait. Core components include public education, risk factor screening and management, primary care and specialist clinics, acute stroke units, inpatient and outpatient rehabilitation facilities, and supportive community services including medical, nursing, therapy, home help and support groups for patients and carers. The family physician plays a key role. Coordination of services is best done by a network of hospital and community-based care managers, and is enhanced by a coordinating call centre. Continuous quality improvement is required, with audit of processes and outcomes, facilitated by a disease registry. Pitfalls include inappropriate exclusion of deserving patients, misuse, loss of physician and patient independence, over-estimation of benefits, and care fragmentation. Collaboration and cooperative among all parties will help ensure a successful and sustainable programme.

AB  - To be successfully and sustainably adopted, policy-makers, service managers and practitioners want public programmes to be affordable and cost-effective, as well as effective. While the realist evaluation question is often summarised as what works for whom, under what circumstances, we believe the approach can be as salient to answering questions about resource use, costs and cost-effectiveness - the traditional domain of economic evaluation methods. This paper first describes the key similarities and differences between economic evaluation and realist evaluation. It summarises what health economists see as the challenges of evaluating complex interventions, and their suggested solutions. We then use examples of programme theory from a recent realist review of shared care for chronic conditions to illustrate two ways in which realist evaluations might better capture the resource requirements and resource consequences of programmes, and thereby produce explanations of how they are linked to outcomes (i.e. explanations of cost-effectiveness).

AB  - Soil conservation service (SCS), one of the vital ecosystem services, represents the ecosystem's capacity to conserve soil and control erosion. Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) requires multidisciplinary efforts in which SCS plays a key role. However, the coupling analysis of SCS and the SDGs is lacking. We analysed SCS's contribution to the SDGs by a case study in China and a global expert questionnaire and explored systematic strategies to improve SCS implementation. The results showed that i) SCS ensures the SDG achievement by mitigating soil erosion; ii) SCS showed a significant and positive relationship (coef. = 0.41, p < 0.01) with SDG 15 (Life on land) in China. Moreover, SCS supports multiple SDGs by regulating ecological processes, producing food and products, and providing social and cultural values. More than 50% of respondents recognised that SCS benefits SDG 15, SDG 13 (Climate Action), and SDG 6 (Clean water and sanitation). Finally, to be goal-oriented, we presented an SDG-holistic guiding framework to promote SCS for the SDG achievement, thus harnessing the SCS's roles in social, economic, and eco-environmental sustainability. Altogether, our work highlights the associations between the SDGs and SCS, which is key to recognising the contribution of soils and ESs to sustainable development.

AB  - Significant shifts are occurring in higher education pedagogy, research methodology, and community development, ones that value civic engagement and experiential learning as bridges to holistic education and sustainable social change. Engaged scholarship through university-community partnerships can result in providing a well-rounded education for students, a widening of the university's knowledge base, and an empowering investment in community change. Yet, perpetuating unequal power relations and contributing to a deficit-based approach of service can thwart the social change efforts of community-based education. Critically engaging these complex notions, while integrating promising pedagogical practices, is crucial for effective service-learning and community-based research. This paper provides an overview of these topics and the personal and collective challenges and benefits students, faculty, and communities face as a result of campus-community partnerships.

AB  - Predetermined professional development (PD) programmes delivered by external experts are the usual approach to enhancing the teaching of physical education (PE) in disadvantaged school contexts. This generally does not result in sustained learning and development once the PE professionals withdraw. Addressing the lack of teacher- and context-driven PD, we propose an evidence-based, collaborative, and transformative PD approach that involves teachers themselves in designing, implementing, and evaluating ongoing learning opportunities suited to their context. To enable teachers to improve their practice in a sustainable manner, we adopted a participatory action learning and action research design, using qualitative data generation tools. With this article we report on the first cycle, namely that of action and reflection, where teachers generated and analysed qualitative data to identify their learning needs. Four themes emerged, namely (1) the need to interpret and adapt the Curriculum and Assessment Policy Statement (CAPS) (2); ability to teach PE in their specific low-resource context while; (3) generating support from colleagues and management, and (4) coping with systemic issues impacting on their teaching. We discuss the implications of these needs for the continuing PD of teachers.

AB  - The goal of this work was to evaluate the socio-economic and environmental life cycle advantages of alternative defossilization pathways for a bio-based industrial network in Central Germany. Five scenarios were defined considering the potential energy utilization of further regionally available biomass capacities. The evaluation was made using an integrated approach, i.e., using a traditional life cycle assessment methodology, complemented by a regionalized socio-economic life cycle assessment framework. The results show that the environmental advantages from the change in energy provisioning reduced about 5% of the total environmental impacts. The analysis of the socio-economic impacts shows that the path to defossilization of the integrated network provides a clear enhancement of the expected regional socio-economic impacts. These results show that 100% decoupling from natural gas brings overall positive sustainability advantages to all organizations participating in the evaluated value chains.

AB  - In many transdisciplinary research settings, a lack of attention to the values underpinning project aims can inhibit stakeholder engagement and ultimately slow or undermine project outcomes. As a research collective (The Careoperative), we have developed a set of four shared values through a facilitated visioning process, as central to the way we work together: care, reflexivity, inclusivity, and collectivity. In this paper, we explore the implications of a values-centered approach to collaboration in food system transformation research. The paper presents two cases that illustrate how researchers might approach centering values in practice. Where much research on food system transformation focuses on values of food system stakeholders, we contribute insights into the values of researchers in such transdisciplinary endeavors. Specifically, we argue that researchers working on sustainability transformations need to be better prepared to engage in such reflections and aspire to embody values aligned with the transformations they seek to research.

AB  - Understanding the relationship between job characteristics and participation in adult learning is essential for fostering sustainable development. This study explores how employment factors such as job characteristics, work autonomy, and required skills influence participation in adult learning, which is important for economic resilience and social cohesion. The research utilizes data from the 2021 Labor Force Survey (LFS) in Slovenia, examining adults aged 25-64 and their participation in formal and non-formal education. Findings reveal significant correlations between employment status, type of contract, company size, and adult learning participation. Specifically, individuals in larger companies and those with flexible working hours are more likely to engage in educational activities. Additionally, the ability to work from home is strongly associated with higher participation rates in adult education, highlighting the role of flexible work arrangements in promoting lifelong learning. These insights underscore the importance of creating supportive job environments and equitable access to educational resources to achieve sustainable economic growth and reduce inequalities. By addressing the factors that influence adult learning, policymakers and organizations can develop strategies to enhance workforce adaptability and lifelong learning, ultimately contributing to the broader goals of sustainable development.

AB  - At the crossroads of innovation and responsibility, our study delves into CSR's pivotal role in steering organizations toward sustainable value creation. Combining the frameworks of stakeholder theory, the resource-based view, and dynamic capabilities theory, this study examines the influence of corporate social responsibility (CSR) in enhancing sustainable value creation (SVC), with a keen focus on how organizational learning (OL) and innovation capability (IC) mediate this relationship and the degree to which stakeholder engagement (SE) moderates the impact of CSR on OL, IC, and SVC. Using a quantitative research approach, 416 managers in the Turkish manufacturing sector (e.g., textiles, building materials, and food processing firms) were surveyed using electronic and physical questionnaires. To test the research model, AMOS 24 was employed. The results confirmed that CSR positively influences SVC, OL, and IC; OL and IC positively influence SVC; OL and IC partially mediate the relationship between CSR and SVC. Likewise, the findings suggest that stakeholder engagement (SE) plays a moderate role in strengthening the relationship between CSR and organizational learning (OL), CSR and innovation capability (IC), and CSR and sustainable value creation (SVC), with increased SE enhancing the positive effect of CSR on OL, IC, and SVC. This study explains the complex ways that CSR enhances SVC, focusing on OL and IC's mediating roles and SE's moderating effects. It offers manufacturing sectors in Turkey useful information for promoting sustainability and innovation.

AB  - When evaluating the practices of public participation, one should understand how the participatory process is conceived and implemented. Although many studies have been conducted in this regard, there is hardly a study that used Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as the basis for evaluation. In this study, we examine the participatory process of a public participation practice in Indonesia, called Musrenbang, at the village level, applying an SDGs' based assessment. Using the case of the Deli Serdang district, we investigate the participatory process based on SDG indicators 11.3.2 and 16.7.2, applying a set of criteria suggested by various scholars. The results show a misalignment between the Musrenbang practice and the evaluation criteria due to key problems such as planning schedules that do not meet regulations, lack of knowledge integration and learning processes, as well as power struggles amongst stakeholders.

AB  - Teaching green chemistry to chemistry students is necessary in order to raise up a new generation of responsible scientists, highly motivated to implement sustainable development of the human race. This subject is mostly driven by a few enthusiastic individuals and organizations, both worldwide and in Russia, and sometimes is referred in the literature as teaching sustainability. Russian experience proves that students who successfully participate in high-level chemistry Olympiads (such as International Mendeleev Chemistry Olympiad), have stronger motivation to study the subject and show higher scores during their first years at university. Some elements of green chemistry are included in Olympiad assignments. They are included in the curricula of all departments of Lomonosov Moscow State University related to chemistry and concentrated in the elective courses. The described project approach consists in analysis of the "greenness" of the research work, performed by students for diploma dissertation. The aim of the approach is to increase students' motivation to further use of green chemistry principles in the routine research activity. Wider dissemination of green chemistry ideas is achieved by online teaching.

AB  - Alternative food networks (AFNs) are commonly defined by attributes of local production and short supply chains, which integrate dimensions of spatial and social proximity. This new form of food chain is emerging as a response to the crisis in conventional agribusiness. This article presents a systematic review of the academic literature on the alternative food network and short supply chain in order to understand the main elements and topics explored in the empirical studies conducted from 2014 to 2021. This review only considers research using a single or multiple case study approaches. The Scopus and Web of Science databases were used for the literature search. The identification and eligibility processes were performed following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta Analysis (PRISMA) method. Six core topics were identified: motivation of actors; collaborative governance; social relations and trust; sustainability; boundary negotiation; and resilience. Most of the studies were developed in European countries. The results show that motivation to join the AFN and sustainability are the more explored topics, followed by the study of the different models of governance that characterize the AFN. In addition, the connection between different actors emerges, in a transversal manner, as an important pillar of AFNs. AFN features may change depending on social-economical, cultural, and geographical factors. There is therefore a need to explore other forms of AFNs; future research should conduct cross-analysis on AFNs in different countries and socio-economic contexts.

AB  - Despite the recognized importance of transdisciplinarity, including art-science collaborations, for tackling the complex challenges of the Anthropocene, little is known about the internal mechanisms of such alliances. At its best, transdisciplinarity should involve social learning with transformative potential. However, we still need evidence on how this can be achieved, specifically regarding developing interpersonal interactions and group dynamics. Our study explored the social learning processes and outcomes of an art-science encounter, aiming to highlight such a collaboration's internal barriers and enhancers. It took place within a science communication project for the European Performing Science Night 2021, which involved creating an immersive artistic installation through the collaboration of 28 artists and scientists. We analyzed the social learning processes and outcomes based on participants' profiles, individual participation, group dynamics, and the workshop context using structured interviews and participatory observation during this two-week co-creation workshop. Our insights showed that inter-relational skills were among the most important outcomes, and social learning processes varied based on group dynamics. Moreover, we identified the presence of a delicate balance between driving egalitarian and self-regulated dynamics within inclusive, collaborative processes and the need to foster non-hierarchical structures and dismantle power dynamics between artists and scientists. We discuss these findings in light of three key elements: destabilization, immersion, and materialization, which can help overcome internal barriers and leverage strengths for facilitating transdisciplinary approaches that contribute to sustainability transformations.

AB  - Sustainability research benefits from having an interdisciplinary orientation, as understanding and developing solutions to the grand challenges we confront is not the domain of any one discipline. Even though often falling short in practice, this ideal has undergirded the efforts of sustainability research, and promoted the increasing recognition of the relevance and unique insights that social science has to offer. Pointing to a significant imbalance in funding allocation between the natural and social sciences, Overland and Sovacool, in this Journal, recently challenge the notion that these two represent increasingly equal partners for sustainability research. Although we applaud and are in fundamental agreement with their arguments, we contend that framing of respect and recognition in terms of funding alone may be misleading, and can replicate and reproduce the exact imbalances that it seeks to redress. This Perspective aims to complement the insights of Overland and Sovacool by making an examination of the kinds of organizational and institutional factors preventing a fuller integration of social sciences within sustainability research. Writing from the perspective of social scientists involved in interdisciplinary research projects, this more bottom-up perspective sheds light on: the ongoing imbalance between the social and natural sciences, how and why the status quo is reproduced for structural and cultural reasons, and how transformation along the two dimensions can be achieved. The resulting solutions are relevant for not only other social scientists, but all concerned with developing robust and constructive answers to societally pressing questions.

AB  - Responsible consumption and production patterns have been defined as a stand-alone Sustainable Development Goal, hence ensuring its achievement sits high on national and international policy agendas. Getting a better understanding of food consumer behavior towards sustainable patterns could help achieve this goal. This study aims to address this issue by exploring drivers and barriers to sustainable dairy consumption in Vietnam. It also identifies potential policy interventions that could promote more sustainable dairy consumption. To achieve these, the research carried out five focus groups and adopted the Capability-Opportunity-Motivation Behavior model and the Behavior Change Wheel. The analysis explores 32 drivers and 14 barriers influencing sustainable dairy consumption behavior. Health, brand and product quality, family, and promotion are the most prominent drivers, while price, habits, and taste are the most prominent barriers. The findings show that though the awareness and level of sustainable dairy consumption are still low, there is a positive trend toward sustainable dairy consumption in Vietnam. The study also identifies several intervention actions for policymakers, firm managers, and other supply chain decision-makers. These are related to building capability, increasing motivation, and promoting opportunities. Vietnam's results are similar to the findings of other research conducted in Europe, hence reinforcing the existing literature on sustainable food consumption. While consolidating the current state of the art, the study is particularly relevant to decision-makers and practitioners in Vietnam in achieving food sustainability policy goals.

AB  - It is necessary for national parks to exert multiple forms of influence. One innovative function of national parks is leisure and recreation. By optimizing the recreation function, national parks can enhance public participation and tourists' willingness to pay to achieve sustainable development. This paper surveys 435 tourists in Wuyishan National Park with a discrete choice experiment, applies mixed logit models to explore their preferences for recreational attributes from three dimensions and analyzes the heterogeneity. The findings indicate that attributes such as the number of concession activities, transportation variety, the density of recreational facilities, biodiversity, sightseeing zone and combined ticket fee significantly impact tourists' willingness to pay. Higher-educated, younger and willing-to-revisit tourists are more likely to pay for the park and hope to optimize the facilities and activities. The estimated recreational value of the park is RMB 164.51 (about USD 22.75) per person. Here, heterogeneity exist: higher-educated tourists ask for lager sightseeing zone, younger ones prefer more diverse activities and those who are willing to revisit incline to variety means of transportation.

AB  - The idea of 'Sustainability as a Real Utopia' elaborated on here adapts sociologist Erik Olin Wright's emancipatory social science and is a heuristic informed by critical realism and social theory for interdisciplinary research on viable alternatives that move society towards achieving sustainability. Starting from the proposition that many environmental problems are rooted in how social structures and institutions interact with nature by shaping human agency, we argue for concretely situated analysis aimed at guiding human agency towards changing those root causes. Then, drawing on concrete examples from sustainability research, we elaborate on three central tasks: diagnosing and critiquing environmental problems, elaborating viable alternatives and proposing a theory of transformation. Finally, we discuss, and welcome dialogue around two central and interlinked challenges of our approach to transformative sustainability research: that of scales, and that of the distinction and relationship between reforms and transformation.

AB  - This paper looks at ways of improving agricultural service provision to rural producers through the adoption and integration of innovative tools for managing producer organizations in Mali. It considers a bottom-up approach to agricultural service provision and the factors that enable it to be scaled up efficiently. It demonstrates that building on complementarities between partners and adopting a needs-based approach creates relatively greater social impact. Our case study links the practical experience of a programme to the wider theoretical framework of social capital. We conclude that delivering affordable agricultural services to promote rural entrepreneurship in Mali will depend on (i) strategically incorporating past successes into programme interventions, (ii) building strong partnerships that foster complementarities, (iii) setting specific targets that empower all rural stakeholders, and (iv) establishing internal arrangements that ensure sustainability.

AB  - Biomass has attracted considerable attention from both researchers and practitioners as an important renewable energy source that can help achieve sustainable development. However, inefficient biomass logistics systems hinder the development of biomass utilisation. This study investigates a two-echelon biomass resource location-routing problem (2E-BRLRP). Considering a predetermined supply of biomass resources, a mixed integer programming model for the 2EBRLRP is established to determine the best locations for biomass collection facilities and corresponding vehicle routes. To address the computational complexity, a hybrid heuristic algorithm that embeds variable neighbourhood search into the tabu search framework is developed. A set of comprehensive computational examples are used to test the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach. (c) 2020 IAgrE. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper focuses on sustainability evaluation and, more specifically, it describes and analyses the Indicator-based Framework for Evaluation of Natural Resource Management Systems (MESMIS, its Spanish acronym), ten years after its development. This framework fulfilled a pioneering role by proposing an integrated interdisciplinary approach to assess sustainability of peasant NRMS. Results of a thorough analysis of 28 case studies are presented, to seek improvement to the methods. The MESMIS approach is acceptable to a wide range of systems and to stakeholders; it has greatly assisted in sustainability evaluation and has increased understanding of the complexity of such systems, making it a significant tool for sustainability evaluation. The degree to which MESMIS and evaluation in general was shown to be an effective tool in reaching more sustainable systems depended mainly on the type of participation applied; additional guidance and information on participation is essential. Improvement possibilities are further directed to exploration and incorporation into the framework of 'new' tools that have proved valuable for the monitoring and integration of indicators (i.e. simulation models, linear programming and trade-off analysis), tools capable of assessing effects of management on indicators in the long term and thereby increasing the understanding of system attributes.

AB  - Participatory research in which experts and non-experts are co-researchers in addressing local concerns (also known as participatory action research or community-based research) can be a valuable approach for dealing with the uncertainty of social-ecological systems because it fosters learning among stakeholders and co-production of knowledge. Despite its increased application in the context of natural resources and environmental management, evaluation of participatory research has received little attention. The objectives of this research were to define criteria to evaluate participatory research processes and outcomes, from the literature on participation evaluation, and to apply them in a case study in an artisanal fishery in coastal Uruguay. Process evaluation criteria (e.g., problem to be addressed of key interest to local and additional stakeholders; involvement of interested stakeholder groups in every research stage; collective decision making through deliberation; and adaptability through iterative cycles) should be considered as conditions to promote empowering participatory research. Our research contributes to knowledge on evaluation of participatory research, while also providing evidence of the positive outcomes of this approach, such as co-production of knowledge, learning, strengthened social networks, and conflict resolution.

AB  - This article looks at a challenge-based learning (CBL) approach that aims to engage students in sustainable transitions within urban and regional planning. Drawing on CBL, we focus on how living labs - the idea of using a city as a site for user-driven innovation and development - can be used as a site and methodology in education and research on planning for sustainability. The paper presents insight from teaching planning master's students and a living lab initiative in Linkoping, Sweden. We aim to contribute to research on how to teach sustainable transitions within urban and regional planning by focusing on CBL and propose a methodology using a challenge-driven living lab aimed at supporting sustainable transformation learning. We mean that educational engagement with living lab approaches can be both a study tool and potentially an arena for change. Our experiences from teaching a living lab exercise illustrate the value of working with challenge based-learning approaches and "real-life" challenges, the added value from projects consisting of various actors including external groups, and the need for constructive peer-based and student-led learning. We suggest that a challenge-driven living lab methodology can be useful in teaching sustainable transformation in Geography and Planning and have wider implications.

AB  - How does a small firm achieve sustainable innovation in a low-and medium-technology (LMT) sector as a market niche? Based on an exploratory case study, we find that Allbirds, a footwear startup, and its collaborators in the value chain in Korea, achieved sustainable innovation in sustainability branding (the total carbon footprint of footwear) and architectural innovation (a new integral design of the upper portion of footwear). We also find that Allbirds leverages various complementors' resources and capabilities across the value chain. Based on the results, we introduce an interpretive framework that explains a sustainable innovation in an LMT sector, driven by a small firm's efforts at collaboration with external stakeholders, centering on an architectural and radical mar-keting innovation, specifically, emphasizing the use of intra-and transsectoral knowledge. This study deepens understanding of sustainable innovation in the context of small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) in an LMT sector.

AB  - This research investigates how professional designers engage with sustainability in their practices, focusing on the early ideation phase. A comprehensive literature review identified gaps in existing tools and methods, highlighting a lack of practical guidance for addressing sustainability within organisational and societal contexts. Semi-structured interviews with design practitioners provided insights into the challenges designers face, including conflicting stakeholder priorities, greenwashing, and the need for alignment across diverse perspectives. A co-creation session further refined these insights, leading to the development of the Tactical Sustainability Cards-a tool designed to inspire sustainable thinking, guide decision-making, and foster collaboration. The Tactical Sustainability Cards were validated through expert feedback and iterative refinement, emphasising their utility in overcoming limitations of existing Design for Sustainability (DfS) tools, such as complexity and narrow focus. By providing actionable prompts and a shared language, the cards empower designers to navigate sustainability challenges, align stakeholders, and justify sustainable initiatives effectively. This research contributes to bridging the gap between sustainability theory and practice by offering a practical tool that integrates sustainability into design processes. The findings lay a foundation for future work exploring the broader applicability of the cards and elaborate on the potential for design to harmonise innovation and sustainability, addressing the environmental and societal challenges.

AB  - Urban living labs is a practical methodology in improving sustainability in cities by facilitating collaborative learning and innovation in a real-life environment, thereby mainly responding to the needs of users (citizens). The paper aims to filter a list of key learnings on urban living labs through the lens of Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI). One of the motivations is that key learnings on urban living labs are mainly derived from means-goal effectiveness (MGE) thinking while the urban setting calls for a broader perspective due to complexity and tension from the multi-actor, multifunctional, and multi-scalar character of cities. The filtering reveals almost 40 learnings as overlap' and exclusive for MGE'. Importantly, five learnings are identified as specific for RRI and potentially enriching living lab methodology: ethical and normative principles like health, safety, security, and equality between societal groups, and a wider distribution of benefits and risks of living lab outcomes, in particular, contradictory sustainability issues. The RRI filtering causes three practical implications: coping with uneven power distribution between stakeholders, limited feasibility of applying the comprehensive learning framework, and challenges of overarching platform structures enabling to better incorporate RRI concerns in living lab methodology. The findings as presented in an adapted list are new, as RRI values and concerns have seldom been applied to practical innovation and have never been explicitly applied to urban living labs' performance beyond the borders of effectiveness thinking.

AB  - An increasing trend of moving towards single-stream waste management systems is occurring in many municipalities. This is because of the ability to process greater quantities of materials, minimize material management costs, and maximize recycling convenience and participation. Research on evaluating comprehensive sustainability (economic, environmental, and social) of the two streams is very limited. This study looks to gain an in-depth understanding of two waste management systems and assist in the decision-making processes of municipalities. To achieve this, the study provides a framework for evaluating economic, environmental, and social impacts as well as a sustainability assessment of single- vs. multi-stream waste management systems within the scope of a typical North American college town. A life cycle assessment framework was employed. The scope of the assessment includes production of materials, collection, sorting, and processes included in a material recovery facility (MRF). The functional unit is 1 ton of municipal solid waste. The case study was conducted on a North American college city during its transition from multi-stream recycling to single-stream recycling. The sustainability assessment result of the case study reveals that the single-stream recycling collection cost is slightly lower (USD 86.96/ton) than the multi-stream recycling collection cost (USD 89/ton). Additionally, the GHG emissions for the single-stream recycling system (10.56 kg CO(2)eq/ton) are slightly higher than for the multi-stream recycling system (9.67 kg CO(2)eq/ton). This is due to the complexity of the processes involved in the MRF. Nevertheless, recycling rate is the determining factor for life cycle GHG emissions and costs. Municipal solid waste policymakers could benefit from this study by using the framework and study results for tactical and strategic decision-making.

AB  - BackgroundScaling up continuous quality improvement (CQI) processes could be key in achieving the 95:95:95 cascade and global HIV targets. This paper describes the experiences and outcomes related to implementing CQI processes to help reach these targets, with particular focus on clinical and programmatic settings in 6 countries from the global south.MethodsThe HIV program at the University of Maryland, Baltimore (UMB) implemented an adapted CQI model in Kenya, Tanzania, Botswana, Zambia, Nigeria and Rwanda that included the following steps: (1) analysing the problem to identify goals and objectives for improvement; (2) developing individual changes or 'change packages', (3) developing a monitoring system to measure improvements; and (4) implementing and measuring changes through continuous 'plan-do-study-act' (PDSA) cycles. We describe country-level experiences related to implementing this adaptive design, a collaborative learning and scale-up/sustainability model that addresses the 95:95:95 global HIV targets via a CQI learning network, and mechanisms for fostering communication and the sharing of ideas and results; we describe trends both before and after model implementation.ResultsOur selected country-level experiences based on implementing our CQI approach resulted in an increased partner testing acceptance rate from 21.7 to 48.2% in Rwanda, which resulted in an increase in the HIV testing yield from 2.1 to 6.3%. In Botswana, the overall linkage to treatment improved from 63 to 94%, while in Kenya, the viral load testing uptake among paediatric and adolescent patients improved from 65 to 96%, and the viral load suppression improved from 53 to 88%.ConclusionsAdopting CQI processes is a useful approach for accelerating progress towards the attainment of the global 95:95:95 HIV targets. This paper also highlights the value of institutionalizing CQI processes and building the capacity of Ministry of Health (MoH) personnel in sub-Saharan Africa for the effective quality improvement of HIV programs and subsequent sustainability efforts.

AB  - Bio-based businesses are often considered to be sustainable. However, they are also linked to sustainability challenges such as deforestation and soil erosion. Encouraged to exploit innovative solutions and enhance sustainability, organizations engaged in bio-based activities extensively explore collaboration possibilities with external partners. The objective of this paper is to integrate the available knowledge on sustainability of inter-organisational collaborations in bio-based businesses, while considering the three aspects of sustainability: environmental, economic, and social. We collected data from three academic sources-Web of Science, Scopus, and EconLit- and conducted a systematic literature review. The results show the importance of geographical proximity and complementarity in creating sustainability benefits such as reduced emissions, reduced waste, economic synergies, and socio-economic activities. Based on the findings, we have developed a framework that illustrates sustainability benefits and challenges. Interestingly, the studies emphasize sustainability benefits more in emerging than in industrialised economies, especially relating to the social aspects of sustainability. In conclusion, although the scholars have not discussed mitigation of several sustainability challenges in bio-based businesses, such as land use conflicts, they have found evidence of vital sustainability benefits, such as energy availability, lower emissions, improved socio-economic life, and poverty reduction, which are essential in emerging economies.

AB  - Businesses are increasingly interested in exploring the key concepts of industrial ecology (IE), particularly within the context of market-oriented sustainability. However, few studies have researched how green consumers perceive production as having relevant product design and life cycle assessment (LCA) dimensions. In this article, we explore green consumers' mind-set toward such system tools of IE by conducting 18 in-depth interviews with Brazilian and Portuguese green consumers. We propose a simplified theoretical framework for achieving market-oriented sustainability based on the multidisciplinary potential between IE and marketing. Our analysis suggests that there are still important gaps between what green consumers demand and what businesses are currently able (or willing) to supply. Our findings support the idea that businesses interested in following IE within the context of market-oriented sustainability should spend greater effort in understanding the green consumer's production-relatedmind-set. In particular, we propose (1) avoiding consumer skepticism and dissatisfaction with greenwashing and (2) establishing credibility and information transparency. Both seem to act as preconditions to better align the product design and LCA processes with green consumer needs within the emerging paradigm of market-oriented sustainability.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to contribute to the discussion of how large companies in the agri-food sector cope with the growing pressure to perform sustainably and how they disclose sustainability-related information to their stakeholders. To achieve this goal, we used the case study method. We analyzed Cargill's specific approach to sustainability reporting, who is a company with a 150-year history and worldwide activities. We used reports from the year 2014 and 2018. The core of our analysis lies in the content analysis of the text using 39 corporate social responsibility (CSR) keywords (Cohen, 2010). The frequency of keywords related to the three aspects of CSR was measured to reveal the areas that the company considers most important and those upon which it draws the attention of users. To complement this analysis, we then investigated the linguistic features of Cargill's sustainability reports, which employed the LIWC2015 program (LIWC-Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count) and focused on four features of disclosure (analytical thinking, clout, authenticity, and emotional tone). The findings of our research confirmed that the dominant companies in the agri-food business have reacted to challenges of their social environment and changed their attitude to keep up with the current stage of social development. Sustainability reporting is elaborated and covers all aspects of the company's activity in sufficient detail. This attitude developed continuously despite it not always being appreciated by Cargill's stakeholders. The main limitation of our study lies in the method which did not allow even with the greatest effort to eliminate subjectivity. The other limitation relates to the specific features of the company and its position within the world economy and also to its long history, which determined the form and extent of reporting. However, our findings are indicative and inspiring for future research. Our results contribute to the debate concerning the form, content, and evolution of sustainability reporting. Moreover, our results can be used in practice by corporate management, when designing their marketing strategy, plans, and programs. We claim that the biggest challenge for big multinationals like Cargill in these days is to effectively protect the nature and respect the law in jurisdictions where there is traditionally low incentive to obey the rules because of poor regulations and many opportunities to misuse their dominant position.

AB  - While there is great potential in the chief values and prospects of a circular economy, this alone will not bring the circular economy to market or scale. In order for a circular economy to materialize, an integrated approach that focuses on a long-term system change or transition is required. To set the change process in motion, many (public and private) players (companies, authorities, citizens, and research institutions) need to be involved. Among the many stakeholders, a genuine enabler to implement a successful and sustainable circular strategy is the logistics industry. Given that The Netherlands is used as a case study, in this paper, we focus on the Dutch logistics industry and how this industry can contribute to the broader Dutch agenda to realize a more circular economy. It implies looking at the specific transition agenda for the logistics industry in relation to a circular economy, what barriers may exist that might hamper such a transition, and how public policy-makers are dealing with and can tackle these barriers.

Data were collected at the beginning and end of the course. Inter-rater reliability was measured by percentage of identical coding outcomes by two coders.
   Findings - Auto-photography is effective in assessing notions of sustainability. Social and economic dimensions were captured less frequently than environmental aspects in the students' photographs. Overall, students demonstrated vague perceptual awareness about who should take responsibility concerning lifeworld-related issues. Also, their perceptions were affected by their choice of academic discipline. Engaging students in inter-/transdisciplinary learning, integrating the arts, science and community, helped develop a more balanced, action-motivated conception of sustainability. Post-test patterns of change in students' vision and action were observed.
   Practical implications - Implementing sustainability education in a university's coordinating bodies is effective in constructing a campus-based learning network, and participation in local community empowerment promotes a substantial and multidimensional concept of sustainability, and teaching material that includes content from the fine arts, literature or music stimulates students' awareness of, and sensitivity to, lifeworld issues.
   Originality/value - This paper provides an innovative, auto-photography-based methodology, including an operational procedure, coding book and method of analysis, for assessing students' conceptions of sustainability. It also develops an interdisciplinary course that serves a "threshold" intervention role in ocean sustainability education.

AB  - This article adopts a constructive approach to examining the problem of the Indo-Pacific construct. Through reflection on the east Asian experience, it proposes an analytical framework of developmental peace as a constellation of international practices, which means that the more economic development is prioritized by states in regional processes, the more likely it is that a sustainable peace will be achieved. States participating in regional integration comprise a community of practice. On the basis of a shared understanding that development is of overriding importance and underpins security and state legitimacy, the community takes economic development as the anchoring practice; this practice embodies and enacts constitutive rules and fundamental norms for a broader set of practices in regional processes, such as peaceful coexistence and non-interference. The more economic development is prioritized on domestic and regional agendas, the more likely it is that conflicts in the security realm will be relaxed or even resolved to protect security interests. The author draws some useful implications from the developmental peace in east Asia for the Indo-Pacific construct, among which the most important include building shared understandings on the prioritization of economic development, taking advantage of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, and using the code of conduct process as a vehicle and best practice to facilitate rule-making for the maritime order. Finally, the author briefly discusses the contributions of the study and limitations of the model.

AB  - The United Nations' 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) provide a pivotal framework to guide government policies and mobilize public engagement for sustainability, although further exploration is still needed to analyze the attention given to the SDGs by these stakeholders using multi-source data. To comparatively analyze government and public engagement in the SDGs, based on a case study in China, this study employed a multi-source data and content analysis to assess the perceived importance and performance of the two stakeholders. Then, this study performed an importance-performance analysis (IPA) to assess the SDGs' priority for further improvement. The results highlight the government's emphasis on SDG 7, SDG 2, and SDG 9, contrasting with public attention predominantly on SDG 8, SDG 9, and SDG 4. Regarding the performance of the SDGs in China, the greatest achievements have been exhibited for SDG 4 and SDG 1, while SDG 10, SDG 15, and SDG 17 have shown the least progress. Concerning the individual indicators, 12 out of 98 have attained 100% completion, while 19 out of 98 remain below the 50% threshold. According to the IPA results, China should concentrate on SDG 10 and SDG 15 and improve SDGs 6, 7, 14, 16, and 17 as a relatively low priority. The stakeholder analysis indicated that these SDGs are neglected zones by both the public and government. This research innovatively assessed the priorities of SDGs and could strengthen the cooperation between the government and the public to drive the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals more effectively. This study could contribute to guiding policy directions, inform strategies for public engagement, and enhance the comprehension of sustainable development in China. The framework could serve as a valuable reference for stakeholder engagement in the SDGs in other countries.

AB  - Quality problem: Many modern health systems strive for 'Triple Aim' (TA)-better health for populations, improved experience of care for patients and lower costs of the system, but note challenges in implementation. Outcomes of applying TA as a quality improvement framework (QI) have started to be realized with early lessons as to why some systems make progress while others do not.
   Initial assessment: Limited evidence is available as to how organizations create the capacity and infrastructure required to design, implement, evaluate and sustain TA systems.
   Choice of solution: To support embedding TA across Canada, the Canadian Foundation for Healthcare Improvement supported enrolment of nine Canadian teams to participate in the Institute for Healthcare Improvement's TA Improvement Community.
   Implementation: Structured support for TA design, implementation, evaluation and sustainability was addressed in a collaborative programme of webinars and action periods. Teams were coached to undertake and test small-scale improvements before attempting to scale.
   Evaluation: A summative evaluation of the Canadian cohort was undertaken to assess site progress in building TA infrastructure across various healthcare settings. The evaluation explored the process of change, experiences and challenges and strategies for continuous QI.
   Lessons learned: Delivering TA requires a sustained and coordinated effort supported by strong leadership and governance, continuous QI, engaged interdisciplinary teams and partnering within and beyond the healthcare sector.

AB  - There is rising scholarly and political interest in participatory budgets and their potential to advance urban sustainability. This article aims to contribute to this field of study through the specific lens of the city of Lisbon's experience as an internationally acknowledged leader in participatory budgeting. To this end, the article critically examines the lessons and potential contribution of the Lisbon Participatory Budget through a multimethod approach. Emerging trends and variations of citizen proposals, projects, votes, and public funding are analysed in tandem with emerging key topics that show links and trade-offs between locally embedded participation and the international discourse on urban sustainability. Our analysis reveals three interconnected findings: first, the achievements of the Lisbon Participatory Budget show the potential to counteract the dominant engineered approach to urban sustainability; second, trends and variations of the achievements depend on both citizens' voice and the significant influence of the city council through policymaking; and, third, the shift towards a thematic Green Participatory Budget in 2020 was not driven by consolidated social and political awareness on the achievements, suggesting that more could be achieved through the 2021 urban sustainability oriented Participatory Budget. We conclude recommending that this kind of analysis should be systematically carried out and disseminated within city council departments, promoting much needed internal awareness of PBs' potential as drivers of urban sustainability. We also identify further research needed into the sustainability potential of green PBs.

AB  - Waste management, one of the fundamental problems of today, is at the center of sustainability discussions. The failure to adopt a holistic and participatory approach in traditional waste management highlights the need to develop new approaches. The main purpose of this research is to present the basic components of a Web-GIS-based platform design for sustainable waste governance. The presented framework emphasizes that waste management is not a problem of local or central government and that holistic sustainable waste governance can be achieved with the participation of all relevant stakeholders. The Kadikoy district of Istanbul, a metropolitan city, was selected as the study area. Information was collected from the study area with quantitative and qualitative analysis methods. The results obtained with fieldwork and survey data show that there is a need for a location-based platform that allows relevant stakeholders to see the current waste management workflow, enter data themselves, and provide feedback. The Web-GIS-based platform proposed in this article to meet this need is an important step in ensuring sustainable waste governance. In the article, a Web-GIS-based platform has been developed to ensure the sustainable waste governance of commercial enterprises for local governments.

AB  - With the rapid popularization of digital technology, e-government has become an essential tool for modern governments to improve governance capacity and enhance public trust. Especially in the post-pandemic era, the continued use of e-government plays a crucial role in promoting public participation, enhancing government trust, and fostering sustainable governance. The purpose of this study is to explore the behavioral drivers of e-government continuance intention to use (CIU), focusing on the roles of satisfaction (SA) and trust (TR) as mediators. Guided by the Expectation Confirmation Theory (ECT), this study collected data from 393 valid questionnaires and employed quantitative analysis and structural equation modeling (SEM) to examine how perceived usefulness (PU) and expectation confirmation (EC) influence CIU through SA and TR. The findings indicate that perceived usefulness and expectation confirmation significantly and positively affect public satisfaction and trust in e-government, which in turn drive the public's intention to continue using these platforms. This study extends the application of ECT in the e-government context, providing empirical support for its theoretical framework. Additionally, the results offer practical guidance for optimizing e-government services. By improving the platform's usefulness and ability to meet user expectations, governments can enhance public satisfaction and trust, effectively encouraging continuous usage of e-government services. This contributes to the realization of modern digital governance and supports the sustainable development of society.

AB  - Participatory guarantee systems (PGS) have become increasingly important for organic quality assurance. PGS are promoted as more suitable than third-party certification (TPC) for smallholder farmers in the Global South. The advocated benefits of PGS include the promotion of organic agriculture, farmer empowerment, and the facilitation of food system sustainability. To deliver these benefits, local actor participation is key. To date, there is still an absence of in-depth studies on participation in PGS in the literature. The aim of this study was to contribute to closing this research gap by (i) conducting a meta-analysis on PGS participation and (ii) presenting a framework for studying actor participation in PGS. A systematic literature review on participation in PGS was carried out, using a framework based on Cohen and Uphoff (1980). The results showed that data on participation in PGS are still fragmented in scientific literature. Quantitative empirical evidence and data on the extent and purpose of participation and actors' perception of participation, for example, are very scarce or not available at all. This paper argues that a systematic and theory-based approach to further research on participation in PGS is needed for improved understanding and facilitation, and suggests an adapted version of Cohen and Uphoff's (1980) framework for conducting this research.

AB  - IntroductionSustainability in healthcare, particularly in medical imaging, is increasingly important as healthcare operations contribute significantly to global emissions. Radiographers, as integral members of imaging departments, play a vital role in implementing sustainable practices. This study examines radiographers' perceptions, practices, and barriers to sustainability across five countries: the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Palestine, Sudan, and Ghana, highlighting regional differences and factors influencing engagement. MethodsA cross-sectional survey was conducted among 441 radiographers using an online platform. The survey included questions on demographic information, sustainability perceptions, practices, and barriers. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and the Kruskal-Wallis H test to evaluate regional variations in sustainability engagement. ResultsResults revealed moderate sustainability knowledge among participants, with 45.1% (n = 199) understanding the concept and 46.7% (n = 206) recognizing its benefits. Common practices included digital documentation (34.6%, n = 289) and daily energy reduction efforts (32.2%, n = 142). However, advanced practices such as recycling residual contrast media or adopting energy-efficient equipment were limited. Key barriers included lack of training (39.2%, n = 173), financial constraints (44.7%, n = 197), and insufficient managerial support (39.2%, n = 173). Regional variations were evident, with Ghana showing the highest engagement across knowledge, attitudes, and practices, while Saudi Arabia scored the lowest. Statistical analysis indicated significant differences in sustainability engagement by region (p < 0.05), with Ghana benefiting from targeted educational initiatives and international collaborations. In contrast, resource limitations and insufficient institutional support hindered progress in other regions. ConclusionThe findings emphasize the need for tailored strategies to promote sustainability in radiography. Recommendations include integrating sustainability into radiography curricula, providing targeted training, enhancing leadership support, and adopting region-specific interventions. Addressing these challenges can empower radiographers to contribute to environmentally sustainable healthcare systems.

AB  - ObjectiveThis study aimed to model the long-term cost associated with expanding public health insurance coverage in Tanzania. Design, setting and participantsWe analysed the 2016 claims of 2 923 524 beneficiaries of the National Health Insurance Fund in Tanzania. The analysis focused on determining the average cost per beneficiary across 5-year age groups separated by gender, and grouped by broad health condition categories. We then modelled three different insurance coverage scenarios from 2020 to 2050 and we estimated the associated costs. Outcome measuresAverage cost per beneficiary and the projected financing requirements, projected from 2020 to 2050. ResultsThe analysis revealed that the average per beneficiary cost for insurance claims was $38.58. Among males over 75 years, the average insurance claims costs were highest, amounting to $125. The total estimated annual cost of claims in 2020 was $151 million. Under the status quo coverage scenario, total claims were projected to increase to $415 million by 2050. Increasing coverage from 7% to 50% would result in an additional financing requirement of $2.27 billion. If coverage would increase by 10% annually, reaching 56% of the population by 2050, the additional financing need would amount to $2.84 billion. ConclusionThis study highlights the critical importance of assessing the long-term financial viability of health insurance schemes aimed to cover large segments of the population in low-income countries. The findings demonstrate that even without expansion of coverage, financing requirements for insurance will more than triple by 2050. Furthermore, increasing coverage is likely to substantially escalate the cost of claims, potentially requiring significant government or external contributions to finance these additional costs. Policymakers and stakeholders should carefully evaluate the sustainability of insurance schemes to ensure adequate financial support for expanding coverage and improving healthcare access in low-income settings.

AB  - Background: There is limited research on how knowledge translation of a domestic violence (DV) research network is shared. This lack of research is problematic because of the complexity of establishing a research network, encompassing diverse disciplines, methods, and focus of study potentially impacting how knowledge translation functions.
   Aims and objectives: To address the limited research, we completed a deliberative dialogue with the following questions: Is there a consensus regarding a coherent knowledge translation framework for a domestic violence research network? What are the key actions that a domestic violence research network could take to enhance knowledge translation?
   Methods: Deliberative dialogue is a group process that blends research and practice to identify potential actions. In total, 16 participants attended three deliberative dialogue meetings. We applied a qualitative analysis to the data to identify the key actions.
   Findings: The deliberative dialogue facilitated mutual agreement regarding four key actions: (1) agreement on a knowledge translation approach; (2) active promotion of dedicated leadership within an authorising environment; (3) development of sustainable partnerships through capacity building and collaboration, particularly with DV survivors; and (4) employment of multiple strategies applying different kinds of evidence for diverse purposes and emerging populations.
   Discussion and conclusions: The use of the deliberative dialogue has uncovered specific factors required for the successful knowledge translation of domestic violence research. These factors have been added to the Integrated Knowledge Translation (IKT) capacity framework to enhance its application for domestic violence research. Future research could explore these organisational, professional and individual factors further by evaluating them in practice.

AB  - Translating policies about sustainable development as a social process and sustainability outcomes into the real world of social-ecological systems involves several challenges. Hence, research policies advocate improved innovative problem-solving capacity. One approach is transdisciplinary research that integrates research disciplines, as well as researchers and practitioners. Drawing upon 14 experiences of problem-solving, we used group modeling to map perceived barriers and bridges for researchers' and practitioners' joint knowledge production and learning towards transdisciplinary research. The analysis indicated that the transdisciplinary research process is influenced by (1) the amount of traditional disciplinary formal and informal control, (2) adaptation of project applications to fill the transdisciplinary research agenda, (3) stakeholder participation, and (4) functional team building/development based on self-reflection and experienced leadership. Focusing on implementation of green infrastructure policy as a common denominator for the delivery of ecosystem services and human well-being, we discuss how to diagnose social-ecological systems, and use knowledge production and collaborative learning as treatments.

AB  - Grain supply chains (GSCs) are crucial for global food security, economic development, and environmental sustainability. This study investigates the complexities and challenges of enhancing the resilience of GSCs. The research unravels decision-making intricacies, assesses post-harvest risks and stakeholder interactions, and identifies future research avenues. This systematic literature review (SLR), following PRISMA guidelines, and conducted with two search rounds, addressed questions of resilience and efficiency of post-harvest GSCs, key decision factors of stakeholders influencing the sustainability and operational success of GSCs, and methods that can be used to develop robust decision-making for managing risks and uncertainties in GSCs. A comprehensive database of post-2000 journal articles from the Web of Science and Scopus was analysed using bibliometric and content analysis. This research identified five key themes: (1) operational complexity requiring strategic resilience, (2) comprehensive risk management strategies, (3) critical role of transport and storage infrastructure, (4) significant impact of stakeholder decisions on GSC dynamics, and (5) diverse methodological approaches for robust analysis. These themes illustrate the multifaceted challenges and opportunities within GSCs, suggesting that integrating operations research with behavioural economics is vital for improving strategic decision-making. The results advocate for adopting advanced technologies and innovative multidisciplinary methods to improve GSC efficiency and resilience, which are essential for navigating geopolitical tensions, market fluctuations, and complex stakeholder behaviours. It identified under-researched areas such as farmer transport decisions and logistics provider selection, and integrated emerging themes (such as resilience and behavioural aspects), contributing to the body of knowledge and supporting enhanced decision-making in GSCs for a stable global food supply system.

AB  - Adopting net zero neighborhoods (NZN) combined with circular economy are increasingly recognized as an essential strategy for construction companies, allowing their transition towards sustainability and contributing to climate change mitigation. Transforming existing neighborhoods into NZN is necessary to achieve energy selfsufficiency and net zero by 2050. The success of NZN hinges on government initiatives. However, existing studies appear to lack a comprehensive exploration of the transformation initiatives within NZN, spanning aspects like raw materials, construction practices, transportation, and waste management, particularly in terms of technological advancements. To address the gap, this research introduces a conceptual framework that integrates the multiple case studies design method with an urban transformative capacity model. This innovative framework is the first application of a multi-level urban transformative capacity model in transforming existing neighborhoods into NZN within a specific region. This research specifically utilizes South Wales in the UK as a case study. It identified four key initiatives in technology, construction, transportation, and waste management. These initiatives offer significant benefits, including fostering a more sustainable and environmentally friendly construction industry through enhanced traceability and efficiency, and simultaneously promoting social sustainability by improving community engagement, providing social benefits through sharing economy initiatives, and creating new green job opportunities.

AB  - We contribute to the normative discussion on sustainability learning and provide a theoretical integrative framework intended to underlie the main components and interrelations of what learning is required for social learning to become sustainability learning. We demonstrate how this framework has been operationalized in a participatory modeling interface to support processes of natural resource integrated assessment and management. The key modeling components of our view are: structure ( S), energy and resources ( E), information and knowledge ( I), social-ecological change ( C), and the size, thresholds, and connections of different social-ecological systems. Our approach attempts to overcome many of the cultural dualisms that exist in the way social and ecological systems are perceived and affect many of the most common definitions of sustainability. Our approach also emphasizes the issue of limits within a total social-ecological system and takes a multiscale, agent-based perspective. Sustainability learning is different from social learning insofar as not all of the outcomes of social learning processes necessarily improve what we consider as essential for the long-term sustainability of social-ecological systems, namely, the co-adaptive systemic capacity of agents to anticipate and deal with the unintended, undesired, and irreversible negative effects of development. Hence, the main difference of sustainability learning from social learning is the content of what is learned and the criteria used to assess such content; these are necessarily related to increasing the capacity of agents to manage, in an integrative and organic way, the total social-ecological system of which they form a part. The concept of sustainability learning and the SEIC social-ecological framework can be useful to assess and communicate the effectiveness of multiple agents to halt or reverse the destructive trends affecting the life-support systems upon which all humans depend.

AB  - Stakeholders decisions often are based on the construction of an indicative quantity (a composite indicator), which can be obtained by an aggregation process of a series of single indicators. This aggregation process combines single indicators to one quantity, the composite indicator. In the most simple aggregation technique a weighted sum is applied. Unfortunately, stakeholders often have different opinions concerning the individual weights that should be associated with single indicators. The resulting composite indicator applied for an eventual ranking may consequently be different from stakeholder to stakeholder. The present study focuses on a partial order based methodology for evaluating stakeholders' opinions based on the food sustainability index for 2017 as an exemplary case. The paper presents the methodological background for the use of composite indicators under different weighting schemes. The food sustainability index (FSI) is composed through an aggregation of three main indicators, i.e., food loss and waste, sustainable agriculture and nutritional challenges. In the present case four fictitious 'stakeholders', represented by four different weighting schemes, expert-based, political, outcome-based and uniform are included. The study shows that differences between the four weighting schemes are present. Furthermore it is shown that within certain limits the overall ranking of 34 countries based on the FSI leads to a linear ranking of 4 specific groups of countries, virtually summarizing the different stakeholders' opinions.

AB  - Agricultural landscapes are the result of the long-term, complex, and intermingled interfaces between nature and culture. Among the stakeholders involved in the production of agri-environmental and climate services, farmers play a crucial role, and their contribution should be duly acknowledged to promote sustainable land management. Therefore, this research aims to contribute to the participatory design of agri-environmental contracts to incentivize landscape and biodiversity practices. To achieve this goal, 13 innovation labs with multi-actor perspective were established across nine different European countries. These groups envisioned a future sustainable landscape characterized by diversity and balance of economic, socio-cultural, and environmental components. Trust-based networks and effective communication channels emerge as vital components for the success of sustainable local production systems. Practitioners emphasize the significance of European-level policies in effecting transformative change and influencing farmers'willingness to contribute to both food production and environmental public goods. They defined concrete contract features such as public funding, hybrid payments, and the presence of intermediaries for the potential of agri-environmental measures. Notably, practitioners perceive a wide range of benefits associated with the implementation of agri-environmental measures, extending beyond economic compensation. Gaining a deeper understanding of practitioners' perceptions of their territories and agri-environmental measures is crucial for policymakers to design tailored and appealing programs that resonate with practitioners'needs.

AB  - Sustainable design education plays a crucial role in cultivating sustainability awareness and competencies among students studying industrial design. This research investigates their sustainability levels, reading performance when engaging with articles, and fixation patterns during reading. 60 industrial design students participated in the study. We evaluated their sustainability levels using the Sustainable Consumption Measurement Scale. After reading both theoretical and case article, they completed tests assessing their recall and perspective scores. We collected eye-tracking data to analyze fixation duration and conducted lag sequential analysis on fixation transitions. Students were categorized into higher and lower sustainability groups based on their sustainability scores. Female students demonstrated higher sustainability levels, and students with design experience performed better in the higher sustainability group. While recall scores did not differ significantly, the higher sustainability group exhibited elevated perspective scores in theory article. Perspective scores were generally higher for case article compared to theory article. The higher sustainability group exhibited longer fixation durations in theory article, while the case article had longer fixation durations on images. Fixation transition patterns varied between theoretical and case article, with the former featuring transitions from images to texts, and the latter demonstrating transitions between images. This study provides valuable insights into sustainable design education for students studying industrial design.

AB  - The central aim of this paper is to show that mathematical sciences-in particular a smart combination of modeling, numerical simulation and optimization-can be seen as a useful tool in the design of sustainable infrastructures. Thus, in the first part of this work, we clarify what we mean by systems optimization and suggest how to apply these techniques to improve sustainability. Then, in the second part, we present three interesting environmental problems-all of them involving sustainable infrastructures-that we have studied in the last decade and fit well within this framework: (a) the design of a river fishway to help migratory fish to climb a dam, (b) the design of an irrigation channel to minimize sedimentation and erosion, and (c) the management of an urban road network from an environmental perspective. Based on our experiences, we believe that this innovative use of non-trivial mathematical tools is destined to play a leading role in achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals by helping stakeholders develop the best scientifically informed strategies.

AB  - Corporate social responsibility (CSR) in supply chain management (SCM) has gained an increasing research attention in recent years. Extant studies have discussed stakeholder interests, performance evaluation, ethical sourcing, and sustainable production. The purpose of this paper is to develop a systematic study quantitatively depicting the knowledge structure and the intellectual progress of CSR for SCM. This research adopts bibliometric analysis in conjunction with network analysis to systematically evaluate the CSR-related publications for SCM. The analysis involves 628 peer-reviewed articles identified with careful selection of influential work. Data analytic techniques including citation analysis, co citation analysis and co-word analysis are used. Key findings for researchers include (1) an analytical discussion of the five sub-fields that constitute the intellectual structure of CSR for SCM; (2) Theoretical and conceptual research significantly dominate in this field; (3) The topics of sustainable development and economic and social effects are more frequently discussed among scholars; (4) Key research gaps include lacking of practical and normative modeling research, and considering from the supplier perspectives in emerging economies. The findings suggest that future research would emerge a greater depth of practical and modeling analysis to enrich the theories. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The extant sustainability literature has argued that supply chain (SC) members can gain both financial and operational benefits from a joint sustainability development (JSD) effort. However, no guidance has been provided on how SC members could collaborate on their sustainability development efforts to achieve the intended economic performance. This study addressed this research gap by proposing different contractual governances, based on a game-theoretic approach, for both manufacturer and retailer to better engage in JSD. Specifically, multiple JSD contractual arrangements regarding profit and associated cost sharing between manufacturers and retailers were defined and evaluated. Our analyses show that the manufacturer behaves opportunistically when the impact of a retailer's effort on consumer demand is low. In other words, the retailer increases its sustainability effort, but not the manufacturer. However, such opportunistic behavior can be removed under a revenue sharing arrangement. That is, the manufacturer becomes cooperative with the retailer, and both retailer and manufacturer increase their JSD efforts. Several numerical experiments were conducted to assess the effectiveness of various revenue sharing arrangements (no sharing, partial profit sharing, and total profit sharing) in devising and implementing a mutually beneficial JSD program. Accordingly, several guidelines for the SC JSD implementation are provided.

TI  - Addressing Housing-Related Social Needs Through Medicaid: Lessons From North Carolina's Healthy Opportunities Pilots Program
T2  - HEALTH AFFAIRS
LA  - English
AB  - North Carolina Medicaid's Healthy Opportunities Pilots program is the country's first comprehensive program to evaluate the impact of paying community -based organizations to provide eligible Medicaid enrollees with an array of evidence -based services to address four domains of health -related social needs, one of which is housing. Using a mixed -methods approach, we mapped the distribution of severe housing problems and then examined the design and implementation of Healthy Opportunities Pilots housing services in the three program regions. Four cross -cutting implementation and policy themes emerged: accounting for variation in housing resources and needs to address housing insecurity, defining and pricing housing services in Medicaid, engaging diverse stakeholders across sectors to facilitate successful implementation, and developing sustainable financial models for delivery. The lessons learned and actionable insights can help inform the efforts of stakeholders elsewhere, particularly other state Medicaid programs, to design and implement cross-sectoral programs that address housingrelated social needs by leveraging multiple policy -based resources. These lessons can also be useful for federal policy makers developing guidance on addressing housing -related needs in Medicaid.

AB  - STEM education's focus on interdisciplinary learning presents an ideal platform for integrating education for sustainability (EfS) in K-12 curricula. Understanding STEM educators' sustainability knowledge and their current incorporation of sustainability topics into STEM lessons is essential for further advancing EfS. To investigate these aspects, a mixed-methods study, involving both surveys and interviews, was conducted on STEM educators in Pennsylvania, United States. The results showed that most STEM educators surveyed had a simplified and incomplete understanding of sustainability, which aligns with the findings of international research. Despite the assumption that greater sustainability knowledge and perceived importance of EfS lead to teaching more about sustainability, no statistically meaningful correlation was found among these variables, indicating additional obstacles to integration. Watersheds, wetlands, and environmental experiences were identified as the least integrated topics in STEM curricula, suggesting a need for targeted efforts to enhance these areas.

AB  - This scoping review examines global strategies and enterprises for sustainable solid waste management, with a focus on alternative landfilling approaches. The study collected and analyzed a significant number of documents from different regions, revealing Asia as the major contributor (for the collected documents) (48.7%), followed by North America (24.3%) and Europe (15.8%). Recycling emerged as the most effective alternative waste treatment method, representing 52.3% of the documented approaches, with industrial recycling (22.6%) and residential/nonresidential recycling (20.2%) as prominent categories. Food waste was a significant concern across regions, constituting 21.4% of the collected documents. Composting was widely adopted (15.4%) due to its simplicity and benefits for gardening and soil improvement. Other methods like biogas extraction, reusing, raising awareness, incinerating, redistributing, reducing, and fermentation accounted for 13.1% cumulatively. The study highlights the need for adopted waste management solutions based on regional challenges and successful practices. Promoting recycling infrastructure, composting, and waste reduction approaches are crucial to achieving sustainable waste management aligned with SDGs. Collaboration and knowledge sharing between regions are essential to improve inefficient waste management mechanisms. Integrating the findings into policymaking and industry practices can lead to a more sustainable future with reduced environmental impact.

AB  - Human influences on Earth's natural systems are accelerating, with anthropogenic climate and global change posing existential risks for mankind. To overcome the policy implementation gap in practice both collective and transformative actions for sustainability involving science, policy and society are urgently needed. In the realms of science, this relates to taking inter-and transdisciplinary research approaches to foster exchange and co-designing policy options between researcher, decision-makers and other societal stakeholders; however, such collaboration is often limited by time, funding and complexity constrains.
   This paper recognises that particularly early career climate change and sustainability researchers are exposed to both the claim for and practical challenges of inter- and transdisciplinarity. For a first qualitative investigation of Austrian early career researchers' preparedness for conducting participatory research with societal stakeholders, this study examines perspectives of twelve early career researchers participating in a young scientists' workshop.
   Using a pre-post survey and analysing data by content, our findings indicate that workshop participants have to manage stakeholder processes directly after graduation and, due to a lack of methodological training, only use a small fraction of existing social science methods and participatory settings for stakeholder collaboration. To support other early career researchers and future students in Austria in developing strong inter-and transdisciplinary research skills, we highlight the added-value of integrating hands-on workshops with societal stakeholders, regular exchange of lessons learned and transdisciplinary lectures into university education. Offering more practice-oriented transdisciplinary learning activities during undergraduate education, like excursions and mini-projects in which students can develop and train participatory methods together with stakeholders under guidance, is believed to be a fruitful strategy in this context.

AB  - Climate compatibility is a cornerstone in the ecological transformation of modern society. In order to achieve sustainable development in all areas of society, numerous social actors must participate. This article examines the potential for the Catholic Church in German-speaking countries to contribute to such change. To this end, in contrast to most current studies, the Church is conceptualized as a multi-level actor instead of focusing only on the top of the hierarchy. Case studies are used to explore how various Church actors in different fields of social action evoke ecological awareness among members and non-members alike or participate in changing social structures.

AB  - Education is an important way to achieve global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), while classroom engagement and collective efficacy are key factors that influence SDG learning outcomes. However, students' in-depth thinking could be limited when they apply to search engines such as Google to support their learning of SDG-related topics. Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT show great potential to overcome the challenges. However, critical thinking is essential for the effective use of ChatGPT, and students with different levels of critical thinking may vary in classroom engagement and collective efficacy. Therefore, the study proposed the ChatGPT-AIPSS learning approach for an SDG course. A 6-week experiment was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the approach for students with different critical thinking levels. Ninety-three high school students were divided into an experimental group (learning with the ChatGPT-AIPSS approach) and a control group (learning with the Google-AIPSS approach). The results showed that learning approach and critical thinking level interacted with classroom engagement and collective efficacy. The ChatGPT-AIPSS approach significantly increased students' critical thinking tendencies, classroom engagement, and collective efficacy, and was more effective for students with high levels of critical thinking.

AB  - Real -world laboratories have become a recognised research format for addressing sustainability challenges. In these transdisciplinary settings, actors from civil society, local government, and academia work together using a transdisciplinary research approach to jointly experiment and learn about sustainability transformations. While these labs are considered to have potential, their impact has not yet been fully measured. Therefore, in our paper we explore the case of the Zukunftsstadt L & uuml;neburg 2030+ process to uncover the impacts that this long-term effort has generated over the past eight years. By examining the process and its design features from three analytical perspectives, we identify emergent impacts in three dimensions: education, governance, and the lab as an actor for sustainability. Based on our case study, we suggest that real -world labs contribute to sustainability on a local level, beyond the intentional experiments, through impacts that emerge over the course of the joint operation of the lab.

AB  - The aim of this article is to examine the effect of social relations on support for redistribution and to explore desirable forms of redistribution based on mutual understanding. Most previous studies have explained support for redistribution as insurance against risk or the pursuit of self-interest. Under the current framework, however, it is difficult to explain the establishment of a sustainable redistributive policy. To overcome this limitation, I focus on the role of social relations that suppress the tendency to pursue self-interest and promote support for redistribution. My findings indicate that social relations moderate the effect of self-interest and directly affect support for redistribution. From this result, I conclude that social relations could facilitate mutual understanding and alleviate the negative side effects of the labor market.

AB  - Learner-centered and learner-driven pedagogy have long been advocated by many educators and scholars who focus on sustainable education. This study proposes a pedagogical approach called collaborative learning by teaching (CLBT), which is both learner-centered and learner-driven. This study aims to explore and analyze the student perceptions of CLBT by conducting a field experiment in a Chinese public university. The quantitative results show that student perceptions were comprised of three dimensions: perceptions of CLBT, perceptions of teamwork, and perceptions of mobile learning. The male students had significantly more positive perceptions of CLBT and mobile learning compared to the female students. The qualitative findings indicate that although students have some difficulties with self-discipline, they gain much in active learning capabilities and teamwork skills. The relationship between CLBT and sustainability competence should be further studied in the future.

AB  - Amid increased emphasis on sustainable development, understanding the sustainability initiative and practice of companies has attracted the attention of both academia and industry. Corporate sustainability combines triple values including environmental protection, social wellbeing, and economic benefit for companies. Drawing on institutional theory and employing an inductive case research method, we examine companies developing their green innovation and sustainability projects in a challenging context of China. Four representative case studies and in-depth interviews were conducted to examine how these firms overcome barriers in the less developed institutional environment. To better explain corporate sustainability with green innovations, a conceptual framework has been proposed to illustrate how firms operate in a network of relationship and cooperate with their external stakeholders. Firms' strategies to dynamically achieve the aim of corporate sustainability were identified based on a co-evolutional mechanism in the interface between institutions and organizations.

AB  - This paper advances existing knowledge of stakeholder attitudes towards ecosystem-based forest strategies and management practices in marginalized mountain areas of the Ukrainian Carpathians. The principal research question was to analyse the state of affairs regarding multi-functional changes in upland woodlands, as viewed by relevant stakeholders. An ultimate goal was to assist decision-makers in evaluation (e.g. through stakeholder evaluation using the suggested method) and implementation (through stakeholder engagement) of sustainable policy and management decisions. The Q-method, with the sequential application of its correlation and factor analytical tools, was applied to elucidate a range of existing attitudes (e.g. towards the expansion of woodlands under climate change and other drivers) and the spectrum of sustainability (its ecological, economic and social components) to which they relate. Dominant attitudes of representatives of relevant stakeholder groups towards multi-functional changes in forestry in the Carpathian Mountains were revealed and analysed. Key factors influencing the attitudinal diversity were explained. The results improve our understanding of stakeholder priorities and of commonalities and differences in existing attitudes/perceptions, providing some indication of how the diversity of attitudes towards forestry changes (e.g. integration of woodlands in mountain landscapes) could potentially influence sustainable forestry decisions. At times, entirely opposite attitudes (e.g. of the so-called Conservationists and Productivists attitudinal groups) towards forestry practices and key objectives of forestry in the Carpathian uplands were revealed. However, people put strong emphasis on multi-functional forestry offering a range of benefits to people, the environment and the economy.

AB  - Implementation and integration of sustainable development within a management framework is the main problem of urban regeneration projects. Therefore, this paper aims to develop a sustainable heritage-led urban regeneration planning framework, which will act as an urban regeneration project life cycle model and aid sustainable planning and decision-making processes for project managers. First, a literature review is used to conceptualise the first version of the sustainable planning framework. Then, it is validated by conducting interviews with professionals in Northern Cyprus. Sustainable heritage-led urban regeneration planning problems exist in the case study region. Therefore, the data collected for this research is significant to the research problem. Results showed that there is a lack of knowledge towards heritage-led urban regeneration among the local community and it is the main source of sustainable planning problems. Therefore, a questionnaire survey is conducted to validate this problem. The results validated that there is a sustainability perception difference between the local community and professionals, and the knowledge level of the local community was not satisfactory. Finally, a knowledge management system is introduced in the final version of the framework in order to empower stakeholders, and the "eye of sustainable planning" is introduced. Perception differences between the local community and professionals and the lack of knowledge of the local community towards heritage-led urban regeneration is introduced by this research. This study is limited to heritage-led regeneration projects and future studies may extend the scope of this study to different countries.

AB  - Context Place-based transdisciplinary research involves multiple academic disciplines and non-academic actors. Long-Term Socio-Ecological Research (LTSER) platform is one concept with similar to 80 initiatives globally.Objectives As an exercise in learning through evaluation we audited (1) the siting, construction and maintenance of individual LTSER platforms, and (2) them as a distributed infrastructure for place-based transdisciplinary research with focus on the European continent.MethodsFirst, we defined a normative model for ideal performance at both platform and network levels. Second, four surveys were sent out to the 67 self-reported LTSER platforms officially listed at the end of 2016. Third, with a focus on the network level, we analyzed the spatial distribution of both long-term ecological monitoring sites within LTSER platforms, and LTSER platforms across the European continent. Fourth, narrative biographies of 18 platforms in different stages of development were analyzed.ResultsWhile the siting of LTSER platforms represented biogeographical regions well, variations in land use history and democratic governance were not well represented. Platform construction was based on 2.1 ecological monitoring sites, with 72% ecosystem and 28% social system research. Maintenance of a platform required three to five staff members, focused mostly on ecosystem research, was based mainly on national funding, and had 1-2years of future funding secured. Networking with other landscape approach concepts was common.ConclusionsIndividually, and as a network, LTSER platforms have good potential for transdisciplinary knowledge production and learning about sustainability challenges. To improve the range of variation of Pan-European social-ecological systems we encourage interfacing with other landscape approach concepts.

TI  - Meeting the Challenge of Applying an Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries Management Some Experiences and Considerations Based on the FAO's Work
T2  - TOWARDS MARINE ECOSYSTEM-BASED MANAGEMENT IN THE WIDER CARIBBEAN
LA  - English
AB  - Originally motivated by ecosystem sustainability concerns, the ecosystem approach to fisheries (EAF) has come to integrate all the elements needed for the realisation of sustainable development in fisheries, including those relevant to the ecological, socio-economic and institutional dimensions. Despite its perceived complexity, pragmatic approaches are developing such as the one adopted by the FAO guidelines (FAO 2003, 2005), and FAO is introducing and facilitating actual implementation in a number of countries and regions. While lack of detailed scientific knowledge is seen by many as the main hindrance to the realisation of EAF, preliminary observations based on the work done through FAO projects indicate that stakeholders regard poor governance and external drivers as the main threats to sustainability. In relation to knowledge needs, two opposite attitudes have emerged to address the broad range of issues and the complexity that EAF entails. One must almost dismiss the usefulness of scientific knowledge for sustainable management and instead focus on the participatory decision-making process to achieve sustainability. This attitude also recognises that scientific knowledge is often not understood and therefore not perceived as legitimate by stakeholders. The other, opposite view regards detailed scientific knowledge as a prerequisite for the EAF to succeed. The FAO's EAF guidelines, consistent with the Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries, encourage the use of the 'best available knowledge' in fisheries management, a phrase that embodies two basic principles of the EAF, i.e. seeking improved knowledge but not postponing important decisions because of lack of complete knowledge. Furthermore, given the high level of uncertainty that characterises many ecosystem issues and the increased number of fisheries management objectives, more attention should be given to risk assessment/management techniques for decision-making.

AB  - Background: The imperative for sustainable resource management has become increasingly critical in the context of a rapidly expanding global population and heightened resource demands, compounded by the pressing challenges of climate change and environmental degradation. Traditional sector-specific approaches, which frequently isolate agriculture, energy, and water management, have proven inadequate in addressing the complex interdependencies inherent in resource ecosystems. In this regard, the Food, Food Waste, Water, Energy, and Ecosystems ((FWE)2) nexus framework emerges as a transformative paradigm that advocates for an integrated understanding of these interconnected components. This framework is essential for the implementation of comprehensive strategies designed to address the multifaceted sustainability challenges confronting contemporary society. Scope and Approach: The current research undertakes a comprehensive investigation of the (FWE)2 nexus framework, elucidating the dynamic interactions among food systems, waste management, water utilization, energy production, and ecosystem integrity. Through an extensive synthesis of the current literature, illustrative case studies, and empirical analyses, multifaceted dynamics inherent to the nexus were outlined. Key themes prominently featured include the necessity of conceptualizing food waste (FW) as a critical resource, the strategic deployment of technology to enhance operational efficiency, and the integration of circular economy principles to optimize resource utilization. Collectively, these elements advocate for sustainable practices that can yield substantive benefits for society and the environment. Policy implications and key findings: The (FWE)2 nexus framework is essential for tackling the intertwined challenges of food production, FW management, water resources, energy consumption, and ecosystem health. Policymakers should prioritize collaborative efforts that unite government agencies, businesses, and communities. This synergy can create comprehensive strategies that enhance resource governance and improve global food security. Additionally, initiatives focused on public education and community engagement are vital, empowering individuals to actively participate in sustainable resource management and fostering significant societal and environmental benefits. This research demonstrates the considerable potential of the (FWE)2 nexus framework in advancing several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Optimizing agricultural practices and reducing FW directly support SDG 2 (Zero Hunger) by enhancing food security and nutrition. Furthermore, Considering FW as a valuable resource aligns with SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), promoting sustainable consumption and waste reduction through circular economy principles that facilitate nutrient recovery and renewable energy generation. Moreover, effective FW management significantly contributes to SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation) by promoting water conservation and improving water quality. The framework also underscores energy efficiency and the use of renewable energy sources in food production and waste management, thereby supporting SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy). In addition, it plays a crucial role in SDG 13 (Climate Action) by reducing greenhouse gas emissions linked to food waste and resource overconsumption.
   By aligning these strategic efforts with the broader SDG framework, the (FWE)2 nexus framework actively contributes to the global sustainability agenda, offering actionable pathways toward sustainable development that benefit current and future generations.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to analyse co-creation approach as a strategy at HE as a prerequisite for a successful implementation of sustainable development (HESD), while considering student collaboration in university processes. A questionnaire was handed in to 395 undergraduate environmental students from twelve Ecuadorian universities to test a structural equation model that included four variablesparticipation, co-creation, satisfaction, and trust. It is worth noting that these topics are increasingly relevant in competitive and innovative universities when promoting management in HESD. The results verify that student participation, as one of the key ESD skills, has a significant and positive influence on co-creation as a generator of student satisfaction and trust, especially in this context. Co-creation, from a higher education perspective, from the premise that students are the centre of the learning process, reinforces the education quality principles in an innovative way, and promotes the HESD perspectives.

AB  - Effective state regulation of the economy requires clear mechanisms for assessing investment attractiveness, a scientifically and consistent approach to identifying determinants of its improvement to achieve competitive advantages. The imbalances in a country's social, ecological, economic development decrease its investment attractiveness, the confidence level on the part of foreign stakeholders, the outflow of investment resources, the ability to achieve sustainable development goals, etc. The paper conducts a benchmarking analysis of approaches to assessing the social, ecological, economic components of the country's investment attractiveness. A method for assessing the country's investment attractiveness is developed. The paper presents the analysis of European countries during 2000-2019, which showed that Ukraine has the lowest level of investment attractiveness among the studied countries. The study results could be used in the development of mechanisms to increase investment attractiveness by identifying inhibitors and catalysts for managerial influence.

AB  - Agroecological practices are essential for sustainable agriculture, enhancing biodiversity, and soil health, and reducing chemical inputs while increasing climate resilience. This comprehensive bibliometric study (1981-2024) examines 376 publications, using co-word map analysis and network visualization to uncover clusters of research topics such as adoption, application, and sustainable agriculture. It highlights the interconnectedness of agroecology-related concepts and tracks the evolution of research interests, providing valuable insights for policymakers to inform strategic decisions. The analysis suggests that supportive policies for agroecology, driven by social movements, farmers' organizations, and academics, could include financial incentives, subsidies, and grants, as well as education and training programs. Investments in research and development, improved market access, and sustainable land management are also crucial. Implementing collaborative governance, capacity building, robust monitoring and evaluation systems, public awareness campaigns, and integrating agroecological principles into broader policies can create a conducive environment for resilient and sustainable farming systems.

AB  - Within the framework of the increasing demand to balance digital transformation and sustainable development in businesses, this study explores the impact of digital transformation (DT) on sustainable development performance (including environmental, social, and economic performance) with the synergistic effects of green human resource management (GHRM) and green supply chain management (GSCM). This study was centered on Chinese manufacturing firms and utilized partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) to examine data from 450 companies. The findings of the research suggest that GHRM and GSCM serve as partial mediators in the correlation between DT and sustainable development performance. Furthermore, the synergistic effects between GHRM and GSCM are crucial in leveraging the advantages of DT to improve overall organizational performance. These discoveries not only add to the current understanding in the field but also offer practical advice for managers.

Building on a legacy of science-policy affinity and after nearly a decade of rising policy engagement, the field is now poised to build momentum for a 'policy turn'. However, to make more rapid progress in this regard, the field would do well to consolidate its strengths and address pressing science-policy divides. Based on practical experience engaging with policymakers and taking part in the climate policy process at the federal level in Canada, this policy brief offers reflections on what these strengths are and how to improve policy resonance going forward.

AB  - Territorial problems such as the socio-ecological degradation of urban rivers represent a great challenge to achieving sustainability in cities. This issue demands collaborative efforts and the crossing of boundaries determined by actors that act from diverse spheres of knowledge and systems of practice. Based on an integrative territory notion and the boundary approach, the goal of this paper is to comprehend the boundary crossings that take place in multi-actor initiatives towards the resolution of this problem and what type of territorial transformation is produced as an outcome. Our analysis is built on participatory research on the Taquara Stream case, a degraded watercourse in a socio-ecologically vulnerable area, in southern Brazil. Our data analysis applied a visual chronological narrative and an interdisciplinary theoretical framework of analysis that combined concepts related to the territory (geography) and the boundary approach (education). We verified that local territorial issues functioned as boundary objects, fostering and facilitating dialogical interaction among involved actors, knowledge co-production, and collaborative practical actions that led to changes in the territory in terms of practices, comprehensions, and physical concrete transformations. We framed this study as one of territory-based learning meant to advance the understanding of territorial intervention processes towards urban sustainability.

AB  - The pressing need to address environmental challenges offers a significant opportunity to adopt zero-waste technologies, which can facilitate sustainable management across different levels of governance. This review focuses on recent innovative zero-waste technologies and their implementation frameworks for effective application at international, national, and state levels. The overarching concept of zero-waste involves the development of strategies aimed at eradicating waste throughout the lifecycle of products, including design, production, consumption, and disposal. The aim of this approach is not only to decrease environmental consequences but also to establish a circular economy in which resources are perpetually reused, recycled, or composted. At the global level, organizations such as the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the International Solid Waste Association (ISWA) have promoted initiatives for zero waste through worldwide frameworks and guidelines that encourage member states to adopt environmentally friendly waste management practices. These international efforts include setting ambitious targets for waste reduction, sharing best practices, and supporting the development of innovative technologies. It is crucial for national governments to translate the international guidelines into concrete policies and regulations. For instance, countries such as Japan and Germany have successfully implemented zero-waste programs through comprehensive legislative frameworks, public awareness campaigns, and the integration of advanced waste-management technologies. These national policies provide a foundation for state and local governments to develop tailored strategies to address specific regional challenges. At the state level, innovative zero-waste technologies such as advanced recycling systems, waste-to-energy solutions, and biodegradable materials are being tested and refined. States serve as laboratories for experimentation, showcasing successful models that can be scaled or adapted for broader applications. Collaborative efforts among state agencies, businesses, and communities are essential for the effective deployment of these technologies. This review emphasizes the interconnected roles of international, national, and state frameworks in advancing zero-waste technologies. It emphasizes the importance of cohesive strategies and multilevel collaboration in achieving a sustainable future, where waste is minimized, and resources are conserved for future generations.

AB  - This manuscript provides a novel approach to reputational management as a driver of entrepreneurial sustainability, using game theory to integrate three dimensions of reputation. First, if the entrepreneur perceives reputation as a risk source, the analysis is framed as a prisoner's dilemma schema that is solved by protecting against reputational threats from entrepreneurial sustainability. Second, if the entrepreneur perceives reputation as a competitive advantage, the analysis is framed as an innovator's dilemma that is solved by getting reputational opportunities from entrepreneurial sustainability. Third, if reputation is perceived as a strategic asset, the analysis is framed as a coordination game schema that results in the development of a reputational intelligence skill that has the potential to become crucial for success in entrepreneurial sustainability. Consequently, this manuscript provides an original multidisciplinary analysis of reputational management by relating well-known theoretical results from game theory to organizational realities.

AB  - Urban areas can be considered the ground for the challenges related to the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The objective of shaping cities as human settlement that will see a more inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable future is often argued in literature as an issue dependent on behavioral change of inhabitants in urban areas. In this paper, the authors question if experimental applications based on gamification can co-produce more sustainable neighborhoods through an impact evaluation method that departs from individual choices within the complex of urban mobility. This investigation is carried out within MUV (Mobility Urban Values), an EU research and innovation project, which aims to trigger more sustainable urban mobility in six pilot cities. This article describes the critical method of validation, an impact assessment of the MUV experimental gamification in the pilot cities, in order to represent a proof for future urban strategies. This methodological approach is based on an evaluation structured on indicators of both impact and process suitable for urban contexts. As based on six pilot cities, with possibilities for transferability to other contexts and scalability to other cities, the method represents a reference work for the evaluation of similar experimental applications.

AB  - Considerable debate surrounds the appropriate mix of policies to drive fishing-led development among the developing nations in the South Pacific. Since the 1970s, South Pacific small island states have committed themselves to policies of tuna industry domestication, but serious doubts have emerged as to whether these can deliver improvements to the well-being of Pacific peoples. An alternative policy approach has been suggested by development economists that would see Pacific Island nations largely abandon direct involvement in the industry and return to collective efforts to secure reasonable access fees from distant water fishing nations that take the majority of the region's tuna catches. This article argues that one reason that this policy shift has not been taken is that tuna industry domestication policies remain bound up within the influential discourse of resource nationalism. It is contended that any movement toward a more environmentally and developmentally sustainable ocean fisheries policy will require close engagement and transformation of this sovereignty-focused narrative.

AB  - The article introduces this special issue on Innovation, Entrepreneurship and Business in a Platform-Shaped Society by proposing a multilevel framework for studying digital platforms. The framework distinguishes micro, meso and macro levels and identifies five critical variables that can be analysed at each level: perspective, processes, role, value and rules. Furthermore, the paper highlights some essential challenges for digital platforms at each level, which may be relevant topics for future research. At the micro level, the technological change of digital platforms and the evolution of participants' motivation may represent exciting fields of study. At the meso level, future research could focus on issues related to the distribution of power and value among platform stakeholders and their ability to foster collaborative innovation. At the macro level, regulation, market transformation and sustainability of platform-based ecosystems are relevant topics for future research. The paper concludes with a short presentation of the articles published in the issue.

AB  - . Reflexivity is a key expectation that researchers in transdisciplinary and transformative research for sustainable development need to meet. Its aim is to enable researchers to deal with normativity, to contribute to identifying and balancing different actors' interests in processes of knowledge production, and to strengthen a pluralistic view of implicit assumptions. When designing and realizing transdisciplinary and transformative studies, researchers face a central question: How can we develop reflexive practices and live up to the demands of such work? Considering the important role that reflexivity plays in transdisciplinary approaches, it is surprising that only few approaches have explored the specific characteristics of reflexive practices empirically and analyzed how these practices are cultivated when doing transdisciplinary and transformative research. In this article we address this research gap by presenting and discussing a case in which researchers attempted to professionalize their reflexive practices at the science-policy interface (SPI). As part of the national Monitoring of Education for Sustainable Development in Germany, we used the method of collaborative autoethnography to systematically reflect on our own thinking and actions as researchers at the SPI over a period of 11 months. Based on an analysis of 66 situations in which we took field notes, we synthesized core topics of reflection and challenges encountered throughout the process (roles, relationship patterns, and normativity) in six collaborative interpretation sessions and analyzed them to understand our own practices of engagement within the field. Grounded in this analysis of our own selves as researchers looking in the mirror, we develop hypotheses about how our specific methodological approach helped us on a practical level to foster different kinds of reflexivity. With this two-fold approach, we aim to contribute to a better understanding of possible topics, challenges, and pathways of (increased) reflexivity among researchers working at the SPI.

AB  - Economic production is often accompanied by the depletion of natural resources and amplified environmental concerns. Mainstream economic models usually disregard such socio-environmental consequences of economic production. Therefore, there is more need of interdisciplinary methods to evaluate the sustainable productivity of nations. In this paper, we investigate the sustainable production growth of the 50 US states from 1997 to 2018. The US, as one of the largest economies and emitters of greenhouse gases, has a significant role to play in addressing the global environmental issues. The US has numerous national and international commitments and environmental policies in place, however the role of such policies on sustainable production has mostly been overlooked. We implement Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) models based on several economic indicators and find that most states have been efficient between 1997 and 2018. We use Slack-Based Measures (SBM) to investigate individual states' capital, labor, energy, and emission performances. According to the results, capital efficiency is high while energy and emissions efficiency is low, which results in states' eco-productivity being greater than their eco-efficiency. This highlights that, while ensuring economic efficiency, many states compromise environmental focus. We further adopt Malmquist Productivity Index (MPI) to evaluate the states' productivity, efficiency, and technological change over 22 years, and document significant adverse impact of the global financial crisis on economic efficiency. Next, we apply econometric models to evaluate the impact of renewable energy and energy efficiency policies on efficiency outcomes. The test results indicate that all policies positively affect the states' average production efficiencies and KPI measures. Overall, the findings provide valuable insights into the sustainable production growth of the US states and the impact of renewable energy and energy efficiency policies on efficiency outcomes.

AB  - The "eco-craft trail" is firmly grounded in the principles of nature-based solutions (NBS), which advocate for the preservation of ecology. It adopts a site-specific intervention approach that considers natural and cultural contexts to restore trail facilities while prioritizing the protection of the natural environment and the preservation of cultural and historical characteristics. Moreover, it aimed to engage local communities in local affairs or by convening volunteers on a working holiday. However, there has been less focus on the divergence in context-specific knowledge between local residents and outsider participants in NBS events, as well as the identified implications for rural governance. This paper aims to address these theoretical gaps by examining a case study of eco-craft trail maintenance through a participatory action process. Our study involved conducting participatory action research, including in-depth interviews with 17 participants, to explore the rural governance in Pinglin before and after eco-craft trail maintenance events. The research revealed that local residents in Pinglin demonstrate a significant level of commitment to environmental conservation and exhibit a strong sense of attachment to their local community. Within the framework of multi-stakeholder collaboration, our study found that local individuals, as opposed to outsider volunteers, display a reluctance to deviate from their established work habits. This phenomenon, referred to as tshi & uacute;-l & omacr;o in Taiwanese, embodies a collective body memory rooted in customary knowledge and physical skills unique to the local community. This paper suggests that the maintenance of eco-craft trails cannot solely rely on government resources. Instead, it necessitates comprehensive training and preparation to effectively integrate local residents with outsider volunteers in collaborative efforts. Recommendations for enhancing multi-stakeholder collaboration are essential for advancing environmental conservation, rural governance, and facilitating sustainable transformation.

AB  - Innovation in social security systems ensures economic sustainability and public well-being. In 2018, Georgia introduced a mandatory Funded Pension System (FPS) as a financial innovation aimed at enhancing pension sustainability. The success of such reforms depends on economic feasibility, public perception, awareness, and trust. This study examines the public perception and adoption of FPS in Georgia, applying a marketing and innovation management perspective to explore behavioural drivers, trust dynamics, and communication strategies affecting pension reform acceptance. Using a quantitative survey, the study identifies key determinants shaping public attitudes toward FPS participation. The findings highlight significant challenges, including low financial literacy, scepticism regarding fund security, and a preference for voluntary over mandatory enrolment. The results emphasize the role of strategic communication and public engagement in shaping consumer confidence in financial innovations. Effective marketing approaches such as personalized financial education, targeted awareness campaigns, and trust-building mechanisms are essential for overcoming resistance and fostering long-term engagement with pension reforms. Public trust in financial innovations is influenced by knowledge dissemination, transparency in financial transactions, and the effectiveness of institutional communication strategies. The study contributes to the discourse on financial innovation adoption by emphasizing the intersection of behavioural economics, financial literacy, and innovation management. It highlights how public attitudes toward financial innovations depend on clear, structured communication and transparent policies. The findings suggest that addressing behavioural and communicative aspects of pension system reforms increases public trust and engagement. These insights assist policymakers, financial institutions, and marketing strategists in designing communication frameworks that enhance trust, encourage participation, and ensure the sustainable implementation of pension system innovations in transitional economies.

AB  - How traditional industries adapt to the digital economy to achieve sustainable development has attracted scholars and practitioners. Exploring the concept of BMA (business management adaptability) can not only theoretically explain adaptive micro-operation mechanisms but can provide practical guidance for enterprises to form adaptability. To date, although a lot of effort is being spent on detecting the adaptive construction elements, refining the BMA to specific management levels, a comprehensive review combines adaptability construction elements and specific levels have not yet been formed. In this trial, this paper innovatively utilizes a hybrid method that consists of a bibiometric and structural literature review to conduct a comprehensive theoretical study of relevant literatures from 1970 to 2020. By displaying current research conclusions and their defects, this study combines adaptability construction elements and innovatively forms a multi-level BMA framework. In this framework, this paper reveals the importance of setting up performance evaluation systems that focus on corporate profitability, probing and counterpoising relations between internal and external environments. Finally, this paper provides recommendations for practitioners about how to build their own competitive advantages when the digital economy hits the global world.

AB  - Purpose People living with stroke and neurological conditions access rehabilitation at different times but self-management is often viewed as what happens post-discharge. Personalised models that integrate self-management support within everyday care are now advocated but this may require practitioners to change their behaviour to adopt and sustain new ways of working. The People1st project evaluated integration of an existing Supported Self-Management programme ("Bridges") across varied stroke and neurorehabilitation service contexts. Materials and methods Mixed-method evaluation of training for groups of healthcare practitioners across 24 UK National Health Service (NHS) Trusts, exploring how learning from Bridges was assimilated and enacted in practice, on an individual and collective basis. Results Staff growth in confidence and skill around supported self-management was demonstrated. Transformations to practice included changes to: the structure of, and language used in, patient interactions; induction/training processes to increase potential for sustainability; and sharing of successes. Bridges helped practitioners make changes that brought them closer to their professional ideals. Engaged leadership was considered important for successful integration. Conclusions Bridges was successfully integrated within a wide range of stroke and neurorehabilitation service contexts, enabled by an approach in line with practitioners' values-based motivations. Further work is required to explore sustainability and impact on service users.

AB  - This paper provides a scenic assessment of 19 dune sites using the Dune Scenery Evaluation System (DSES). The DSES assesses values from a checklist of 18 physical and 8 human parameters and allows the calculation of a scenic evaluation index (D Value), which classifies D sites into five classes: Class I, usually natural areas of top scenic characteristics, to Class V, poor scenic dune areas with a greater impact of human interventions. Our findings reveal a predominance of coastal dune systems falling into middle to lower scenic quality classes (III, IV, and V), indicating considerable degradation due to intense human activities. Notably, these activities have adversely impacted the structural integrity and scenic value of these dunes, leading to a loss of biodiversity and increased vulnerability to natural hazards. This paper highlights the critical need for integrated coastal management strategies that balance conservation with sustainable development. Furthermore, our study proposes the enhancement of existing regulatory frameworks, community engagement in conservation efforts, and the implementation of ecological restoration projects aimed at reversing the degradation and restoring the ecological and scenic value of these vital landscapes. The findings underline the potential of using scenic quality as an ecological indicator to guide conservation and management practices, ensuring the preservation of coastal dunes, which are essential for ecological sustainability and local economic benefits. This multidisciplinary approach not only enriches our understanding of the complex interactions within dune ecosystems but also sets a precedent for future research and policymaking in coastal zone management.

AB  - There is a need to deliver more environmentally and socially sustainable housing if we are to achieve a transition to a low carbon future. There are examples of innovative and sustainable housing emerging around the world which challenge the deeper structures of the existing housing regime. This paper uses the analysis of socio-technical dimensions of eco-housing presented by Smith to explore the development of an emerging sustainable housing model known as Nightingale Housing in Australia within a sustainability transitions framing. While there were several similarities to Smith's analysis (e.g., establishment of guiding principles, learning by doing), there were also some key differences, including the scaling up of sustainable housing while using tried and tested design principles, materials and technologies, and creating changes to user relations, policy, and culture. Smith's dimensions remain a good framework for understanding sustainable housing development, but they must be located within a scaling up sustainable housing agenda. What is required now is to develop a better understanding of the processes and opportunities that such housing models offer policy makers, housing researchers, and building industry stakeholders to achieve a broader scale uptake of sustainable housing both in Australia and globally.

AB  - Coastal zones experience increasing climatic and human pressures, which lead to growing risks and tipping points (TPs) under future scenarios and natural resource scarcity. To avoid crossing TPs with irreversible coastal losses, this paper proposes the development of adaptation pathways based on advanced coastal oceanography and engineering knowledge that enables a comprehensive assessment of evolving coastal risks. These pathways feature sequential interventions steered by simulations and observations as a function of available coastal resources (mainly space and sediment) and risks for infrastructure and socioeconomic assets. Such an adaptation has been developed for urban and peri-urban Mediterranean beaches, considering conventional coastal engineering together with nature-based solutions (NbS). Both types of interventions are assessed in terms of key physical variables, which serve to evaluate performance and estimate TPs. This analysis supports the new coastal protection and management plan promoted by the regional government of Catalonia and the coastal adaptation plan of the central government of Spain. The approach and results illustrate the potential of adaptation pathways for beach sustainability, enhancing the compatibility between short-/long-term coastal protection objectives under present/future climate and management scenarios. The development of adaptation pathways underpins increasing stakeholder cooperation to achieve shared decisions for coastal sustainability.

AB  - CONTEXT: Population pressure, land scarcity and encroachment of nature reserves are challenging sustainable intensification of agriculture in Uganda. One of the main staple crops in Uganda is East African Highland banana. Area expansion and improved management have enhanced the economic performance of banana, yet at the expense of food security, environmental and social sustainability. While a transition of banana-based farming systems to a more sustainable future seems necessary, the desired future state and pathways of getting there may differ among actors involved. OBJECTIVES: Our study aimed to co-design potential transition pathways with stakeholders along the banana value chain in Uganda, and to assess the effects of these pathways on sustainability indicators at the household level.METHODS: We conducted a participatory scenario analysis consisting of: 1) stakeholders envisioning and backcasting a sustainable future for two banana-based farming systems in Uganda; 2) researchers developing and quantifying plausible future scenarios to assess their effects on locally-relevant sustainability indicators at the household level; 3) stakeholders reflecting on the results, including synergies and trade-offs between sustain -ability indicators.RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Stakeholders' envisioned future combined with main trends influencing banana -based farming systems resulted in four contrasting scenarios: Marginalisation (stagnation compared with the reference baseline); Business as usual (extrapolation of historic trends); Intensification (including Integrated Soil Fertility Management and collective marketing of banana); and Transformation (irrigation in banana, balanced crop nutrient management, cooperatives, and increased farm sizes for some as other households leave agriculture).Compared with the current baseline situation, selected sustainability indicators food self-sufficiency and farm gross margins decreased in Marginalisation, but improved in all other scenarios. Soil nutrient balances were unfavourable in all scenarios, except with balanced crop nutrition in Transformation. Stakeholders recognised labour as a main trade-off for desired improvements in other sustainability domains. Stakeholders also reflected on benefits and risks of a continued specialisation in banana, and fiercely debated the desirability of mineral fertilizer use.The active involvement of stakeholders in providing the building blocks for the scenarios, identifying relevant indicators and reflecting on the results, aimed to guide stakeholders on concrete entry points for improving sustainability of the system.SIGNFICANCE: Indications of stakeholder commitment towards a more sustainable future included a conver-gence of ideas on the need for Integrated Soil Fertility Management, collaboration in cooperatives and the need for savings to overcome risks of specialising in banana. Meanwhile, higher-level advocacy and support is required in decision-making on more complex, long-term challenges.

AB  - The principal aim of environmental impact assessment (EIA) is to foster sustainable development. Sustainability can be conceived along a 'weak' and 'strong' continuum, in which the latter holds that substitution of natural capital is severely limited, and evidence suggests that weak sustainability prevails in decision-making supported by EIA. Therefore, based on the assumption that strong sustainability is the required goal to protect biodiversity and mitigate future climate change, the aim of this paper is to establish the concept of transformative effectiveness to better evaluate how EIA can foster the transformation of stakeholders' frames of references towards strong sustainability. The EIA systems of the US, EU, and Brazil were analyzed to identify the implicit and explicit drivers towards transformative change to a strong sustainability goal. A literature review of transformative change within impact assessment was used for identifying the necessary changes that need to come from both within policy actor networks and from the wider social-ecological-technological system in which EIA operates. From this, a new dimension of transactive effectiveness is characterized that can help to evaluate the extent to which EIA practice is transforming towards strong sustainability as a goal.

KW  - FRAMEWORK
AB  - In 2016, the United Nations (UN) launched the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as a framework for sustainable development and a sustainable future. However, the global challenge has been to engage, connect, and empower communities, particularly young people, to both understand and deliver the 17 SDGs. In this study, we show the benefit of a strategic planning-based experiential learning tool, the Young Persons' Plan for the Planet (YPPP) Program, to improve the underlying competencies of Australian and Mauritian adolescents in increasing understanding and delivering the SDGs. The study was conducted with 300 middle to senior high school students, in 25 schools throughout Australia and Mauritius, over an 18-month period. The intervention included the development of research, strategic planning, management, STEM (Science Technology, Engineering, Maths) and global competency skills in the students, to enable them to build and deliver regional and national SDG plans. Research methods included pre- and post-intervention testing of the attitudes of these students to sustainable development outcomes and compared these attitudes to subsets of scientists and the Australian national population. Our results, from both qualitative and quantitative evidence, demonstrate significant improvements in these adolescents' appreciation of, and attitudes towards, the SDGs and sustainable outcomes, across a range of key parameters. The results from the 76 students who attended the International Conference in Mauritius in December 2018 demonstrate significant improvements in mean levels of understanding, and attitudes of the students towards the SDGs awareness (+85%), understanding/engagement (+75%), motivation (+57%), and action orientation/empowerment (+66%). These changes were tested across a range of socio-demographic, geographic, and cultural parameters, with consistent results. These findings have significant implications for the challenge of sustainable education and achieving community engagement and action towards the SDGs in Australia and Mauritius, particularly for young people. As the intervention can be replicated and scaled, the findings also highlight the opportunity to extend both the research and this type of experiential learning intervention across both broader geographies and other generation and community segments.

AB  - Supplier selection plays a pivotal role in the mining industry, forming a key component of the supply chain management. It has been established that the integration of sustainability and resilience into this process can significantly enhance the industry's ability to withstand economic, environmental, and social shocks. Despite a large body of literature investigating supplier selection, there is a notable gap in research specifically addressing the incorporation of sustainability and resilience criteria in the mining industry. The objective of this research is to bridge this knowledge gap and contribute to the understanding of sustainable and resilient supplier selection in the mining industry. A constructive research approach was employed, identifying both practical and theoretical problems and proposing a construction-a mathematical model. This model was developed in collaboration with industry key actors, ensuring its practical applicability and validity. The main result of this research is an optimization mathematical programming model that allows practitioners to evaluate and select suppliers considering both sustainability and resilience criteria. The model facilitates a comprehensive assessment of suppliers, incorporating a wide range of factors beyond cost, including environmental impact, social responsibility, and the ability to maintain supply under various potential disruptions.

AB  - Sustainability assessment methods for building projects have a major role to play in introducing sustainability values and principles into mainstream construction practice. The paper reflects on potential measures that should advance building assessment practice in fostering sustainable construction and it advocates a redefinition of the objectives of building assessment methods. Arguably, the current emphasis in the building process and building assessment on a physical design and functional properties of buildings needs to be complemented with a concern for the quality of social and technical processes. To increase the effectiveness of any building assessment method, it is necessary to define clearly its desired outputs and outcomes. The paper suggests three significant outcomes of building sustainability assessment: integration; transparency and accessibility; and collaborative learning. These outcomes have emerged from a critical appraisal of the theory of Environmental Assessment and the Process Protocol. Environmental Assessment was examined as it provides valuable insights in terms of addressing sustainability at a project level. Lessons from the Process Protocol allow for the potential optimization of building projects using a building sustainability assessment method. Addressing these outcomes provides the means for proactive project enhancement, in terms of its sustainability and quality, by using a building sustainability assessment method.

AB  - This study was conducted to comprehensively assess artisanal fishers' economic and financial viability, relying heavily on a shared resource, namely the River Jhelum. Employing a proportional multi-stage stratified sampling approach, a total of 200 fishers were interviewed across six districts in Kashmir, covering the entire length of the river. The Benefit Cost Ratio (BCR) of 1.1, coupled with a positive Net Present Value (NPV), underscores the economic profitability of artisanal fisheries. Constraint analysis highlighted that fishermen express substantial concerns regarding the ongoing decline in both catch and the composition (Garret score: 83) of native fish species, particularly Schizothorax, and pollution in the river (Garret score: 73). Considering the perspectives of all stakeholders, it becomes evident that comprehensive sustainability measures are imperative. To achieve this, multiple stakeholders must collaborate and establish a unified administrative body, solely dedicated to the protection of riverine resources. In addition to implementing a two-month fishing ban and modifying the licensing policy, maintaining a detailed record of daily fish catches, including both biological and economic data, at each fishing site is also crucial. Such actions will facilitate the implementation of optimal exploitation levels for this invaluable inland water resource.

AB  - As more pressure is put on manufacturing companies to increase productivity and reduce waste as a means to remain competitive due to increased globalization and digitalization, many companies find themselves investing in their production systems, leading to changes in their existing factories and production systems. This process is usually performed with 2D CAD drawings and data of varying quality, leading to several challenges along the way. This longitudinal research follows up on eight years of industrial studies where researchers have applied 3D laser scanning and immersive virtual reality to improve the brownfield factory layout planning processes in real industrial scenarios, a novel approach in the research field. By interviewing key stakeholders at each company and analyzing the findings, challenges in data availability and accuracy of existing data, grasping scale and perspective, and challenges gathering input and communicating around planned changes are identified and shown to be substantially alleviated by the application of the technological tools and allowing more people to be part of the factory layout planning process. By using virtual engineering, industries can improve their brownfield factory layout planning process and take well-informed decisions leading to sustainability benefits via fewer costly mistakes, improved employee engagement, and less need for travel.</p>

AB  - Global warming, land-use change, mass tourism and a deteriorating socio-economic situation pose serious threats to the sustainability of mountain areas. The future development of these areas could be an example of the Great Transition scenario. Based on iterative and collaborative discussions with 60 treeline experts, we (1) envisioned plausible futures of treeline ecosystems in Europe and (2) explored the role of pragmatism in scenario development and use. The three global change scenario classes (Conventional Worlds, Barbarization, and Great Transitions) and four European scenarios (Economy First, Fortress Europe, Policy Rules, and Sustainability Eventually) were downscaled using the drivers-pressures-state-impact-response (DPSIR) framework. The scenarios that emerged, i.e., Global Markets, Self-sufficient Economies, Tyranny of Climate Governance, and Sustainable Use of Ecosystem Services, show that pragmatism can have either a propitious role or pernicious role in scenario analysis. Instead of being truly honest brokers, scenario producers are likely to manipulate, reconstruct, and change scientific knowledge to avoid socially and politically undesired trajectories. We showed by mathematical optimization that scenario users are likely to miss the Sustainable Use of Ecosystem Services scenario if they search within the pragmatic decision space which optimally justifies the two pre-existing global policies: climate policy and economic growth. We conclude that pernicious pragmatism leads to "the trap of the day"-a tendency of both users and producers of scenarios to use pre-existing policy agendas and scientific narratives as a pretext to promote their own objectives instead of being open to transformation in science and policy.

AB  - Community-based water supply (CBWS) is an example of how a community manages common pool resources (CPR). This results in an alternative approach to solve water supply problems in developing countries by enhancing community participation in managing water supply. This research evaluates the sustainability of five CBWS projects in Cikarang, Indonesia by using Ostrom's design principles, with additional sustainability factors found in the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) on drinking water and groundwater sustainability. Quinn et al. (2007) criteria were used in the analysis, and the results show that the management of four CBWS institutions were absent and one CBWS institution was weak. With regards to the SDG's drinking water target, the CBWS institutions were unable to comply with safe water standards, and in terms of groundwater sustainability, efforts to monitor and sustain groundwater tables were absent. Results from this research suggest that more focus must be placed on water quality and groundwater sustainability for CBWS projects.

AB  - Rapid urbanisation generates risks and opportunities for sustainable development. Urban policy and decision makers are challenged by the complexity of cities as social-ecological-technical systems. Consequently there is an increasing need for collaborative knowledge development that supports a whole-of-system view, and transformational change at multiple scales. Such holistic urban approaches are rare in practice. A co-design process involving researchers, practitioners and other stakeholders, has progressed such an approach in the Australian context, aiming to also contribute to international knowledge development and sharing. This process has generated three outputs: (1) a shared framework to support more systematic knowledge development and use, (2) identification of barriers that create a gap between stated urban goals and actual practice, and (3) identification of strategic focal areas to address this gap. Developing integrated strategies at broader urban scales is seen as the most pressing need. The knowledge framework adopts a systems perspective that incorporates the many urban trade-offs and synergies revealed by a systems view. Broader implications are drawn for policy and decision makers, for researchers and for a shared forward agenda.

AB  - IntroductionResponding to a growing need for health care professionals equipped with global expertise in local and international settings, an innovative global health medical school course was developed that combines rigorous didactics, mentorship, cross-cultural training, and international experiences to build students' cultural humility and clinical skills.MethodsRecognizing that global health service trips and courses can unintentionally exacerbate inequities and power imbalances, this course was evaluated using the four principles of Melby et al.'s Guidelines for Implementing Short-term Experiences in Global Health. These principles include skill building in cross-cultural effectiveness and cultural humility, bidirectional participatory relationships, local capacity building, and long-term sustainability.ResultsThe course was developed with long-standing global partners and includes a capstone project that is intended to strengthen local capacity with benefits to the site and student. Student course evaluations, supervisors' observations of students, and supervisor feedback forms indicate that this course achieves these principles. Furthermore, there is evidence that students developed cultural humility, acquired foundational science knowledge and relevant skills, and changed their medical practice.DiscussionThis approach could serve as a model for institutions seeking to enhance training in global health for medical students.

AB  - This paper gathers evidence from the current crisis in sustainability, which indeed has led to unsustainable global, social and human systems, to reaffirm the increasing importance of the business sector, not only in terms of its central role in the achievement of the current unsustainable path, but above all the role still to be played by business in the transition towards sustainability. Principally, this review focuses on the concept of business sustainability and calls for the necessity of collaboration between industry and academia within the context of sustainability science. To provide a reasoned and robust argument, the main co-operation modalities and best practice currently applied out of the sustainability science paradigm are reviewed. Furthermore, collaborations between industry and academia experienced within the framework of International Conferences on Sustainability Science (ICSS) are analyzed, by describing the founding principles of the innovative scientific paradigm, its evolution and its application to the field. In addition, the manuscript stresses the current relevance of the sustainability science discipline while attempting to institutionalize a collaborative and participative process, and confronts the expected outcomes with the obstacles faced. Finally, the paper proposes a series of recommendations for conducting successful business-academic collaborations within the framework of sustainability science.

AB  - It is difficult to fully match the current green development initiatives in the context of public policy and industrial economy to the new infrastructure process driven by massive data. Its connotation and extension and the level of the rule of law need to be deepened to ensure that data production, processing, circulation, elimination, and other activities can achieve high-quality and sustainable development within the collaborative construction of hard facilities and the soft environment in the new era. Based on the practical needs of data industry green development in key areas, we can resolve the legal risk of data industry green development from three aspects: improving the legal level of green public policy, clarifying the green legal benchmark of data industry development, and improving the green legal system of digital society. Then, this paper considers the design of an environmental protection system based on hardware facilities and the structural and readable clean data system innovation of the soft data industry development framework mode so as to clarify the legalization scheme of data industry green development under the new infrastructure. Overall, achieving the green development of the data industry requires not only active attempts by China but also joint efforts by China and other countries.

AB  - There is an increasing interest among practitioners to incorporate sustainability issues in evaluating the projects. However, it is a complex task to deal with the conflicting aspects of sustainable development. Nowadays, most of the minerals are produced by surface mining methods; where the economic, social and environmental impacts of these operations are closely related to Ultimate Pit Limit (UPL). UPL actuates the amount of mineable reserves, stripping ratio, location of waste dump and tailings dam, and the area of lands that will be disturbed at the end of a mining operation. Therefore, it has a significant contribution on the sustainability of the mining community. UPL determination is a strategic decision and it requires a Decision Support System (DSS) to evaluate and understand the outcome of each design alternative for optimal decision-making. In this DSS, after recognizing the indicators, it benefits from a matrix method to assess and measure the sustainability of different UPL alternatives based on subjective judgments. Moreover, some future information is unavailable and imprecise. In that regard, fuzzy logic is used to resolve uncertainties. Sungun Copper Mine data is used to show the effect of considering sustainability issues in UPL determination. The selected UPL changes net present value (NPV) and the mine life by 7% and 13 years respectively compared to the case where just economic issues are considered. The system shows to be efficient in assessing the sustainability issues of design alternatives during the feasibility studies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This article aims to present a bibliometric analysis of Smart Cities. The study analyzes the most important journals during the period between 1991 and 2019. It provides helpful insights into the document types, the distribution of countries/territories, the distribution of institutions, the authors' geographical distribution, the most active authors and their research interests or fields, the relationships between principal authors and more relevant publications, and the most cited articles. This paper also provides important information about the core and historical references and the most cited papers. The analysis used the keywords and thematic noun-phrases in the titles and abstracts of the sample papers to explore the hot research topics in the top journals (e.g., 'Smart Cities', 'Intelligent Cities', 'Sustainable Cities', 'e-Government', 'Digital Transformation', 'Knowledge-Based City', etc.). The main objective is to have a quantitative description of the published literature about Smart Cities; this description will be the basis for the development of a methodology for the diagnosis of the maturity of a Smart City. The results presented here help to define the scientific concept of Smart Cities and to measure the importance that the term has gained through the years. The study has allowed us to know the main indicators of the published literature in depth, from the date of publication of the first articles and the evolution of these indicators to the present day. From the main indicators in the literature, some were selected to be applied: The most influential journals on Smart Cities according to the general citation structure in Smart Cities, Global Impact Factor of Smart Cities, number of publications, publications on Smart Cities around the world, and their correlation.

AB  - Air pollution, which kills an estimated 7 million people every year, is one of the greatest environmental health risks of our times. Finding solutions to this threat poses challenges to practitioners and policymakers alike. Increasing awareness on the benefits of transdisciplinary research in solution-oriented sustainable development projects has led to the establishment of the research project "A Transdisciplinary Approach to Mitigate Emissions of Black Carbon" (TAME-BC). This paper introduces the TAME-BC research setup that took place with Metro Manila, Philippines, case study. The approach integrates BC measurements with technological, socio-political, and health aspects to improve the scientific state of the art, policymaking, transport sector planning, and clinical studies related to air pollution health effects. The first pillar in the setup presents an (1) air quality assessment through aerosol measurements and instrumentation, complemented by a (2) description and assessment of the current policies, technologies, and practices of the transport sector that is responsible for pollution levels in the Philippines, as well as a (3) BC exposure and associated health impacts assessment. The fourth pillar is intercrossing, fostering (4) knowledge co-creation through stakeholder involvement across scales. We argue that this transdisciplinary approach is useful for research endeavors aiming for emission mitigation in rapidly urbanizing regions beyond Metro Manila.

AB  - Social sustainability has for long been either neglected or downplayed in scientific literature and policy making and it remains an unsettled concept. The present paper critically examines several explanations for the unequal development of the social component of sustainability and suggests that social learning can serve as an insightful anchor for conceptualizing and operationalizing social sustainability. Collaborative governance is used to showcase this approach, specifically, a targeted review of multi-stakeholder schemes in natural resource management, wildlife conservation, and protected area governance. These schemes can exemplify a wide array of commonalities between the fields of social sustainability and social learning and reveal a fruitful cross-fertilization of the two concepts. The paper wishes to make two contributions. First, a specific dialectic between stakeholder collaboration and conflict under power asymmetries will be illustrated, which is characteristic in the operation of many multi-stakeholder governance schemes. Second, the need for scaffolding social learning in such schemes will be demonstrated so that a process-oriented account of social sustainability is attained. The way out offered by the present paper is that the dynamics between collaboration and conflict, properly managed by means of a toolkit with social learning templates for multi-stakeholder environmental governance schemes, may serve as a precondition for innovations sought.

AB  - Sustainability is achieved by fulfilling economic, environmental, and social goals. Until recently, social sustainability indicators had not received much attention in the literature. Social sustainability and its indicators are poorly understood, which makes it somewhat difficult to oversee the design and imple-mentation of sustainability projects. This paper responds to this by investigating Social Sustainability In-dicators (SSIs) across many sectors to learn how they could potentially apply to the energy sector, with special attention given to classifying those indicators into energy supply chains (ESCs), stakeholder, and impact levels. It does this by critical reviewing 420 social indicators in the literature and proposing a practical set of categories related to the energy sector. The findings show that the majority of SSIs ad -dress the "production" and "demand" stages of ESC. SSIs related to employees are also common, based on stakeholder analysis. The analysis highlighted the importance of internal stakeholders, in particular, in achieving social sustainability. The number of SSIs at the strategic level far exceeds those at the tac-tical and operational levels. There is no consensus on definitions of SSIs, and, subsequently, there is no agreement on their measurement or the data needed for that purpose. Potential SSIs that may conflict with one another are investigated to identify implementation challenges. The contribution of this paper is classifying the SSIs, identifying the gaps, investigating implementation challenges, discussing implica-tions, and proposing future research directions to promote awareness about renewable energy for better progress towards sustainability.(c) 2022 Institution of Chemical Engineers.

KW  - PROJECTS
AB  - Sustainable practices can only be successful when key stakeholders (e.g. client, designer, main contractor, subcontractors, etc) are in support of achieving them as shared values. The common goal of improving sustainable practices can be embedded in all aspects of projects ranging from conception to completion and in operation phase through to refurbishment and deconstruction or re/upcycling. This paper explores the various approaches that consultants adopt when 'encouraging' clients to buy into sustainable designs for large projects. Semi-structured interviews were collected from industry professionals (from Project Managers to Quantity Surveyors). Themes explored within the data included cost vs 'environmentally-conscientious' options, fundamental decisions for moving towards sustainable principles, and knowledge of long-term benefits of such choices. Furthermore, the study investigates the techniques that consultants and project teams adopt when clients are directly or indirectly against the concept of implementing such practices particularly when they believe them to be non-beneficial due to financial implications. The study sheds much-needed light on best practice methods adopted by firms operating in financially difficult environments, working to ensure green targets. It is evident from this research that everyday subcontractors need further assistance through additional measures if higher standards of sustainability are to be realised.

AB  - Sustainable phosphorus (P) management presents challenges in crop production and environmental protection; the current understanding of chemical P-fertilizer manufacturing, rock phosphate (RP) mining, P loss within supply chains, and strategies to mitigate loss is incomplete because of a fragmented understanding of P in the crop production supply chain. Therefore, we develop a knowledge-based management theoretical framework to analyze P supply chains to explore ways to mitigate China's P crisis. This framework connects upstream P industries and crop production, addressing knowledge gaps and stakeholder involvement. We demonstrate the potential to improve P use efficiency in the supply chain, thereby mitigating the P crisis using optimized P management. Our results showed that P footprint and grain production demand for RP can be reduced without yield penalty using a crop-demand-oriented P supply chain management that integrates P use in crop production, P-fertilizer manufacturing, and RP mining. Food security and P-related environment sustainability can be achieved by sharing responsibility and knowledge among stakeholders.

AB  - Vibrant rural communities are an integral component of sustainable societies due to their ability to nurture and sustain ecological and cultural diversity. Yet changing social and economic processes have led to the break-down of rural communities. This paper demonstrates how collaborative forms of governance contribute to policy learning and so rural sustainability. An analysis of a case study on rural revitalisation using the Advocacy Coalition Framework and narrative analysis reveal how common misconceptions can hinder revitalisation ef-forts. The role of a policy broker is shown to be vital in the dissolution of these policy misconceptions. Emphasis is on policy brokering strategies, particularly the use of venue creation, issue (re)framing and knowledge co -production, which resulted in changing policy believes and so policy learning. As a result of stakeholder co-alitions being inspired to reconsider their beliefs, the alignment of policy goals became possible and the effects of imbalanced power relations mitigated.

AB  - In this paper we use a form of discourse analysis to explore the 'activity' that three quite different sustainability reports set up as companies communicate their social and environmental performance. Our aim is to show what sustainability reports 'do' - in order to offer insights about what they `could do'. We show that the companies are using sustainability reporting strategically, and that sustainability is embedded in to the company's strategic priorities. Where they mostly narrate and argue a point of view, sustainability reporting can offer additional benefits by transiting towards dialogue. Dialogue provides stakeholders with the means to engage substantially with companies, and also introduce new discourses that may open up new directions in how companies contribute to sustainability.

AB  - Adapting to climate change involves taking a series of actions that reduce and/or avoid the effect of climate risks while ultimately increasing development opportunities in affected environments. Therefore, adaptation to climate change must become an integral part of a sustainable development process, in which it maintains the same priority as other development goals and strategies. Aiming to address the conceptual gap in coherent policy research in the fields of climate change and sustainable development, we performed coherence analysis research, categorized the different approaches, and defined methodology. The methodological framework was tested during the Living Lab based on a deliberative participatory process, making it easily applicable to diverse targets and contexts. The methodological framework developed in this study represents an unprecedented experience at the national (Italy) and regional level (Sardinia), projected to address global current/future environmental issues and problems through local knowledge, peculiarities, and resources.

AB  - The rise of community participation is premised on perceived benefits that participation brings to community programs in terms of added efficiency, sustainability and the collective community power. It is critical for social service professionals to gain the knowledge and skills to mobilize community members to join together and move from personal social concerns to collective concerns via organized community actions. However, the type of people who are likely to become involved in community mobilization efforts, and the motives for such participation, vary by country and culture. The purpose of this article is to present an urban community in Beijing and to identify factors that have affected community mobilization in urban China.

TI  - MERGING ADULT EDUCATION WITH NUTRITION LITERACY TO EMPOWER MEXICAN WOMEN
T2  - LITERACY AS GENDERED DISCOURSE: ENGAGING THE VOICES OF WOMEN IN GLOBAL SOCIETIES
LA  - English
AB  - Building health literacy skills is a crucial component in an adult education literacy program because of the potential to reduce health disparities and to improve health outcomes among the poor. This case study describes how a Cooperative Extension educator gleaned from adult education principles and practices to design, implement, and evaluate a nutrition education program for limited-resource, low-literacy Mexican English language learners (ELLs). Drawing from the resources of a community-based Latino coalition and the expertise of a Latino community resource agency, the extension educator offered culturally appropriate nutrition classes despite language, funding, and personnel barriers. Applying the lessons learned, she developed a sustainable peer educator train-the-trainer model that empowers community members to participate in the nutrition literacy program. She gained insights into strategies for assisting other community service educators desiring to overcome language, financial, and personnel barriers when challenged to provide community-based nutrition literacy programs for this underserved population.

AB  - Worldwide, the building sector is responsible for consuming more than 36% of the final global energy and produces 39% of carbon dioxide emissions. Accordingly, sustainable retrofit is an important method to achieve energy reduction and sustainable development. However, the lack of information on retrofit technologies and their benefits trigger stakeholder's opposition to retrofit actions. The Energy Performance Certificate tool can be used to overcome the knowledge gap and boost energy saving by strengthening its recommendation report with retrofit technologies for energy performance. Therefore, this paper attempts to determine the best retrofit technologies to be highlighted in the Energy Performance Certificate's recommendation report by considering stakeholder's opinions. For this purpose, a model based on Quality Function Deployment has been developed. The model analyzes the data regarding stakeholder's expectations when deciding to retrofit, and the potential retrofit technologies used. To validate the applicability of the proposed model, a case study was conducted in Romania. The findings are expected to contribute to improving the quality of the Energy Performance Certificate, as reflecting stakeholder's opinions combined with sustainable concepts to achieve significant energy savings.

AB  - Purpose This study aims to explore co-learning classes, a novel approach to leveraging universities' capacity to contribute to the local sustainable development agenda whilst enhancing students' learning. These participatory classes were piloted within a UK university masters' module focussed on action for sustainability. The classes sought to combine knowledge exchange, reflection and social network development by bringing together students and community stakeholders. Design/methodology/approach The classes were run as a series of five free events, each focussed on sustainability issues relevant for local practitioners. These were either regular timetabled sessions opened up to the public or additional on-campus public events. Attendance was either face-to-face or online. Evaluation was based upon participation data, written feedback and module leader's post-event reflections. Findings The classes successfully secured participation from diverse community members, including local government staff, voluntary sector workers and interested individuals. Both students and community stakeholders valued the participatory format, linkages of theoretical and practical knowledge and diversity of attendees.
   Originality/value Opening up participatory university classes for the public to attend as co-learners is a rarely used approach and has little coverage in academic literature. This small-scale study therefore has value by highlighting some of the potential impacts, strengths and limitations of this approach.

AB  - This paper focuses on the evaluation of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) investment projects from the perspective of the triple bottom line. One of the most relevant roles of CSR is the mitigation of the negative externalities generated by corporate investments, which often requires undertaking specific investment projects that fall in the scope of CSR. The main goal of these CSR projects is to improve corporate sustainability instead of maximising financial value creation. Thus, they must be evaluated for their impact on the natural, social, and financial capitals, answering these three questions: What is its efficacy for the mitigation of the externalities under consideration? What is its economic efficiency for stakeholders? What is its financial sustainability? The proposed evaluation method interlinks monetary with physical units by generating dimensionless indicators. The paper also presents a metric that unites in a single indicator the effects on the natural, social, and financial capitals. Reliable capital budgeting decisions must fit with corporate strategic planning. Since this principle also holds for CSR, the paper includes a section on the strategic planning of CSR. A numerical illustration and a case study, developed with the aid of text mining techniques, show the applicability of the findings of this paper.

AB  - Sustainability concerns have increasingly gained importance among organizations and their stakeholders around the world. In this context, eco-efficiency has become a consistent tool towards the transition to sustainable development and the efforts of eco-efficiency indicators have been used for comparative studies and decision-making tasks, providing better financial, environmental, and social performance. The aim of this paper is to provide a systematic literature review on the theme of sustainable development from the perspective of eco-efficiency, with the adaptation of the Knowledge Development Process intervention instrument - constructivist (ProKnow-C). The paper identifies and structures the state-of-the-art between Eco-Efficiency and Sustainable Development with a view to: (i) selecting a Bibliographic Portfolio (BP) that is aligned with the perception of the researchers on the theme; (ii) performing a bibliometric analysis of the selected BP; (iii) performing a thematic synthesis; (iv) finding the integration of eco-efficiency and sustainable development with other approaches; (v) proposing an innovative framework to achieve sustainable development through eco-efficiency indicators; and (vi) finding paths for further research. This research makes multiple new contributions, providing both academics and practitioners a better panorama to achieve sustainable development through eco-efficiency by expanding the literature review, highlighting the synergies and barriers between eco-efficiency and sustainable development and by comparing and analysing them, showing its relevant features. In addition, we synthesized the contributions of the BP according to the BASF indicators, sustainable dimensions and four measurement levels: industry, organization, project and process to better describe the current academic scenario on the subject.

AB  - Objective: This study explores several aspects of climate change risk on financial reporting and the provision of non-financial information in relation to climate change risk and other important information in social and governance aspects (collectively referred to as environment, social and governance (ESG). This study also extends the analysis of assurance standard use in guaranteeing ESG reporting.
   Methodology: This study utilizes professional and industry reports and research papers on issues related to the subject matter. The industry reports provide data from 2019 to 2020, and the current state of ESG reporting has been analyzed.
   Findings: Climate change risk has a significant effect on financial reporting. Auditors should consider climate change risk when performing a financial statement audit. Non-financial information, such as ESG or sustainability reporting, has been included as part of corporate reporting, given that non-financial information has been used when stakeholders make their investment or other decisions.
   Originality/Value: This study adds new knowledge by exploring the influence of climate change risk on financial reporting. Specifically, ESG frameworks, guidelines or standards are referred by companies when preparing the sustainability reporting to their stakeholders.
   Implication: This study shows that practicing sustainable reporting helps companies increase trustworthiness to stakeholders. It also highlights that more research should be conducted on issues related to current ESG practices, accounting standards and acceptance of stakeholders towards better sustainability.

AB  - This study examines the effect of oil price shocks (OPS) on the financial affairs of the oil industry and carbon releases. The study analyzes the relationships among changes in oil prices, financial variables such as stock prices, and carbon emissions. The findings indicate that OPS significantly impacts the financial affairs of the oil industry, particularly in the short term. Furthermore, the study shows that OPS impacts carbon releases in the long run, suggesting that a decrease in oil usage could lead to a decrease in carbon releases. The study contributes to the ongoing debate on the connection between energy prices and carbon releases. It provides insights that could inform policymakers and industry stakeholders in their efforts to achieve sustainability and mitigate climate change. The empirical analysis is based on a panel data set that covers 12 countries over the period 2000-2020. We use a vector error correction model (VECM) to measure the prolonged and brief-term connection amid oil prices, financial indicators of the oil industry (i.e., stock prices, dividends, and profits), and carbon emissions. The results indicate that OPS has a significant and adverse impact on the financial affairs of the oil industry, as they lead to lower stock prices, dividends, and profits. Moreover, OPS positively impacts carbon emissions, suggesting that higher oil prices incentivize oil companies to increase production and exploration activities, resulting in higher carbon emissions. These findings have important policy implications, highlighting the need for policymakers to implement measures that encourage the oil industry to transition towards cleaner and sustainable energy sources.

AB  - Increasing and competing demands on agriculture in sub-Saharan Africa mean that policy and investment decisions become more complex. Despite growing consensus on the need for sustainable agricultural intensification, there is limited agreement on how to achieve this in practice. Governments and societies face uncertainty and complex choices. This paper explores the potential of Multi-Stakeholder, Social Learning (MSL) approaches, facilitated by National Learning Alliances (NLAs), to improve policy and investment decisions. Comparative evidence from a donor-supported research and learning programme in Ethiopia, Ghana, Malawi, Tanzania and Zambia is used in a theory-based evaluation approach to assess the contribution of the NLAs to capacity and practice change amongst individuals, networks and senior decision-makers. Ten outcome cases are explored, including their contribution to systemic changes in the governance of evidence. Key lessons included: the value to decision-makers of engaging with informal networks; importance of combining dialogue, deliberation and experiential learning; the need to create safe spaces in national level MSL processes; the demanding combination of facilitation skills and commitment; and appropriately flexible support. This suggests a need not only for the production of quality research, but crucially support for MSL as a means of contributing to the good governance of evidence and sustainable change.

AB  - There is a need for scaling-up agroecology to promote sustainable agriculture at global level. Although, recent studies show that agroecological approaches can achieve both high yields and profits compared with conventional systems, the performance of other socioeconomic indicators remains unknown. This study has two objectives (i) identify the main characteristics of small-scale producers who represent the target-groups of the SDG 2; (ii) provide a comparison between push-pull and conventional farming systems of maize production to explore and possibly implement sustainable systems. In collaboration with Biovision Africa Trust, a participatory assessment framework was implemented in Western Kenya. Twenty-three farmers were selected and data were analysed showing that the push-pull contributes to social/cultural and natural/ecological capitals. In particular, push-pull farmers are more focused on socially oriented groups (75%); moreover, they cultivate smaller plots (1.9 ha) compared to conventional farmers (3.1 ha) without showing a reduction in profitability. The benefits of adopting push-pull system indicated by farmers (e.g. diminishedStrigaweed) are consistent with the advantages reported in relevant scientific literature. Considering the explorative nature of this study, the article makes a key contribution by pointing towards important questions for future research on agroecology in Sub-Saharan African countries.

AB  - Developing-developed world partnerships potentially present win-win opportunities for addressing climate-active gas emissions at lower cost whilst propelling developing nations on a lower-carbon trajectory, as carbon emissions, capture and storage are geographically independent. Expanded PES (payment for ecosystem service) principles provides a framework for assessing the transparency and efficacy of partnerships, tested on the model developed by The Converging World (TCW). The TCW partnership model currently links south-west England and Tamil Nadu, raising funds for wind turbines in India to avert emissions from conventional sources and reinvesting operating surpluses into restoration of tropical dry evergreen forest (TDEF). Over assumed 100-year progression to climax community, 123 ha of restored TDEF sequesters a conservatively calculated 270,545,880 tCO(2). This forest area is restored using operating surpluses from a 2.1 MW turbine, which generates renewable energy over 20-year operating life conservatively calculated as averting 80,000 tCO(2)e compared to a conventional energy mix. Forest restoration funded from turbine generation surpluses represents a substantial 'multiplier effect', providing around 3000 times greater overall carbon reductions. Climate regulation is one of a linked set of ecosystem services, albeit a driving 'anchor service', that may be optimised to increase overall benefits to stakeholders and contribute to UN Sustainable Development Goals.

AB  - The evaluation of sustainability is complex, involving several factors and expert opinions. In our research, we analyzed and evaluated the activities of a premium packaging material manufacturer with the participation of three relevant and professional groups. Various expectations have been defined in the form of plan values. From these plan values, we measured and evaluated the sustainability level of the company with the help of plan-fact ratios, fuzzy logic and triangular functions, enabling the subjective evaluation and integration of different opinions into the model. The purpose of our model is to support enterprise decision-making by taking into account sustainability aspects and the different expectations of interested parties. Our model helps identify intervention points and manages subjectivity in the field so that the decisions of enterprise managers better reflect the expectations and perspectives of those involved. The model we built is significantly different from previously used and developed indexes, as it functions as an enterprise-controlling model and index during sustainability evaluation. The developed model can also integrate company-specific and global sustainability indicators. Our research contributes to the development of sustainability evaluation methodology and the scientific examination of enterprise decision-making models. The controlling model we developed offers an integrated approach to managing the subjectivity of sustainability evaluation and the different expectations of stakeholder groups.

AB  - This study was conducted to comprehensively assess artisanal fishers' economic and financial viability, relying heavily on a shared resource, namely the River Jhelum. Employing a proportional multi-stage stratified sampling approach, a total of 200 fishers were interviewed across six districts in Kashmir, covering the entire length of the river. The Benefit Cost Ratio (BCR) of 1.1, coupled with a positive Net Present Value (NPV), underscores the economic profitability of artisanal fisheries. Constraint analysis highlighted that fishermen express substantial concerns regarding the ongoing decline in both catch and the composition (Garret score: 83) of native fish species, particularly Schizothorax, and pollution in the river (Garret score: 73). Considering the perspectives of all stakeholders, it becomes evident that comprehensive sustainability measures are imperative. To achieve this, multiple stakeholders must collaborate and establish a unified administrative body, solely dedicated to the protection of riverine resources. In addition to implementing a two-month fishing ban and modifying the licensing policy, maintaining a detailed record of daily fish catches, including both biological and economic data, at each fishing site is also crucial. Such actions will facilitate the implementation of optimal exploitation levels for this invaluable inland water resource.

AB  - We investigate the impact of the Problem-Based Learning (PBL) approach supplemented by student-created videos on the teaching of Probability Calculation and Inference Statistics in Business Administration and Management Studies. To that aim, we analyse survey results gathered from a sample of students from the Business Administration and Management and Law-Business Administration and Management degrees at the University of Zaragoza who participated in the PBL experience, focusing on their perceptions, skill development, dynamics of collaboration, and communication with teachers and classmates. Additionally, a comparative study of their final grades is conducted, comparing them with that obtained by students who did not engage in PBL. Our findings reveal that PBL significantly enhances students' understanding and motivation, along with their communication with teachers, particularly among repeating students, and teamwork skills, particularly among beginners. Furthermore, students participating in PBL activities tended to achieve significantly higher grades than their nonparticipating counterparts did. Moreover, our study contributes to the discourse on sustainable education by highlighting the potential of PBL as a pedagogical approach aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals. By promoting active learning, collaborative problem solving, and communication skills, PBL fosters a culture of lifelong learning and empowers students to address real-world challenges in a sustainable manner. These findings have implications for educators, policymakers, and researchers seeking to promote sustainability in higher education through effective pedagogical practices.

AB  - This chapter develops a new approach to experiential learning for sustainability and will be of interest to those seeking a baseline for the distinct conceptualizations of experiential learning and their impacts on matriculating (or matriculated) students in the longer term. College campuses are communities unto themselves and, as with communities everywhere, confront the challenges of becoming sustainable. Students attend college to learn and become knowledgeable in their chosen fields, but, perhaps with the exception of research labs, rarely have the opportunity to apply their skills to authentic or "real world" problems-experience that would allow them to become adept at both technical and cognitive process skills needed after graduation. This is especially true for projects focused on sustainability, which require multidisciplinary perspectives and interactions and thus are difficult to launch and complete. We suggest that the college campus is an ideal "living lab" that not only allows students to encounter and think about complex and wicked issues, but also to define actionable opportunities and address really-existing problems through collaborative projects that materially contribute to the sustainability of a real-world system. Pedagogy supporting "experiential learning" can play a critical role in teaching sustainability concepts and practices and thus in bolstering the Campus as a Living Lab agenda. However, we find competing or ambiguous definitions of experiential learning in the literature and no complete framework for its application in sustainability praxis. This chapter reports on research into sustainability pedagogy and assessment of the educational opportunities in experiential learning at the University of California, Santa Cruz, based on campus efforts to become a more integrated sustainable system. Accordingly, we first unpack terminology applied to "experiential learning in sustainability" from multidisciplinary and multi-departmental perspectives. This review of selected literature combined with data accumulated from students and program facilitators compares and contrasts both the historical significance and current practices of experiential learning to provide a more explicit framework for its implementation in sustainability as part of a coordinated network of distinct living lab entities. We then employ this framework to discuss a "critical gap" in college curriculum that was exposed during our investigation into the efficacy of these projects and programs at UC-Santa Cruz that may be inhibiting student preparation and their ability to contribute to the campus achieving sustainability benchmarks. Finally we propose that this lacuna can be mended by working towards a strategic integration of key experiential learning activities earlier in an undergraduate's career.

AB  - The Next-Generation Community-Based Environmental Assessment (NG-CBEA) advances a comprehensive framework by integrating key components of sustainability, public participation, follow-up and monitoring, and learning to support sustainable community development initiatives in low-income countries. This paper aims to demonstrate the application of the NG-CBEA framework to two proposed irrigation cases in Kenya, identifying key barriers and enablers that emerged from this application. Methodologically, the framework emphasized qualitative, participatory approaches, and the cases met Kenyan regulatory requirements, resulting in the approval of formal EA licenses. Key enablers identified through participant feedback included defining sustainability locally, early and ongoing participation, shared responsibility for follow-up and monitoring, and effective communication for learning. Barriers experienced in the NG-CBEA application included the time required to implement a comprehensive sustainability approach, limited access to information for meaningful public participation, absence of traditional knowledge in follow-up and monitoring, and logistical challenges for field visits to enable learning. Overall, the cases demonstrate the robustness of the framework for advancing next-generation components in CBEA and achieving more sustainable outcomes.

AB  - Introduction In response to increasing global food insecurity, resilient, circular, and sustainable practices hold significant potential to enhance food supply chain performance and reduce food loss. This study examines the current practices and key challenges faced by Peruvian smallholder farmers in managing a resilient, circular, and sustainable food supply chain, proposing a hybrid model that integrates ancestral agricultural knowledge with modern innovations.Methods Using a qualitative approach, in-depth interviews were conducted with 16 smallholder farmers from various regions of Peru. Participants were selected through purposive sampling, focusing on farmers who apply organic agricultural techniques. Data were analyzed using content analysis techniques supported by ATLAS.ti 23 software to identify patterns in practices and challenges.Results The findings reveal that farmers operate within short supply chains, without intermediaries, applying intuitive practices aligned with circular economy principles, including Rethink, Redesign, Reduce, Replace, Reuse, Repurpose, and Recycle, but excluding Recovery. While social and economic dimensions are prioritized, current practices are insufficient to ensure long-term sustainability. Key challenges include technological limitations, restricted market access, and low consumer awareness.Discussion A hybrid model is proposed, combining resource-efficient technologies with culturally rooted practices, fostering multi-stakeholder collaboration. This approach addresses identified gaps and contributes to food security, environmental sustainability, and the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals 1 (No Poverty), 2 (Zero Hunger), and 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production).

AB  - One third of the food produced for human consumption is currently lost or wasted. Insects have a high potential for converting organic waste- and by-products into food and feed for a growing human population due to symbiosis with microorganisms. These symbioses provide an untapped reservoir of functional microbiomes that can be used to improve industrial insect production but are poorly studied in most insect species. Here we review the most current understanding and challenges of valorizing organic waste- and by-products through insects and their microbiomes for food and feed, and emerging novel food technologies that can be used to investigate and manipulate host(insects)-microbiome interactions. We further construct a holistic framework, by integration of novel food technologies including holo-omics, genome editing, breeding, phage therapy, and administration of prebiotics and probiotics to investigate and manipulate host(insects)-microbiome interactions, and solutions for achieving stakeholder acceptance of novel food technologies for a sustainable food production.

AB  - Purpose - Social participation of university refers to the creation of knowledge and participatory processes with local communities in solving community problems in order to achieve sustainable development. Identifying the university's social participation strategies was the main purpose of the present study.Design/methodology/approach - In order to achieve this aim, the qualitative method was used. The study area is Semnan province and Semnan University. The statistical sample included two groups of internal beneficiaries of the university (including staff, deputies and faculty members of the university) and external beneficiaries of the university (including managers and experts of local organizations, education, province and municipality). The sampling was purposefully performed based on the theoretical saturation criterion, holding an interview with 29 participants. Data analysis was performed in three stages of open, axial and selective coding.Findings - The results of the research showed that the university can participate with its local community in developing the university vision according to the needs of the local community, holding workshops and scientific conferences, concluding joint research contracts, expert and researcher exchange, environmental leadership training, participatory management and teamwork, indigenous manpower, institutionalizing regional participation, solving community issues and problems, creating associations and non-governmental companies in the community, mission orientation, directing education and research towards solving problems and meeting the real needs of the province according to land management, supervising research activities, conducting comprehensive studies in the field of mineral potentials, organizing workshops for farmers' awareness, monitoring the employment of graduates, creating and developing new fields according to the needs of the province and region, educating citizens and cultural zing to reduce production and segregate household waste, opening the university's social space for the growth and supply of youth, educating the province's handicrafts to housewives, especially in the deprived areas, sensitizing programs in the field of environmental protection, and reviewing educational content based on the community needs.Originality/value - Biosocial and economic policy of universities was another result of the present study. The university intends to make citizens aware of social and environmental problems and to provide the necessary education in the fields of air pollution, soil salinity, drinking water supply, cultivation pattern refinement, agricultural mechanization, and waste and waste management. The university should also promote entrepreneurship among students and faculty members and attract economic resources to the university through innovation and commercialization circles, and develop the province's economic infrastructure in various fields of tourism, agriculture, industry and mining.

AB  - Cities strongly rely on efficient urban logistics to ensure their attractiveness, quality of life, and economic development. In the same time, they strive to ensure livable and safe environments around its road network, where the increased presence of light and heavy goods vehicles raises questions of regarding safety and environmental impacts. Recent literature has well-recognized the need to consider different stakeholders' perspectives on these issues, in order to achieve desired outcomes. In this paper, we introduce a collaborative stakeholders' decision-making approach for sustainable urban logistics, and demonstrate its applicability on a real-life example. The suggested approach extends existing route planning approaches by considering route sustainability as a part of an arc's traversal cost. The integration of route sustainability is based on the adoption of a multi-criterial decision-making approach, with the possibility of including different stakeholders' points of view, and evaluating the sustainability cost concerning the route's spatial context. To demonstrate the applicability of the suggested approach, we extract the route sustainability cost from the traffic sign database, and implement the findings on a real-life example. Furthermore, the suggested approach exhibits a high level of transferability to various local contexts, where local stakeholders might have a different view on the route sustainability than is the case in our example.

AB  - PurposeThis paper aims to propose and evaluate an innovative approach to education for sustainable consumption (ESC) which empowers teenagers and young adults to improve sustainable consumption competences. This approach combines pedagogical learning approaches such as real-world learning (e.g. experiential learning and research-based learning) with transformative and transdisciplinary research approaches (i.e. real-world laboratory research).Design/methodology/approachThrough a transdisciplinary research design, the authors explore if real-world experiments (RWEs) offer a suitable approach for sustainable consumption education at schools. RWEs are a research approach for knowledge production, aiming to go beyond temporary interventions, to establish semi-permanent spaces for sustainability transformation and reflexive learning. To evaluate this proposal, the authors study already existing active teaching and learning approaches developed within and for ESC and put these in perspective, to define and understand the RWEs.FindingsInsights from a transdisciplinary research project which applied RWEs as a teaching and learning approach in German schools complement conceptual considerations. As a result, advantages, such as the development of core competencies among learners, but also challenges experienced, are illustrated. Though, the challenges found are not unique to the RWE, rather they point out important potentials for ESC through suggesting systematic changes in educational institutions and teaching approaches.Originality/valueThis paper explores RWEs as an active and participatory teaching and learning approach for sustainable consumption education at schools and delivers practical insights and a definition of RWEs as an innovative teaching and learning approach.

AB  - Cities, particularly megacities, face significant challenges in transitioning toward sustainability. Many countries have developed dual or multiple capitals for diverse purposes (e.g., political, administrative, economic, touristic, and cultural). Limited research exists on the '15-minute city' (15-MC) concept, particularly in regions like Middle East and North Africa (MENA region). This study evaluates the application of the '15-MC' concept globally and regionally to derive Urban Planning Principles (UPPs) and indicators for livability and accessibility. Using a theoretical framework supported by site visits and quantitative assessments, the research examines two districts in the NAC as case studies. Key UPPs (e.g., proximity to services, mixed-use development, public transport, green spaces, community engagement, local economy, and sustainability) were evaluated along with walkability scores, bike infrastructure, and environmental impact indicators. The results reveal that most services in the two districts are accessible within a 15-minute walk or bike ride. However, essential facilities (e.g., universities and hospitals) exceed this threshold (20-30 min). The green area per inhabitant (17 m2/capita) meets WHO and European recommendations. The NAC has clean, green public transportation and 94.26 km of cycling lanes. For the sustainability indicator, air pollutants (PM10 and NO2) slightly exceed the WHO guidelines, but SO2 and Ozone levels are below the limits. The estimated waste per capita (274 kg) is lower than Cario and other counties. The findings suggest the NAC has the potential to fulfill the 15-MC concept through mixed-use developments, accessibility, and sustainable planning. This study serves for future research and modeling of the NAC when it is fully occupied.

AB  - Achieving a sustainable society requires design practitioners to eco-innovate through material selection. Material selection resources are evolving, including physical material libraries, databases, software and tools that connect materials with designers. However, the material-properties focus of these resources risks over-rationalising material selection within the context of technical material properties. Material selection needs consideration of a broader material system, reflecting sectoral behaviour, stakeholders, legislation, access to knowledge and networks. In light of this, the aim of this research is to deepen understanding of ecodesign by investigating the role of key stakeholders during material selection for the development of eco-innovative products. The research method is an in-depth case study at a sustainability-focused furniture design business. Four embedded case studies of New Product Developments (NPD) are drawn from within the main case. The case study methods include interviews, site visits and observation activities spanning three years. The case studies uncover the role of stakeholders in eco-innovative material selection during New Product Development of office furniture. The paper presents eco-innovations based on standard portfolio materials and new material adoptions. Ecodesign strategies employed include (1) Design for Disassembly (2) Dematerialisation (3) Material Streamlining and (4) Part Reduction. The results uncover how the efficacy of ecodesign decision-making is strongly dependent on stakeholder knowledge, characterised by heuristics with conflicting trade-offs along product life cycles. From this the paper presents SPICE, a new conceptual model and material portfolio classification. By linking stakeholders, material selection, ecodesign and trade-offs, the SPICE model aids strategic design management and material selection for eco-innovation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The transition towards a circular economy in the food system is posited as way to harmonize the provision safe, ample and accessible food to a growing population with the reduction the food system's widespread impact on natural resources, the environment, and human health. Within the context of circular food innovation, there is an abundance of assessment approaches allowing researchers to evaluate and guide new technologies, applications, and products. However, specialist circularity tools are underutilized. This research draws from wider circular economy discourse, sustainability assessment methods, and systems-transitions theory to propose a novel framework to appraise and guide circular food innovation. Through a systematic literature review and critical analysis, this work highlights the limitations of existing methods based on a multi-disciplinary lens. In lieu of robust circularity metrics, elaborations within the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology provide a comprehensive sustainability and circularity assessment, while cross-disciplinary approaches inform the development of technological trajectories in line with system-transitions theories. The proposed framework aims to bridge this gap by providing a holistic approach that incorporates systems perspectives and considers the wider dynamics of sustainability and circular economy via future scenario modelling. By integrating these perspectives, the framework facilitates earlier intervention and broader stakeholder engagement in the sustainability assessment process. Examined primarily within the context of food manufacturing, this work provides new tools for academic research and industrial practitioners, driving transformative change towards a more sustainable and circular food system.

AB  - The ascent of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) reporting has established itself as a global standard in financial markets, reflecting a paradigm shift toward corporate sustainability. Despite this, persistent concerns surround the quality of ESG reporting and its tangible impact on Sustainable Development (SD). To address the imperative transition toward a broader SD agenda within the ESG reporting framework, this study delves into contemporary issues and challenges associated with ESG reporting. It emphasizes the scarcity of interdisciplinary expertise across diversified fields, which is a crucial element for establishing robust reporting mechanisms capable of encompassing the multifaceted nature of sustainability. To address this, ESG reporting should extend beyond its company-centric focus, adapting traditional accounting systems to more effectively incorporate evolving ESG disclosure demands. This adjustment will facilitate a transparent portrayal of environmental and social impacts. The Social and Environmental Accounting (SEA) framework presents a structured approach to facilitate this transformation. This study underscores key SEA aspects that will shape future research, including enhancing data accuracy, standardizing sustainability metrics, evaluating the influence of ESG reporting on stakeholders, and refining disclosure formats.

AB  - This article analyses social learning in transdisciplinary research processes by a systematic comparative analysis of 20 completed or nearly completed projects in the field of sustainable development. This article considers the social learning generated by transdisciplinary processes in a broad way. It looks how social learning is embedded in the practical interaction processes between new scientific knowledge, practitioners' life-world experiences and social experimentation. The analysis finds that three factors in particular play an important role in social learning: the clarification of the normative orientations, the co-construction of the research question and practical problem situation, and the balancing of power asymmetries. While a single criterion may not allow increasing social learning alone, the analysis supports the hypothesis that a combination of these three criteria systematically increases the strength of the social learning generated. Other factors, such as active facilitation modes and the presence of collective interest advocacy organizations, only play a strong role as a condition for generating social learning in some specific types of transdisciplinary research.

AB  - Representing 9% of the land worldwide, the coastal zone is a highly populated part of the land, where economic and social growth continuously arise. An expected consequence of rapid development on the coastal zone is the creation of significant environmental pressures connected to human activities. Within this framework, the need to use the ecosystem services concept under the prism of sustainable development has risen to increase the provision of services to the people through an ecosystem approach using the human-environment interaction. The aim of this paper is to form an integrated approach for sustainable blue economy in a coastal ecosystem, using the SDGs and the ecosystem services frameworks and exploring the interlinkages of the ecosystem's parameters from both sides. The outcome of this study is the formation of a decision-making tool for sustainable blue economy in a coastal ecosystem, which classifies the SDGs with a specific factor, according to their importance for the sustainable blue economy, and helps stakeholders prioritize their actions toward the achievement of sustainability in the specific ecosystem. A case study of this approach is Elefsis Gulf, a coastal ecosystem in the eastern Mediterranean, located 18 km from the historic city of Athens, Greece.

AB  - Motivated by countries legislation and industrial practice in the field of the sustainable supply chain management, we consider a case where government requires the focal firm to implement the EPR policy, the focal firm encourages the supplier to exert effort to achieve sustainable governance. Specifically, we study the collaboration mechanisms among government's regulation, focal firm's incentive, and supplier's effort level under two governance models: (1) centralized pollution fee model (CPF) in which only focal firm pays for pollution fee to government; (2) decentralized environmental tax (DET) in which focal firm and supplier all pay for environmental tax to improve the environment sustainability. Our results show that, In CPF and DET models, government should set a high tax/fee standards when supplier faces great governance difficulty to encourage supplier to increase the technology investment. In addition, under CPF model, the benefits of supplier and social welfare can reach the optimal levels simultaneously. Additionally, under DET model, the benefit of all supply chain members can achieve the optimal levels simultaneously. Therefore, we find that DET model is better than CPF model in achieving the optimal overall performance of the supply chain, which bears the responsibilities of all related bodies. Moreover, we discuss the sensitivity of several important parameters on decision variables and profit function in the CPF and DET modes. These findings can inform environmental regulation policy and cooperation strategy of sustainable operation management.

AB  - International fisheries agreements, including the Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries (1995), have prompted co-management and Ecosystem-Based Fisheries Management (EBFM) as pathways to achieving sustainable fishing practices. These agreements suggest that participatory governance models are more likely to implement comprehensive management strategies that address the multiple interactions occurring within a fishery's social-ecological system. In Mexico, fishing committees have been established to tackle the most pressing issues in fisheries through a participatory model. However, their effectiveness in adopting EBFM remains uncertain. This analysis assesses the implementation of an EBFM approach in two distinct regions with different fisheries but highly participatory fishing committees: the Yucatan Grouper Fishery Advisory Committee and the Technical Committee for the Study of Small Pelagic Fishery. The concepts of 'good governance' and the implementation of 'ecosystem-based fishery management' were examined through semi-structured interviews with committee members and a review of internal documents. While both committees received moderate to high ratings of good governance due to their strong inclusion and representativeness, their influence on fisheries management is limited, and the implementation of an EBFM approach is partial. This limitation is attributed to institutional design flaws, weak legal frameworks, a lack of administrative capabilities, and a lack of clearly defined EBFM-oriented objectives, indicators, and goals.

AB  - Interdisciplinary scientific knowledge is necessary but not sufficient when it comes to addressing sustainable transformations, as science increasingly has to deal with normative and value-related issues. A systems perspective on coupled human-environmental systems (HES) helps to address the inherent complexities. Additionally, a thorough interaction between science and society (i.e., transdisciplinarity = TD) is necessary, as sustainable transitions are sometimes contested and can cause conflicts. In order to navigate complexities regarding the delicate interaction of scientific research with societal decisions these processes must proceed in a structured and functional way. We thus propose HES-based TD processes to provide a basis for reorganizing science in coming decades.

AB  - Chapter & deals with the sustainability theme in universities and with the main factors that have contributed to the principles and characteristics of the sustainable university (including Principles for Responsible Management Education) and the central elements of the two approaches to sustainability strategy (technical-technological and strategic-organizational). Consequently the strategic-organizational approach is investigated by analysing: governance systems and strategy, along with stakeholder engagement; performance measurement and evaluation systems, along with key performance indicators (KPI) of sustainability and the centrality of the outcome indicators in the set of KPI; and reporting systems, along with sustainability reports and the new approach of integrated reporting. Therefore, two themes are dealt with, which point out the commitment of universities: the carbon management process (along with the carbon footprint) and green universities, along with sustainability networks and rankings.

AB  - Approaches to providing sustainable energy in cities have generated considerable interest in academic and policy circles. The development of this body of work, however, has not shed much light on the modes of intermediation that are needed to reconfigure urban energy systems towards sustainability in energy-poor countries. This paper focuses on the role of academics as knowledge intermediaries who can trigger cross-sector collaborations around innovations for a sustainable energy transition in African cities. The research presented here was generated by an interdisciplinary research team made up of partners in Kenya, Uganda and South Africa. The research partners set out to better understand how sustainable energy transitions can be achieved through collaborative efforts between community members, experts and policy actors in the three countries. This paper provides evidence-based reflections on how the research partners used participatory methods to facilitate solution co-design and knowledge co-production over a period of two years under the Leading Integrated Research for Agenda 2030 in Africa (LIRA 2030) program. A key knowledge outcome of the research partnership is an improved understanding of how transdisciplinary research across the sub-region can be used to unearth the socio-spatial, cultural and political dimensions of energy in relation to other urban services such as health and housing. Based on this understanding, the paper proposes transdisciplinary co-design as a promising approach to providing sustainable energy in urban informal settlements in Sub-Saharan Africa.

AB  - This article presents the results of an academic research that aimed to verify whether the actions of the Education for a Sustainable City Program in the city of Recife have been configured as sustainable practices in a transdisciplinary logic. Regarding the methodological procedures, we opted for a qualitative research approach. Data were collected through document analysis, namely the Education for a Sustainable City Program researched on the Recife City Hall website. Data analysis was performed using the thematic -category Content Analysis technique. The results allowed us to conclude that the Educating Program for a Sustainable City brings a practical example of a transdisciplinary educational action, successfully applied, which takes into account environmental issues inserted in the local context, in a playful and creative way. It is an example that shows us that investment in a strategic program or project, with welldefined objectives, guidelines and goals that bring good results and can be replicated in other municipalities in Brazil.

AB  - To create the science we need for the ocean we want in this United Nations Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development and to support the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) value assessment, we systematically reviewed literature from the past 20 years (N = 375) that used conceptualizations of relational values in coastal and marine ecosystems of the Global South. We found four clusters of research highlighting specific characteristics. Cluster one (participatory and qualitative approaches) was defined by a focus on the relational value of cultural heritage and the production of qualitative social science data, often with a participatory approach. Cluster two (Indigenous and local ecological knowledges held by fishers and gatherers) linked to the explicit inclusion of Indigenous and local knowledges in research and to aspects of biodiversity and marine resources. Cluster three (ecological and environmental change) was determined by relational values of social relations and identity of residents and community members through the use of anthropological and ethnographic methods and linked to ecological and environmental change. Cluster four (recreation and quantitative data) was characterized by a variety of relational values, such as recreation and enjoyment, aesthetics and inspiration, or stewardship, and based on quantitative empirical social research methods mainly elicited from coastal users (such as tourists). We highlight (1) the most prevalent relational values; (2) the necessity to bridge dispersed research approaches; and (3) the possible negative impact of globalization, market pressure, and ecological degradation on relational values. Our lessons learnt are the challenge of conflating relational values with structures, institutions, or emotions; the necessity of accounting for dynamic influences on relational values; and finding ways to comparably quantify relational value categories. Our recommendations for future research are: (1) specificity regarding relational values and their object of value; (2) using transdisciplinary and participatory approaches; and (3) strengthening pro-environmental relational values for sustainability transformation.

AB  - This research aims to design effective global warming learning to build environmental awareness for young people, especially facing issues in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Learning effectiveness is measured through the collaborative skills profile. Learning was designed by considering several aspects, including previous learning, a literature study of global warming, government policies, as well as sharing and jumping tasks. The developed lesson design was tried out in grade ten of a senior high school in Bandung, Indonesia. The learning process, both audio and video, during the trial was recorded for further analysis. Audio/video were transcribed for analysis applying collaborative skills indicator. It was found that global warming learning was quite effective as indicated by the growth of 7 indicators of collaborative skills in students. Students can build dialogue, respect each other, work together, and care for each other. This research produced the lesson design of global warming that is empirically validated to inspire teachers.

AB  - Human-used and managed natural resources, such as watersheds, represent complex socio-ecological systems where learning from different knowledge sources is essential for sustainable management. Guided by the advocacy coalition framework, the paper presents a set of propositions that help explain the different functional uses of expert-based information, the network position of scientific experts, and learning within and between coalitions. Most importantly, the paper investigates common assumptions about the superiority of consensus-based institutions for integrating science into policy-making by examining two collaborative and two adversarial policy subsystems. The findings show that the scientists' centrality as coalition allies and opponents is lower in collaborative policy subsystems than in adversarial policy subsystems. The findings suggest a more hospitable setting for learning and sustainability in the management of natural resources in collaborative compared to adversarial subsystems. The paper concludes with suggestions for future research in sustainability and learning. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Although it is increasingly recognised that higher education institutions have to play a critical role in the progression towards a sustainable development, the question of what fields and issues universities should attend to in their attempt to become more sustainable remains subject to debate. In recent years, sustainability assessment tools have begun to play a prominent role in strategies to reorient higher education institutions systematically and holistically towards sustainability. In the course of their further advancement, sustainability assessment tools have not only become instrumental facilitators of change processes towards sustainability, but also established implicit normative standards by framing the overall understanding of what fields and issues a sustainable university should engage with. So far, researchers in the field have paid little attention to the understandings of a sustainable university that are underpinning and informing sustainability assessment tools. This paper addresses this gap. Based on a comparative analysis of indicators and criteria, as well as introductory passages in supporting documents of twelve sustainability assessment tools, the authors sketch the dominance and marginalisation of different fields and issues. In doing so, the paper contributes to building the capacity for a more sophisticated and reflexive engagement with different approaches to assess and evaluate sustainability in higher education institutions.

AB  - Global policies such as the recent 'Comprehensive Refugee Response Framework' call for a profound transformation in refugee response. To this end, collaboration with non-traditional humanitarian actors, particularly the private sector has been advocated. The application of new multi-stakeholder partnerships that transcend traditional dyadic relationships have been commended by practitioners for their ability to create stable services and markets in refugee camps. However, the adaptation of multi-stakeholder partnership models to the novelties of refugee response and the dynamics among partners in these complex arrangements requires more attention. This paper explores how the creation and development of multi-stakeholder partnerships can maximize the transformational potential of collaboration for refugee response, ensure the stakeholder diversity needed to provide basic services on a stable basis, and provide a facilitation function that supports the partnership. Using an action-case methodology, the focus of the article is on the Alianza Shire, Spain's first multi-stakeholder partnership for humanitarian action, which was established to provide energy to refugee camps and host communities in refugee camps in northern Ethiopia. Our findings suggest that (i) the active participation of aid agencies in the co-creation process of a multi-stakeholder partnership may increase the transformational potential of refugee response, (ii) feedback loops and the consolidation of internal learning are essential practices for the effective management of complex multi-stakeholder partnerships, and (iii) the facilitator plays a critical and underexplored role in refugee response collaborative arrangements. In addition, sustainability-oriented university centers may possess a particular capacity for nurturing the transformational potential of multi-stakeholder refugee response partnerships by generating 'safe spaces' that foster trust-building, providing a cross-sector 'translation' service, and affording the legitimacy and expert knowledge required to conduct learning processes. We believe that the theoretical and practical implications of our research may contribute to the effective fulfilment of the Sustainable Development Goals, specially, SDG7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) and SDG17 (Partnership for the Goals).

AB  - Multi-stakeholder partnerships (MSPs) are widely promoted as essential for achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, their implementation is influenced by contextual factors, including stakeholder awareness. Yet while MSPs have been extensively researched as a participatory governance mechanism, there are limited studies examining the impact of sustainability awareness and knowledge on stakeholder participation in MSPs. This study, therefore, examines the impact of sustainability awareness on stakeholder participation in MSPs in Nigeria, focusing on the issue of climate change. Through a survey of 399 MSP participants, we found high overall climate change awareness but varied perceptions of its impact. Though stakeholders were moderately aware of climate policies, awareness of its implementation at the local level was limited. Furthermore, while there was general understanding of SDG interactions, specific linkages among the goals remained unclear. These knowledge gaps could limit local level stakeholder participation and result in misalignment of MSP agenda with local priorities, thereby hindering SDG implementation at the local level. Consequently, the study recommends strengthening MSPs as knowledge-sharing platforms, enhancing sustainability literacy, and fostering MSPs that are local in design with clear link to global sustainability framework. While these recommendations offer a roadmap for enhancing stakeholder participation in MSPs for acceleration of SDGs, it is essential to acknowledge the need for a robust meta-governance framework that would facilitate sustainability awareness and knowledge at the local level for effective local level stakeholder participation in MSPs. This study contributes to the literature on the role of MSPs as central mechanisms for enhancing participation in the SDG process, particularly at the local level in the sub-Saharan African region.

AB  - Contribution: This article demonstrates and illustrates the implication of design-based learning (DBL) and plan, do, check, and act (PDCA) methodology to foster creativity, critical thinking, collaborative decision making, and communication skills (C4) with realistic constraints, theory, and practical implementation in higher education. A research model is developed to measure Society and life-long learning, environment and sustainability, leadership and collaboration, economical, communication and cooperation, thinking and problem solving, engagement, and design and development (SELECTED) aspects to measure skills of the student needed for the market-driven software industry.Background: Educators and industry experts believe that despite various efforts and collaborations, the expectation gap between academia and industry still exists while preparing engineering graduates for the market-driven software industry. For an engineering graduate, C4 skills are desirable to support the factor of SELECTED to accomplish sustainability goals.Intended Outcome: The objective is to explore the previously undiscovered relationship between C4 and program attainment factors through SELECTED knowledge access and sharing from knowledge areas of SWEBOOK as mediators to access the suitability of industry-ready graduates.Application Design: A series of experiments are conducted on students of three academic years (2017-2020) involving 180 students. The digital platform, Google Classroom, is a knowledge management platform for interaction, resource sharing, and accessing. Several evaluations through milestones identified using the C4-DBL-PDCA method are sequentially linked to the course throughout the semester.Findings: Results obtained from a series of statistical analyses show a positive and significant impact of C4 on SELECTED with acceptance for digital learning. The novelty of this research lies in discovering the relationship between these two in monitoring student activities and progress using the proposed research model and hypotheses.

AB  - The study investigates controlled environment agriculture (CEA) in Nigeria focusing on its feasibility, economic benefits, environmental impact, and socio-economic implications. While CEA technologies such as hydroponics, vertical farming, automation, and greenhouse systems offer efficiency and yield improvements, this review highlights the extent to which they can be utilized in solving the food challenges facing the country including food shortages, wasteful use of land, and climatic disturbances in agriculture. However, their adoption faces challenges like high initial costs, technical knowledge gaps, and unstable energy infrastructure. Additionally, there is a lack of localized research on resource utilization, crop profitability, and the scalability of these systems in Nigeria's urban and rural contexts, which further hinders adoption. Government policy reforms, renewable energy access, and capacity-building programs are crucial to overcoming these barriers. Localized pilot projects and field studies are also necessary to validate the feasibility of CEA systems under Nigeria's unique socio-economic and climatic conditions. Cross-country comparisons with South Africa and Kenya reveal actionable insights for Nigeria's CEA implementation such as South Africa's public-private partnerships and Kenya's solar-powered vertical farms which can serve as actionable blueprints for Nigeria's CEA adoption and expansion. Nigeria with its teeming population is food import-dependent, with agricultural imports reaching 3.35 trillion Naira between 2019 and 2023. This is unsustainable and requires alternative measures including targeted CEA interventions to increase its agricultural productivity. Overall, for CEA to contribute meaningfully to the Nigerian agricultural sector, specific changes including targeted subsidies, policy reforms, renewable energy access, stakeholder engagement, capacity-building programs, and infrastructure development must be instituted to achieve sustainable agricultural growth. Furthermore, strategies such as hybridizing traditional and CEA practices and creating "pay-as-you-grow" financial models for CEA infrastructure can make the transition more viable for smallholder farmers, who dominate Nigeria's agricultural sector.

AB  - What makes knowledge relevant to environmental sustainability actionable, and how can its societal impacts be evaluated? Scholars and practitioners have increasingly advocated that the traditional linear model of knowledge production, with its unidirectional flow of information from researchers to policy-makers, bereplacedbyanewapproachinwhichresearchersand knowledge-users meaningfully interact to co-create knowledge that is actionable in decision-making. This popular model - co-production - has advanced thinking on how to create usable knowledge. In practice, however, co-production has not been a single approach, but instead a diversity of forms of engaged research. Further, the jargon may both obfuscate governance dimensions and limit understanding of what works. Improved distinction among the different ways researchers and societal partners interact can enable attentive and effective engagement across contexts. Recognition of this diversity is necessary in advancing the processes and impacts of actionable knowledge for sustainability.

AB  - Sustainability reports are tools for disseminating information to stakeholders and the public, serving the organizations in the dual purpose of communicating CSR and being accountable. The production of these reports has recently become more prevalent in the food industry, despite the fact this practice has received heavy criticism on two fronts: The quality of the tool for communication, and the extent of accountability. In addition to these criticisms, organizations must overcome the additional challenge of publishing sustainability reports that successfully meet the demands of a multi-stakeholder audience. In light of the importance of this practice, this paper presents a method to assess the communication and accountability characteristics of Spanish food companies' sustainability reports. This method is based on the method Analytic Network Process (ANP) and adopts a multi-stakeholder approach. This research, therefore, provides a reference model for improving sustainability reports, with the aim of successfully meeting their communication objectives and the demands of all stakeholders.

AB  - Ethiopia is a lucky and nature-gifted country that is endowed with an outstanding, diverse, and the product of different ethnic group assets of heritages. These heritages are the manifestation of those societies' cultural identity and national pride. Both tangible and intangible heritages are the main assets to drive visitors to those destinations and attractions. Based on tourism, the country can achieve sustainable cultural tourism with sustainable socio-economic development. Therefore, heritage resources are the key to achieving sustainable cultural tourism where this paper tried to assess Ethiopian Cultural heritage resources as a driver of Cultural tourism development by stating their qualities. To attain the set goal, the study implements a qualitative research approach and uses content analyses to analyze literature from journals, thesis, and books on heritage studies that are taken from Academia, Google Scholar, Science direct, and Research gate. The scope of the study revolved around only eight tangible cultural heritages of the country which are enlisted in UNESCO as a world heritage sites. The reviewed literature revealed that the cultural heritages of Ethiopia contributed to the development of sustainable cultural tourism but it did not achieve the expected result because of different factors. The author recommended that the stakeholders must create a sustainable tourism policy to achieve sustainable cultural tourism in the country.

AB  - In recent years, a profusion of methods, practices, and experiences has emerged in the interface between arts and sustainability science. Drawing from two strong currents within sustainability science, namely, the emphasis on transdisciplinary approaches and the need to move towards societal transformations, such hybrid approaches seemingly contribute with unique methods to sustainability research. Despite repeated claims from sustainability scientists about art's role in sustainability transformations, joint analyses with artists and practitioners are still rare. We conveyed a collaborative and exploratory workshop with scientists, artists, and practitioners from the fields of education, public engagement, and activism to identify the potentials for arts-based sustainability research. Participants were invited to facilitate and trial various artistic practices from disciplines of performative, literary, narrative, audio-visual and plastic arts. In this paper, we present five key areas identified in the workshop, where arts-based methods can significantly contribute to sustainability research: embracing more-than-cognitive aspects of knowledge, improving communication, grappling with power dynamics, shifting relationships to nature, and facilitating futures visioning. Workshop participants also identified challenges related to power dynamics, tensions across paradigms, and implementation conditions, providing insights into how to leverage arts' potential to respond to global environmental challenges while boosting societal transformations. We then discuss research questions identified that address challenges and limitations for arts-based research in sustainability.

AB  - This article aims to explore factors that influence organizational learning around sustainability. For our theoretical framework, we take a sensemaking approach to the multilevel 4I model of organizational learning. Through our pilot study of the case of the higher education sector in Australia, we explore the particular challenges that sustainability poses in terms of integrating new ideas at the group and organizational levels. Our findings suggest that the use of knowledge sharing and generation tools in the form of selected boundary objects can promote the development of communities of practice and hence those integration and institutionalization processes described by the 4I framework when it is applied to sustainability. In specifically allowing for knowledge development and transfer across knowledge and disciplinary boundaries, our revised version of the 4I model has wide relevance to learning around sustainability in any organizational context.

AB  - Engaging citizens is crucial in disaster recovery efforts, yet its actualization remains elusive. Communities often find themselves relegated to passive recipients, leading to suboptimal reconstruction projects. The primary objective of this study was to explore the community's perspective regarding optimal processes and outcomes requisite for their meaningful participation, aligning these insights with community development principles. Utilizing qualitative research methodologies such as face-to-face interviews, observations, focus group discussions, and questionnaire surveys the study identified key processes, including equitable stakeholder representation, empowerment in decision-making, integration of indigenous knowledge, early community engagement, and capacity enhancement. These processses are pivital for achieving sustainable development outcomes such as project ownership and successful attainment of project objectives. This research provides critical insights into engaging residents in post-disaster recovery and reconstruction efforts emphasizing the integral role of community development in facilitating inclusive and effective recovery and ensuring projects meet community needs and expectations.

AB  - In recent years, numerous examples of food system dashboards have been developed with the goal of offering users the opportunity to monitor or assess (their) national food systems. One of the many challenges faced by these initiatives has been to strike an acceptable balance between the complexity, local-specificity, and multi-sectoral nature of these food systems while also ensuring that the information remains accessible and usable for decision-makers. Perhaps even more critical, yet rarely discussed or implemented in most of the current food system dashboard initiatives, is the imperative of co-constructing these initiatives with local stakeholders. The case presented in this study puts participation at the center of the design and construction of a food systems' monitoring dashboard. Using a replicable yet rigorous methodology, we demonstrate the feasibility of co-creating food system dashboards that integrate comprehensive and multi-sectoral inputs from national stakeholders while ensuring these dashboards are functional, evidence-based, and reflective of the country's specific features. The approach is illustrated with the empirical cases of three pilot countries within the low-and middle-income countries group (Bangladesh, Ethiopia, and Honduras), where the methodology was tested between 2021 and 2022. We conclude by succinctly examining the ongoing challenges in constructing actionable food system dashboards.

AB  - While innovation is essential for sustainable development, micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs), which account for more than 90% of firms in Latin America, face the challenge of benefiting systematically from innovation due to capability and negotiation asymmetries when compared with large organizations. In this context, open innovation holds promise to enable shared-value creation in terms of developing MSME capabilities, operations, and the organization of activities, especially when mediated and supported by public sector actors. It may also hold promise for the development of MSMEs when there is a lack of well-developed ecosystems with multiple central actors, as is the case in many less-developed Latin American countries, such as Nicaragua. Open innovation ecosystems support platforms that form the delivery vehicles for the offerings of firms, providing a framework of processes, rules, and policies for the purpose of co-creating value. These platforms also offer a development gateway for the participating MSMEs, impacting the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) created by The United Nations. Despite the potential for open innovation and its application in entrepreneurship ecosystems, few cases document the essential elements for designing these supporting platforms. In this case study, we aim to provide a framework for mediated, shared-value open innovation platforms by applying design science and case study approaches. Our work contributes to the field of knowledge-based ecosystems and open innovation platforms and considers best practices that can be applied in similar contexts.

AB  - Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) regulate human behaviour within their boundaries to support long-term conservation of marine ecosystems and associated human benefits. As complex socio-ecological systems, the success of MPAs is fundamentally reliant upon community and stakeholder engagement, support, and compliance. Using the Aliwal Shoal MPA in South Africa as a case study, 48 stakeholder interviews were conducted to explore perceptions of existing challenges and potential solutions relating to management of the MPA. Analysis identified several challenges including: i) non-compliance with existing laws; ii) insufficient marine law enforcement; iii) national corruption; iv) poor physical infrastructure, and v) perceived racially biased MPA regulations. To address these challenges, interviewees highlighted the following potential solutions: i) development of awareness raising initiatives to foster marine stewardship and support for the MPA; ii) improving the visibility of marine conservation and MPA management activities; iii) investing finances generated by the Aliwal Shoal MPA regulations (such as diving permit fees) directly into MPA management; iv) identifying and enhancing local skills and knowledge that could contribute to enhancing conservation activities; and v) exploring innovative technical solutions that can improve community awareness and compliance with MPA regulations. While not representative of the entire spectrum of stakeholders, this paper provides useful insights that can be used by national MPA implementing agencies, local management bodies and conservation organisations as they try to improve engagement with local stakeholders to optimise social, economic, and ecological benefits, and contribute to improved governance. Additionally, the paper contributes to the global call for improved communication and engagement with stakeholders about MPAs, especially considering the increased emphasis placed on protected areas for global conservation.

AB  - The theoretical framework of ecosystem services and that of resilience thinking are combined in an empirical case study of a social-ecological system. In the River Helge a catchment in southern Sweden, a slow increase in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) results in brownification of the water with consequences on ecosystem services in the lower part of the catchment of concern by local resource managers. An assessment of ecosystem service delivery was conducted to (1) identify plausible drivers of brownification in the study site and assess future ecosystem service delivery for stakeholders in downstream areas. An analysis of the perspective of beneficiaries, using qualitative methods, was pursued to (2) evaluate the impacts of brownification on downstream stakeholders.
   Our analyses of drivers of brownification in combination with climate change projections suggests that Kristianstads Vattenrike Biosphere Reserve will experience extreme water flows much more frequently than the system is accustomed to today, and that these water flows will be highly affected by brownification. The combination of severe summer flooding and high water color constituted a new disturbance regime and thus requires new adaptive strategies by local stakeholders. A range of coping and adaptation strategies were displayed by the farmers but also a possible transformation strategy, i.e., abandonment of the seasonally flooded meadows. Because hay making and grazing are central components in the active management of the Kristianstads Vattenrike Biosphere Reserve, to discontinue this practice would have system-wide ramifications for the Biosphere Reserve. The vulnerability of fishing in the culturally significant "Eel Coast," part of the downstream area, was also exposed.
   We argue that for environmental monitoring of slow changing variables to make sense to local stakeholders, clear links to ecosystem service benefits are required. The responsibility for this and thus for matching of social and ecological scales falls heavily on regional managers. We further argue that resilience of a social-ecological system can be estimated by observing and analyzing how local stakeholders respond to disturbances, i.e., by analyzing their response strategies.

AB  - Nowadays, the speed of changes in practical activities and scientific research in the field of sustainable development has not yet allowed to clearly indicate the role of accounting in this area. Therefore, the main goal of the paper is to present sustainability accounting in the light of positive and normative accounting theory and to propose its conceptual framework as a normative solution. Positive theories allow the author to use inductive reasoning and thus indicates the state of accounting development (opportunities and risks) in sustainable business, identifying three key gaps: theoretical, empirical and methodical. In turn, by means of normative theories, on the basis of deductive reasoning, the paper recognizes the desired directions and normatives of sustainability accounting changes. The research methodology is based on theoretical and methodological triangulation, using descriptive and comparative analysis. The main findings of the research focus on an original normative solution in the form of the author's concept of sustainability accounting based on conclusions drawn in the light of positive and normative accounting theories. The presented potential research areas are meant to pose the directions of sustainability accounting development. The results of research may determine the future growth, importance and character of sustainability accounting in business, and thus help both shareholders and stakeholders to perceive and use company achievements for sustainable development.

AB  - High levels of trust in government are important in addressing complex issues, including the realization of the mainstream sustainability agenda. However, trust in government has been declining for decades across the western world, undermining legitimacy and hampering policy implementation and planning for long-term sustainability. We hypothesize that an important factor in this decline is citizen disappointment with the current types of public participation in governance and that this could be reversed through a change from informing/consulting to a relationship of partnership. Using case studies from Western Australia, the paper investigates whether an intervention targeted at establishing a partnership relationship through mini-public, deliberative, participatory budgeting would improve trust and help the implementation of sustainability. These results show evidence of improvements in trust and provide conceptual and practical tools for government administrations wishing to close the detrimental trust gap that may hamper the implementation of a sustainability agenda.

AB  - The research reveals how micro- and small-sized enterprises can unleash future innovation to pursue sustainability. This empirical participatory action research is conducted from 2018 to 2022 in 18 multi-case micro- and small-sized enterprises. The findings reveal that these enterprises pursue sustainability through instrumental, moral and intrinsic value creation in combination. Despite the experienced uncertainty and resource limitations of the participating enterprises, they can pursue future innovation to create value for customers and society addressing, respectively, UN SDGs No. 3, 8, 9, 11, 12 and 17. None of the hitherto noted entrepreneurial literature branches can alone support micro- and small-sized enterprises to pursue future innovation. However, the literature branches illustrate individual useful strengths. Furthermore, they illustrate limitations for value creation. The illustrated useful strengths and the accompanying limitations call for context-dependent use in micro- and small- sized enterprises through the integration of the relevant specific extant literature branches to support their innovation aims, respectively, utilising opportunities, their own and others' heterogeneous behaviours and reorganising resources to unleash future sustainable innovation in an action learning approach. Further collaborative participatory action research is needed to support and enable the practical implication potential for value creation in micro- and small-sized enterprises.

AB  - The ever-increasing pressure from stakeholders and policymakers on energy companies to achieve Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) mission requires them to reinvent their policies and practices. This study aims to examine the performance of alternative business models for the oil and gas industry by employing a hybrid business analytics methodology under a fuzzy environment resulting in a generalizable model named "Sustainable Development Goals-oriented CSR Index." The proposed methodology employs a hybrid framework that utilizes bipolar Q-rung Orthopair Fuzzy (q-ROF), Multi Stepwise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis (M-SWARA), and Elimination and Choice Translating Reality (ELECTRE) methods. The findings show that (i) the proposed model is reliable and consistent throughout the similar fuzzy set value ranges, (ii) clean energy is the most important SDG-oriented CSR Index factor for the sustainable energy industry in emerging economies, (iii) drilling is the best alternative energy sourcing for the oil and gas industry, and (iv) clean energy projects have the highest priority for energy investors. The results also highlight that global warming can be managed with effective energy practices for long-term sustainability. Finally, the findings suggest that energy companies should have the essential technological infrastructure and capable workforce to increase investment efficiency.

AB  - The adoption of Sustainable Healthy Diets (SHDs) plays a crucial role in both environmental sustainability and nutritional adequacy, preventing malnutrition, obesity, and natural resource degradation. Despite extensive research on sustainability, nutrition, and human behaviors related to food consumption, gaps remain in understanding how to effectively promote the adoption of SHDs, especially among vulnerable populations. This systematic literature review (SLR) identifies and analyzes drivers and barriers that influence the adoption of SHDs in high- and upper-middle-income countries, offering insights for policymakers and stakeholders to develop informed actions. A total of 156 studies were analyzed to extract insights into the ecological, economic, human health, and sociocultural dimensions, revealing 19 key driver themes, such as environmental and nutritional education and awareness, financial incentives, and community engagement. Conversely, 22 barriers were identified, including the high costs of adopting SHDs, social and cultural resistance to dietary changes, and limited access to nutritious options, especially in low-income areas. The proposed "SHDs Barriers & Drivers" framework offers an intuitive representation of these multifaceted factors, highlighting the central role of human behavior. Limitations include the potential exclusion of relevant studies due to specific keyword selection and the focus on high- and upper-middle-income countries. The research contributes to the existing literature by offering an innovative view of how to leverage the importance of tailored and multidisciplinary approaches to foster sustainable nutrition and achieve both global health and sustainability goals.

AB  - The mining activities significantly lower the sustainability in the stone mining region. Cleaner production (CP) is more likely to be proposed to achieve the sustainable development in the mining regions. Therefore, the stone mining industry has begun to implement many CP technologies and initiatives to tackle with ecological problems caused by the mining production. However, the CP practices do not solve the problems sufficiently, because of the low level of implementations by the stone mining companies, especially in the developing countries. This paper aims to establish a support framework for the stone mining industry to develop reasonable CP strategy and avoid inefficient CP practices. Our research provides a methodology for evaluating the CP level, including the principles of establishing indicator and standard system, the method of developing evaluation algorithm and the approach of data collection. A CP evaluation system is developed for the first time in the stone mining industry, which enables the methodology to be operationalization in the real evaluation process. The study also introduced the sensitivity analysis and confidence interval (ci) theory to ensure the reliability of the system and the validity of the evaluation results, respectively. A case study in Laizhou region of China illustrates how a CP strategy develops based on the CP evaluation results. The strategy has achieved collaborative optimization of various indexes of sustainability performance in the mining region. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Achieving sustainable development globally requires multilevel and interdisciplinary efforts and perspectives. Global goals shape priorities and actions at multiple scales, creating cascading impacts realized at the local level through the direction of financial resources and implementation of programs intended to achieve progress towards these metrics. We explore ways to localize global goals to best support human well-being and environmental health by systematically comparing the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) with regionally-derived well-being dimensions that encompass components of social-ecological resilience across the Pacific Islands. Our research shows that, in the context of the Pacific, there are overlaps but also significant gaps between regional conceptions of well-being and the globally-derived SDGs. Some dimensions, related to human health and access to infrastructure and finances, are well represented in the SDGs. Other dimensions of high importance when localizing perspectives of well-being, such as those regarding connections between and across people and place and Indigenous and local knowledge, are not. Furthermore, internationally generated indicators may result in trade-offs and measurement challenges in local contexts. Creating space for place-based values in global sustainability planning aligns with international calls for transformational changes needed to achieve global goals. We identify challenges in applying SDG indicators at the local level and provide lessons learned to foster equitable and holistic approaches and outcomes for sustainability.

AB  - Providing opportunities for younger generations to voice out their views in the building of our common futures within the limits, opportunities, and dynamics of the biosphere is a central component in sustainability learning. To this aim, a novel methodological approach using participatory theater was implemented to explore future scenarios with young people in the Man and Biosphere Reserve of La Sepultura, Mexico. Three workshops were carried out as part of a broader environmental education process, aimed at enhancing critical awareness and ownership of participants' own futures. Through the reflective enactment of scenarios linked to personal actions and resources, alternative ways to think through the interconnections and the affective bonds between participants and their natural heritage were collectively represented and explored. Our process helped not only to identify different plausible futures and potential barriers to them, but also to realize positive roles that young people could play to overcome such barriers and engage with their desired futures.

AB  - There is an urgent need to engage with deep leverage points in sustainability transformations-fundamental myths, paradigms, and systems of meaning making-to open new collective horizons for action. Art and creative practice are uniquely suited to help facilitate change in these deeper transformational leverage points. However, understandings of how creative practices contribute to sustainability transformations are lacking in practice and fragmented across theory and research. This lack of understanding shapes how creative practices are evaluated and therefore funded and supported, limiting their potential for transformative impact. This paper presents the 9 Dimensions tool, created to support reflective and evaluative dialogues about links between creative practice and sustainability transformations. It was developed in a transdisciplinary process between the potential users of this tool: researchers, creative practitioners, policy makers, and funders. It also brings disciplinary perspectives on societal change from evaluation theory, sociology, anthropology, psychology, and more in connection with each other and with sustainability transformations, opening new possibilities for research. The framework consists of three categories of change, and nine dimensions: changing meanings (embodying, learning, and imagining); changing connections (caring, organizing, and inspiring); and changing power (co-creating, empowering, and subverting). We describe how the 9 Dimensions tool was developed, and describe each dimension and the structure of the tool. We report on an application of the 9 Dimensions tool to 20 creative practice projects across the European project Creative Practices for Transformational Futures (CreaTures). We discuss user reflections on the potential and challenges of the tool, and discuss insights gained from the analysis of the 20 projects. Finally, we discuss how the 9 Dimensions can effectively act as a transdisciplinary research agenda bringing creative practice further in contact with transformation research.

T2  - EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE
LA  - English
KW  - IMPACT
AB  - Farmer field schools (FFSs) were conducted in southern India to reduce pesticide input and enhance sustainability of cotton production systems. This study was carried out to determine the additional benefits of FFSs in the social and economic arena, using the sustainable livelihoods (SL) concept to frame the evaluation. Farmers who had participated in the integrated pest management (IPM) FFSs perceived a range of impacts much beyond the adoption of IPM practices. The reduced cost of cultivation allowed for financial recovery from debt and the building of physical assets. IPMFFS households and production systems were perceived by the participants to have become more economically resilient than Non-IPMFFS control groups when faced with adversity In the participants' view IPMFFSs also led to enhanced individual and community social well-being, a benefit valued in particular by the women participants. The study tested a new application of the SL conceptual framework as a tool for evaluation.

AB  - School gardens are, increasingly, an integral part of projects aiming to promote nutritional education and environmental sustainability in many countries throughout the world. In the late 1950s, FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization) and UNICEF (United Nations Children's Fund) had already developed projects to improve the dietary intake and behavior through school and community gardens. However, notwithstanding decades of experience, real proof of how these programs contribute to improving sustainability has not been well-documented, and reported findings have mostly been anecdotal. Therefore, it is important to begin a process of collecting and monitoring data to quantify the results and possibly improve their efficiency. This study's primary goal is to propose an interpretive structure-the "Sustainable Agri-Food Evaluation Methodology-Garden" (SAEMETH-G), that is able to quantifiably guide the sustainability evaluation of various school garden organizational forms. As a case study, the methodology was applied to 15 school gardens located in three regions of Kenya, Africa. This application of SAEMETH-G as an assessment tool based on user-friendly indicators demonstrates that it is possible to carry out sustainability evaluations of school gardens through a participatory and interdisciplinary approach. Thus, the hypothesis that the original SAEMETH operative framework could be tested in gardens has also been confirmed. SAEMETH-G is a promising tool that has the potential to help us understand school gardens' sustainability better and to use that knowledge in their further development all over the world.

AB  - Drone deployment in Qatar has been lagging behind that in other countries due to a wide range of reported challenges. This study developed a framework to address these operational gaps and serve as a roadmap for different stakeholders to enable drone applications for successful, safe, accountable and sustainable development. Moreover, the framework could help overcome key challenges and lay the groundwork for addressing other challenges facing UAV deployment in Qatar, thereby enabling Qatar to join the global efforts in this technological evolution. The framework was based on an analysis of the available data from previous guidelines for UAV operation and the identification of the challenges facing drone deployment in Qatar. The proposed framework was evaluated through interviews with key stakeholders in the Qatari drone steering committee. The outcomes from this evaluation supported the implementation of the framework with minor amendments and are ready to be put into practice by policymakers. In addition, it could be helpful for Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries and other countries in the region to consider this framework in their efforts to facilitate drone deployment.

AB  - Interventions to connect humans with nature at system leverage points are crucial for sustainability transformations. Identifying hotspots of deep leverage points can help provide guidance and managerial suggestions. Contemporary research on sustainability encourages public participation amongst stakeholders and the production and use of scientific knowledge. This study argues that hillside rural activities connect humans with nature but alters the natural landscape. Therefore, to determine hillside rural activity hotspots is to identify leverage points for interventions to promote human-nature reconnection. To elucidate the status of hillside rural activities in rural areas as leverage points in sustainability transformations, this study used a public participation geographic information system (PPGIS) to inventory and verify the complex and diverse relationships between hillside rural activity and land use. Using the Zhuoshui River Basin as a case study, this study hosted PPGIS workshops to collect data on stakeholders' perceptions of hillside rural activities and their spatial locations. The analysis revealed that the respondents mostly identified shallow leverage points involving facility maintenance and agricultural production, and sales. Agricultural land use and water conservancy were closely associated with deep leverage points, indicating the necessity to maintain a foundation of continuous agricultural production. Entropic land use was also associated with deep leverage points. This study found that interventions at deep leverage points can highlight the need for proper land use management and the multitude of services it provides. Land use management interventions may facilitate sustainability transformations.

AB  - In the last couple of years, circular supply chain management considered the most significant tool for the circular economy. It supports converting production and consumption patterns from linear to sustainable. Several studies have covered the implementation of circularity in different settings, but no concrete investigation exists that in-depth and explicitly explores the procurement perspective toward the circular economy. Previous studies also highlighted the need to focus on procurement or supply management perspective because it consumed an ample amount of budget in the public and private sector. To fill this gap, this study provides a state-of-the-art analysis to adopt circularity in procurement operations. This comprehensive analysis had done by reviewing the 100 peer-reviewed research papers related to the implementation of circular economy and sustainable pro-curement. This study not just covered the top-down view of literature but advances the literature by finding 55 barriers and enablers under different clusters. From the output, it is evident that efforts need to be taken from 360-degree stakeholders. However, sourcing strategy and procurement operations need to be revamped. This re-view unpacks the factors at the micro, meso, and macro-level that help academicians to create a framework for empirical investigation. Similarly, it helps practitioners, policymakers, and decision makers to achieve sustainable development goal (SDG) number 12 by incorporating circularity in procurement.(c) 2022 Institution of Chemical Engineers.

AB  - An atmospheric chemistry model (CiTTyCAT) is used to quantify the effects of trees on urban air quality in scenarios of high photochemical pollution. The combined effects of both pollutant deposition to and emission of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOC) from the urban forest are considered, and the West Midlands, metropolitan area in the UK is used as a case study. While all trees can be beneficial to air quality in terms of the deposition of O-3, NO2, CO, and HNO3, some trees have the potential to contribute to the formation of O-3 due to the reaction of BVOC and NOx. A number of model scenarios are used to develop an urban tree air quality score (UTAQS) that ranks trees in order of their potential to improve air quality. Of the 30 species considered, pine, larch, and silver birch have the greatest potential to improve urban air quality, while oaks, willows, and poplars can worsen downwind air quality if planted in very large numbers. The UTAQS classification is designed with practitioners in mind, to help them achieve sustainable urban air quality. The UTAQS classification is applicable to all urban areas of the UK and other mid-latitude, temperate climate zones that have tree species common to those found in UK urban areas. The modeling approach used here is directly applicable to all areas of the world given the appropriate input data. It provides a tool that can help to achieve future sustainable urban air quality.

AB  - While higher education usually focuses on curriculum development and research to advance sustain ability, an alternative approach is to collaborate with business. Collegiate green teams were formed to offer an innovative means to effectively promote business action on sustainability. This paper (a) describes a pilot multidisciplinary student/business internship program, and (b) uses program outcomes and surveys to discern benefits and refine a collaborative approach to taking action on sustainability. Evidence was gathered from participant surveys, administrator's observations, and the managerial assessments of green team reports and presentations to assess the collaborative model. Substantive evidence for effective team building was indicated by high scores among student team participants on measures of team cohesion, viability, satisfaction, and performance. Post-program observations by supervisors further indicated significant team learning and performance on tasks among teams. Collaborative training clearly boosted and broadened engagement among business employees and this spurred action on sustainability. The internship provided students with real-world experience and helped link managers to their local communities. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Using the Belief Action Outcome (BAO) framework as a theoretical basis, this study investigates the mechanisms that link organizational beliefs about environmental sustainability with Green information system (IS) actions that are undertaken and, hence, the organizational benefits accruing from these actions. Survey data were collected from 156 small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and analyzed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM). The results support the notion that Green IS endeavors lead to increased organizational benefits. External pressures from stakeholders and employees' attitudes to environmental sustainability affect the organizational attitude to Green IS. The attitude to Green IS is further translated into the organization's strategy and corresponding Green IS actions, resulting in organizational benefits. This study's main contribution lies in establishing a link between personal attitudes, institutional mechanisms, internal environmental/sustainability initiatives, and performance implications. Green IS adoption was empirically validated considering the SME context.

AB  - The impact of geopolitical risks (GPR) on enterprises is significant, yet the existing literature lacks a comprehensive understanding of how GPR affects environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance. This study addresses this gap by analysing data from Chinese enterprises over the period 2009 to 2021. It empirically examines the impact of GPR on ESG performance and explores the underlying mechanisms. Specifically, the analysis considers the roles of investor attention and government subsidies as moderating factors. The results indicate that GPR inhibits corporate ESG performance. State-owned enterprises are found to mitigate these adverse effects, while privately-owned enterprises tend to exacerbate them. Mechanism tests reveal that GPR negatively impacts ESG performance by increasing financing constraints and reducing financial performance. Furthermore, increased investor attention and government subsidies can alleviate the negative effects of GPR on ESG performance. These findings offer valuable insights for organisations, governments, and stakeholders, enabling them to better respond to GPR and achieve sustainable development.

AB  - The United Nation's sustainable development goals (SDGs) are interconnected and indivisible and need to be addressed in a systematic and holistic way. However, a lack of stakeholder perspective, fragmented responses, and a dearth of integration across sectors have long been perceived as the SDGs' main pitfalls. In recent years, scholars are calling to address these issues by adopting a systems engineering perspective, as this approach espouses a stakeholder-focused position, embraces a holistic and dynamic mindset, and provides a variety of technical and managerial toolkits, which can help to untangle the complexity and interactions inherent in global sustainability. Nevertheless, little has been done to map the existing literature, comprehensively review, and synthesize research evidence in this field. Therefore, this paper aims to conduct a scoping study that analyzes the extant evidence to uncover the contributions of systems engineering in advancing the SDGs. A three-phase methodology integrating natural language processing and systematic literature review is used to investigate this space. We conclude that systems engineering has been an active catalyst promoting the SDGs, and that systems engineering has the potential to support more transdisciplinary research to achieve long-term transformational and sustainable change across sectors and disciplines.

AB  - Stakeholders play vital roles in the implementation of sustainable last mile logistics solutions. Therefore, the first step in setting up successful sustainable last mile logistics is to conduct stakeholder analysis. This paper analyzes the goals of the stakeholders in the Heijendaal living lab, a city logistics project that uses two hubs for bundling goods to be delivered to the Heijendaal campus in The Netherlands. We use the Theory of Planned Behavior and Policy Deployment to present a qualitative case study, which examines the goals of stakeholders in relation to their roles in the supply chain and in the organization, and if these goals lead to their expected participation behavior. Results show that stakeholders have economic, social, and environmental goals and that some of these goals are prominent within certain groups of stakeholders along the supply chain and within the organization. In addition, the set goals do not always lead to participation behavior of stakeholders due to identified disruptions and habits. This study identifies the importance of information sharing and collaboration within the supply chain, the leading role of middle-level managers in translating strategic to operational goals, and the stimulation of behavioral factors to increase participation of stakeholders in the living lab.

AB  - Promoting rural sustainable development requires improving rural systems' self-organization to reduce dependence on external resources, which is inherently difficult in peasant economies due to low rural household income. Bottom-up collective action can help address these issues. However, few studies have examined how networks of elite and non-elite actors influence collective action and system transitions toward sustainability. This study scrutinizes the changing structures of collaborative networks in three Chinese villages through analysis of elite and non-elite actor groups and their relationships. We also examine the key elements that influence system transitions at every phase of rural sustainable development. The three case studies demonstrate that (1) elites play a vital role in the formation of collaborative networks and facilitate actor awareness; (2) spatial relationships are as essential as institutional design for successful collective action in response to sustainable development problems; (3) highly centralized collaborative networks help to improve the efficiency of the reorganization, renewal, and innovation of the village system, but the collective action outcome depends on the leadership and spatial relationships of the central actors; and (4) social memory and human capital are the most important system elements needed to exploit technology-driven windows of opportunity and achieve strong sustainability. These results provide important insights for enhancing rural systems' capacity to self-organize and capturing windows of opportunity to achieve sustainable development.

AB  - In this contribution, we assess the traditional last mile delivery concept and a framework with commercial parking bays for carriers in terms of their sustainability value for urban stakeholders. We evaluate the potential advantages and disadvantages of commercial parking bays and provide routing solutions based on the given context and stakeholder objectives. To ensure the needs of the stakeholders and the possibility of a near future implementation in the dynamic real-world system, we chose a combined approach of simulation and mathematical optimization, which allows us to investigate the concept efficiently and with a high reliability. By means of an agent-based simulation model as well as a mixed-integer linear model, we establish a heuristic routing solution for minimizing both emissions and delivery durations. We consider different scenarios in which customers are visited in a delivery radius, around a specific commercial parking bay. Outside this radius, delivery operations are conducted through second-row parking activities. Our results for the area of investigation show that the investigated scenario featuring a 200-m delivery radius around the parking bays has a 29.8% emission savings potential compared to traditional parcel delivery procedures. Moreover, optimizing the delivery routes with our green vehicle routing approach has indicated an additional savings potential of 26.4% in terms of delivery duration and 16.4% in terms of emission output for traditional parcel deliveries. Concerning the individual evaluation of the logistics context, our results indicate that dedicated commercial parking bays could be attractive to most urban stakeholders when employed utilizing a hybrid approach, combining traditional delivery activities with commercial parking bay fulfillment.

AB  - This study explores the motivations and benefits driving stakeholder engagement in Living Labs (LLs) for sustainable cultural tourism, with a focus on a case study in Split, Croatia. LLs, which foster innovation through collaboration between stakeholders, are increasingly recognized as essential for addressing sustainability challenges in tourism. Using a combination of exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis (EFA/CFA), we identify key motivations for stakeholder participation, including the desire to shift attitudes toward tourism development, enhance educational initiatives, and improve heritage interpretation. The results reveal that stakeholder engagement not only enriches tourism offerings-such as joint marketing efforts and innovative visitor experiences-but also strengthens resilience in heritage destinations. Our findings emphasize the critical role of ambidextrous management, which balances innovation and resource efficiency, in enhancing stakeholder collaboration. The study provides practical recommendations for smart governance and advocates for stakeholder-centric, bottom-up approaches in the design and management of LLs. These insights contribute to both the theoretical framework and practical implementation of sustainable cultural tourism, offering actionable strategies for policymakers and practitioners to foster local ownership and co-creation in heritage tourism development.

AB  - Introduction: The objectives of the Breakthrough Series Collaborative are to close the gap between what we know and what we do, and to contribute to continuous quality improvement (CQI) of healthcare through collaborative learning. The improvement efforts are guided by a systematic approach, combining professional and improvement knowledge.
   Objectives: To explore what the improvement teams have learnt from participating in the collaborative and from dealing with promoting and inhibiting factors encountered.
   Method: Qualitative interviews with 19 team members were conducted in four focus groups, using the Critical Incident Technique. A critical incident is one that makes significant contributions, either positively or negatively, to an activity.
   Results: The elements of a culture of improvement are revealed by the critical incidents, and reflect the eight domains of knowledge, as a product of collaborative learning. The improvement knowledge and skills of individuals are important elements, but not enough to achieve sustainable changes. 90% of the material reflects the need for a system of CQI to solve the problems that organisations experience in trying to make lasting improvements.
   Conclusion: A pattern of three success factors for CQI emerges: (1) continuous and reliable information, including measurement, about best and current practice; (2) engagement of everybody in all phases of the improvement work: the patient and family, the leadership, the professional environment and the staff; and (3) an infrastructure based on improvement knowledge, with multidisciplinary teams, available coaching, learning systems and sustainability systems.

AB  - In recent decades, the pressure from regulations and consumers for products with enhanced sustainability performance has escalated the implementation of sustainability actions by companies. For manufacturing companies specifically, Sustainable Product Development (SPD) is a key approach for reducing the sustainability impacts of the developed products, across their entire life cycle. Despite the availability of wide range of management practices for SPD to support embedding sustainability into the product development process, the extent of their application by companies remains underexplored. To fulfil this gap, an industry survey was conducted to investigate the capability of manufacturing companies to apply a consolidated set of 61 SPD management practices. The overall results which comprised 20 companies across 14 sectors revealed that most of the practices are still applied at a low capability level by most companies. This result indicates a large theory-practice gap particularly in understanding the influence of the type of business, variation in capability levels across different business processes and stages of the product development that influence the successful implementation of sustainability actions in companies. Hence, stronger collaboration between the academia and industry sectors are essential to transform new knowledge into actionable strategies.

AB  - Governments cannot effectively manage and handle disasters, particularly at the local community level, without actively engaging vulnerable people. The key to achieving sustainability in disaster recovery is community participation and information dissemination. The informal settlements' lack of access to information and public engagement hampered their ability to recovery, thus prompting this study. Therefore, many cities and intervention partnerships faced information and participation gaps in disaster risk reduction (DRR). The study's rationale was to determine the participation and communication of Khayalitjha household heads, regarding DRR information dissemination for sustainable human settlement, using a cross-sectional household survey of 295 household heads from Khayalitjha in situ informal settlement in the Free State provinces of South Africa. The security of dwelling unit tenure concept was an indirect indicator used to measure social resilience. The key findings revealed that community volunteers, ward committee members and most of the respondents, were responsible for initiating the DRR and disaster preparedness planning process. This indicated that local government needs to strengthen the human resource capacity building for DRR management information dissemination at a local level. The church, school, WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram were the preferred modes of communication for early warnings of disaster information. Contribution: Despite advocating for a multidisciplinary stakeholder approach, urban DRR studies tend to ignore communities in high disaster-risk areas. Employing social resilience, it aims to extend the DRR information dissemination strategy to in situ informal settlements beyond the communication and public participation advocacy strategies of local municipal urban cities.

AB  - The need to strengthen the connection between academia and society has received increased attention over the past years. The importance of bringing university students closer to stakeholders in society as part of their learning process is high regarding sustainable agriculture, because of its applied approach. University programs based on experiential and action-oriented learning have been developed over the past decades, but more knowledge is needed about the impact of these educational activities. In a short course in sustainable agriculture at the University of Gastronomic Sciences in Bra, Italy, we examined the impacts of experiential and action-oriented learning on competency development as well as transformational impacts on the students. We found that students improve on several core competences as a result of their participation in the short course, and also signs of deep transformational processes among the students.

AB  - Increased women's participation and employment in coastal activities in India is envisioned as a critical pathway towards a sustainable blue economy (BE). However, few studies have comprehensively explored the level/nature of women's (un)employment and participation in coastal activities in India. This could derail the attainment of sustainable livelihoods and transformative equity targets embedded under India's BE framework, Maritime Vision 2030, and Amrit Kaal 2047 agenda among others. A systematic literature review of 93 documents is conducted to (i) explore the level of women's (ex)inclusion in India's coastal activities, (ii) uncover the systemic drivers (inhibitors/enablers) of women's participation and employment, and (iii) use a system thinking perspective to highlight the interconnections of various drivers and kickstart avenues for women's empowerment. Findings reveal that India has innumerable coastal resources that could drive women's employment and participation in the BE. Coastal activities, such as fishing and services, have relatively higher prospects for women's employment. However, there is limited women's participation in coastal activities prioritized under the BE framework. Mostly, women participate in informal, secondary/indirect, and less lucrative BE activities. Livelihood vulnerabilities are forcing coastal women to engage in highly masculine jobs. Although prospects for increased women's participation in coastal activities are emerging, systemic impediments are still prevalent, including (i) socio-cultural impediments (especially social marginalization of coastal women) (ii) economic barriers (mostly poverty), (iii) environmental challenges (iv) institutional bottlenecks (e.g., limited participation of coastal women in decision-making, co-governance, and leadership), and (v) psychological impediments (including vulnerability to diseases and psychological stress). Most of the barriers are interconnected, necessitating the use of a system-thinking perspective to guide holistic women's inclusion in the BE. The developed system thinking map indicates the interactions between the various barriers to women's empowerment. Increasing women's participation in BE activities requires a holistic understanding of coastal human-ecological system interactions, rather than using fragmented, specific coastal zone strategy/ies or development mechanisms for or in a few coastal communities/people/states. By holistically obtaining transformative narratives or perspectives from different coastal communities, inclusive and collaborative mechanisms could be developed. Future research can focus on participatory engagements with coastal women, to gain novel viewpoints and perspectives on how sustainable women's empowerment should be charted, and what it should involve.

AB  - The implementation of ecopreneurship is evolving to address environmental sustainability challenges posed by industrial pollution. Scholars are exploring ways to enhance ecopreneurship implementation globally. However, there's a gap in understanding how ecopreneurship affects sustainability across economic and environmental dimensions. This study aims to explore the impact of ecopreneurship on sustainability, considering both economic and environmental indicators. The investigation was conducted through Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) methodology covering 102 ecopreneurs operating in the Tanzania food and beverage industry. The results of the study showed that implementation of ecopreneurship results in the attainment of sustainability through composite scores of 79.5%. In conclusion, this study underscores the significant impact of ecopreneurship implementation on composite sustainability, as evidenced by notable reductions in environmental emissions and improvements in economic performance within the studied industries. The findings highlight the importance of integrating environmental considerations into entrepreneurial endeavors for achieving sustainability goals. It is recommended that stakeholders actively promote and incentivize the adoption of ecopreneurship practices, invest in eco-friendly technologies, foster collaboration, implement effective monitoring mechanisms, and integrate sustainability into business strategies. The study recommends stakeholders' efforts directed towards enhancing the implementation of ecopreneurship practices in line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs, 2015-2030), specifically goal nine (9) on pollution prevention through the implementation of Eco practices-based solutions to foster innovations and sustainable industrialization. Thus, strategizing the implementation of ecopreneurship practices is considered to have an essential contribution to addressing the challenges of sustainability and therefore enriching the realization of the global sustainable development agenda.

AB  - The concept of sufficiency, recognised in the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, denotes a reduction in production and consumption in the Global North, aiming to limit energy demand and resource use while promoting wellbeing for all within planetary boundaries. Although sufficiency-oriented policies and businesses exist, they are currently outliers, and the concept remains fluid among practitioners and researchers. This paper investigates the role of sufficiency and its potential in achieving sustainable production and consumption by studying professional stakeholders across different systems of provision in Denmark. Drawing on data from seven focus groups, including a backcasting exercise, stakeholders' sociotechnical imaginaries are explored, which reveal diverse engagement and visions across organisations. Participants (n = 52) are drawn from domains of food, mobility and housing. Unique insights are provided into the interactions between systems of provision, production and regulation that pose current challenges to sustainability. Varying forms of agency are at play among different types of organisations in envisioning sufficiency, and the paper discusses the implications for the realisation of a sufficiency-oriented future. The articulation of shared sufficiency imaginaries across systems of provision is highlighted as a potential guiding step towards sustainable ways of producing and consuming in the future.

AB  - Logistics is a vital activity for the economic growth of an organization as it manages the flow of materials and information within, into, and out of the organization, as well as reverse flow. Like many other industrial processes, logistics has also been impacted by the rise of Industry 4.0 technologies, which has highlighted the significance of Logistics 4.0. However, Logistics 4.0 is mainly focused on economic benefits, while overlooking environmental and social concerns. To address this, a method is proposed that takes into account the three goals of sustainable development when selecting the best technology for internal material handling activities. Firstly, a comprehensive literature review was conducted to examine the application of 4.0 technologies in logistics processes and their impact on economic, environmental, and social sustainability. Secondly, based on the findings of the review, a three-level analytic hierarchy process was proposed to identify the optimal 4.0 technology for internal logistics. To demonstrate the practicality of the proposed method, it was tested on three companies. The results showed that additive manufacturing, exoskeletons, and collaborative robots are the most suitable options for achieving sustainable development goals within Logistics 4.0.

AB  - Community wildlife management is being tested across the tropics as a means of promoting the conservation and sustainable use of wildlife resources. Key to successful programs is the effective participation of local hunters and communities in monitoring, planning, decision-making and implementation. We evaluate one method to achieve this participation, namely hunter self-monitoring. Between 1997 and 2000, Izoceno hunters from 22 communities in the Bolivian Chaco have voluntarily participated in monitoring their hunting activities, measuring and recording data on captured animals and hunting methods in personal notebooks. Despite the lack of remuneration, participation exceeds 60% of active hunters. However, the written information and specimens provided are not complete, and are biased according to hunting methods and prey characteristics. Complementary research is essential to answer specific research questions. Nevertheless, hunter self-monitoring serves to raise awareness of wildlife management issues at the communal or indigenous territory level, as evidenced by preliminary actions taken by hunters and communities in the Izozog.

AB  - Purpose
   The purpose of this paper is to quantify and evaluate transport sustainability from an integrated perspective. It is argued that transportation systems being interdisciplinary and complex, the integrated approach towards quantification and evaluation would present its sustainability goals' attainment in a much better way.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The proposed integrated methodology is divided into five major steps that are sub-divided. It adopts a three-tier classification system i.e. pillar, sub-division and indicator. In total, 116 sustainable transportation indicators (STIs) were classified into 10 subdivisions corresponding to three sustainability pillars. The weighting and aggregation of STIs were done using a combination of a statistical tool called principal component analysis/factor analysis, a machine learning tool called fuzzy logic and equal weighting method. The final output that the proposed integrated methodology generates is a new composite index called the integrated sustainable transportation index (IIST).
   Findings
   To check the credibility of the proposed integrated methodology, it was applied to 26 states and the National Capital Territory (NCT) of Delhi, India. Based on the computed IIST, 27 study zones were ranked and mapped. The results showed that while Tamil Nadu (0.643), Telangana (0.574) and Maharashtra (0.564) were the best-performing states, Goa (0.347), Chhattisgarh (0.436) and Meghalaya (0.439) were the worst-performing states, as far as the relative transportation sustainability is concerned.
   Practical implications
   The proposed integrated methodology could be useful for transportation evaluators, planners and policymakers who can recognize, track and improve the strengths and overcome the weaknesses within a transportation system.
   Originality/value
   The novelty of this research work is that it uses a multi-stage multi-tool approach to quantify and evaluate transport sustainability that minimizes the demerits of single-stage individual tools while maximizing their merits.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to describe the development, implementation and initial evaluation of the Geriatric Flying Squad's reciprocal referral pathways with emergency responders including New South Wales Ambulance, Police and Fire and Rescue. These innovative pathways and model of care were developed to improve access to multidisciplinary services for vulnerable community dwelling frail older people with the intent of improving health and quality of life outcomes by providing an alternative to hospital admission. Design/methodology/approach This is a case study describing the review of the Geriatric Flying Squad's referral database and quality improvement initiative to streamline referrals amongst the various emergency responders in the local health district. The implementation and initial evaluation of the project through online survey are further described. Findings Sustainable cross-sector collaboration can be achieved through building reciprocal pathways between an existing rapid response geriatric outreach service and emergency responders including Ambulance, Police, Fire and Rescue. Historically, emergency services would have transferred this group to the emergency department. These pathways exemplify person-centred care, underpinned by a multidisciplinary, rapid response team, providing an alternative referral pathway for first responders, with the aim of improving whole of health outcomes for frail older people. Practical implications Enablers of these pathways include a single point of contact for agencies, extended hours to support referral pathways, education to increase capacity and awareness, comprehensive and timely comprehensive assessment and ongoing case management where required and contemporaneous cross-sector collaboration to meet the medical and psychosocial needs of the client. Originality/value The Geriatric Flying Squad reciprocal pathways are a unique model of care with a multi-agency approach to addressing frail older people's whole of health needs.

AB  - Non-technical summary All of humanity is facing the increasingly urgent challenge of finding pathways to the emergence of new, more sustainable patterns of living that promotes the co-evolution of natural and cultural systems. We address this challenge by proposing changes in scientific and scholarly research communities and transformations in roles, resources, actors, and institutions of scholarship (i.e., natural and social sciences, humanities, and arts), which can contribute substantially and effectively to co-designing solutions for sustainable, just, and equitable human societies. Technical summary The critical challenge facing humanity is the increasingly urgent need to find and implement pathways that lead humankind into a new stage of dynamic equilibrium that promotes the co-evolution of natural and cultural systems. We address this challenge for scientific and scholarly research communities and the transformations in roles, resources, actors, and institutions of scholarship (encompassing natural and social sciences, humanities, and arts), which can contribute substantially and effectively to co-designing solutions for coping with unsustainable practices and systemic risks. Our perspective builds upon a series of four workshops to identify and address global sustainability challenges at a regional scale. It is anchored in the view that nature and society are inextricably interwoven, that planetary boundaries are fundamentally societal, rather than solely environmental issues, that viable solutions to the global challenges mentioned above can be developed and most effectively implemented at a regional to local scale in conjunction with substantive changes in the education systems at all levels, and that these considerations require a complex adaptive systems approach to seeking and implementing solutions. We call for rethinking, finding creative approaches, and acting to make scholarship more capable of effectively creating just and equitable sustainable futures in diverse cultures and contexts. Social media summary Transforming scholarship and education to enable co-design of societal transformations to sustainable futures.

AB  - Collaboration in tourism is widely perceived as a solution for achieving success and for ensuring sustainability in tourist destinations. However, collaboration is a complex and dynamic process, and although there is a growing interest in understanding its mechanisms, much remains unexplored on the matter. The aim of this paper is to operationalise a network approach in analysing characteristics of collaboration in tourism and then to reveal structural weaknesses and strengths from a destination management perspective. The background for analysis is a well-known tourist destination in Romania (Vatra Dornei) that can be considered illustrative for a large spectrum of Eastern European destinations. Methodologically, Social Network Analysis (SNA) techniques were employed, centred on matters related to density and centrality of the tourism network. The results reveal a series of deficiencies inside the network, which have to be addressed by policymakers: (i) a general low level of collaboration; (ii) poor communication between public and private sectors; (iii) a reduced number of central stakeholders but high diversity regarding their fields of activity. The study contributes to the literature by advancing knowledge on particularities of collaboration among tourism stakeholders, while also adding evidence to the utility of SNA in understanding relational dynamics specific to tourism destinations.

AB  - Wastage of food is a significant problem for worldwide sustainability due to the quick pace of industrialization, increasing demand for food, and worries about food safety. Approximately one-third of the food produced for human consumption is lost or discarded, significantly negatively affecting society, the environment, and the economy. To address this challenge, this study proposes a model for minimizing wastage in the agri-food supply chain (AFSC) for developing economies focusing on sustainability. The study combines critical success factors theory, stakeholder theory, and fuzzy set theory and applies the evidential reasoning approach to create a framework that identifies and prioritizes the most crucial factors for waste minimization in the AFSC of developing countries. These factors are evaluated based on social, environmental, economic, and operational criteria. The study identifies seventeen critical success factors for waste minimization in AFSC. Among these factors, strategic planning, logistics, inventory management, physical and resilient infrastructure, technology planning, and digital transformation are the most significant, necessitating the utmost attention. The study conducts a trade-off analysis to determine the importance and changing behavior of CSFs. Findings will help the managers and the decision-makers develop successful policies and make well-informed decisions promoting sustainable development by reducing waste in the AFSC.

AB  - The successful cohabitation of Indigenous and sustainability sciences has much to offer the contemporary world of sustainable development in Indigenous communities. While the potentiality of authentic and respectful combination of these two worlds has been advanced significantly within the literature, there is still a lack of meaningful uptake of the potential methods and outcomes within the sustainability science space. This article is grounded in our collective experience in undertaking a Kaupapa Maori research project (an Indigenous research framework that reflects an approach that is by, with, and for Maori) with Kati Huirapa Runaka ki Puketeraki, a Maori tribal community in the South Island of New Zealand, to achieve their sustainable development aspirations. Our aim is to reflect on and share nuanced lessons in building trusting researcher/Indigenous community relationships. We identify three interdependent principles, framed within a kaupapa Maori perspective including (a) Toitu te matauranga (processes of sustaining and valuing Maori knowledges), (b) Whakawhanaungatanga (processes of establishing relationships), and (c) Kotahitanga (processes of unity and collective action). This article offers insight into the potential of Indigenous/non-Indigenous collaborations that aims to contribute to meaningful transformation of sustainability science research more generally.

AB  - The combined and interacting effects of land-use change, resource extraction and climate change threaten the sustainability of millions of mainly smallholder farms in tropical agroforested landscapes. In many of these landscapes, coordinated action among stakeholders at landscape level would help to address challenges such as pests and diseases, price crises and climate change. However, methods to facilitate the co-production of sustainable landscape management in such complex multi-stakeholder systems are currently largely lacking. In this paper, we present a novel approach to explore pathways for the sustainability transition of agroforestry systems. By combining participatory forecasting and backcasting approaches, based on serious games and future vision development, we explore relevant agroforestry management strategies for reaching sustainable future coffee-based agroforestry landscapes. We focused our research on the challenges faced in the main coffee-producing area in Nicaragua. Here, we organized five participatory game sessions to explore farmer decision-making processes, farming strategies and to develop new networks and stimulate social learning among farmers. In the associated backcasting workshop, the most influential game session participants joined technicians, researchers and municipality officials to collectively envision sustainable future landscape management. In all game sessions, farmers developed diversified coffee-based agroforested landscapes characterised by increased density and diversity of shade trees, for the purpose of income diversification as well as forest conservation. During the backcasting workshop, the participants identified policy instruments and community-based solutions for the transition to sustainable landscapes. Our participatory approach facilitated discussion on landscape planning among farmers and other stakeholders and allowed the outline of a pathway towards the collective envisioned future landscape. The combination of participatory forecasting and backcasting proved to be a helpful tool to support multi-stakeholder processes towards sustainable landscape management in this and other complex landscapes.

AB  - Russia ranks among the top five countries worldwide in terms of carbon emissions, with the energy, transportation, and manufacturing sectors as the major contributors. This poses a significant threat to both current and future generations. Russia faces challenges in achieving Sustainable Development Goal 13, necessitating the implementation of more innovative policies to promote environmental sustainability. Considering this alarming situation, this study investigates the role of financial regulations, energy price uncertainty, and climate policy uncertainty in reshaping sectoral CO2 emissions in Russia. This study utilizes a time-varying bootstrap rollingwindow causality (BRW) approach using quarterly data from 1990 to 2021. The stability test for parameters indicates instability, suggesting that the full sample causality test may yield incorrect inferences. Thus, the BRW approach is employed for valid inferences. Our findings confirm the time-varying negative impact of financial regulations on CO2 emissions from energy, manufacturing, and transportation sectors. Additionally, findings confirm time-varying positive impact of energy prices and climate policy uncertainty on CO2 emissions from the energy, manufacturing, and transportation sectors. Strong financial regulations and stable energy and climate policies are crucial for achieving sustainability, highlighting significant policy implications for policymakers and stakeholders.

AB  - Background: The primary objective of this investigation is to scrutinize the underlying motivations that may prompt those responsible for health to adopt models of collaborative consumption (CC) as business innovation. Furthermore, the study seeks to assess the congruence of determinants influencing the intention to utilize CC in healthcare, comparing perspectives between responsible for health and digital health consumers. Methods: Two studies based on the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) have been conducted. Study 1 uses a qualitative approach to analyze the determinants in use CC in healthcare of responsible for health of the Italian's National Health Service. Study 2 uses a quantitative approach to analyze a sample of healthcare consumers, their salient beliefs, digital health literacy, and perceived own health status in determining the intention to use CC in healthcare. Results: Responsible for health recognize both the benefits, like improved efficiency, and the drawbacks, such as digital illiteracy and privacy concerns. Consumer data reveals that attitudes, social norms, perceived control, and digital literacy significantly influence the intention to use CC in healthcare, with education and age being moderating factors, whereas income is not impactful. Conclusion: The research ends with a discussion of these findings and their strategic implications for managing decision support systems in healthcare. The research highlights the need for innovation-based strategies in the health system, proposing a new socio-technical health domain to improve management through a participatory approach. The approach emphasizes business innovation, service quality, and cost-efficiency. Finally, the research addresses the gaps highlighted in CC in healthcare adoption, underscoring public-private collaboration and practical strategies for sustainable success.

AB  - Sea-level rise (SLR) is a critical consequence of climate change, posing significant threats to coastal regions worldwide. Accurate and efficient assessment of potential inundation areas is crucial for effective coastal planning and adaptation strategies. This study aimed to explore the utility of free and open-source software for geospatial (FOSS4G) tools for mapping SLR inundation, providing cost-effective solutions that are accessible to researchers and policymakers. We employed a combination of geospatial data, including high-resolution elevation models, tidal data, and projected SLR scenarios. Utilizing widely available FOSS4G tools, like QGIS, GDAL/OGR, and GRASS GIS, we developed an integrated workflow to map inundation extents, using a passive bathtub approach for various SLR scenarios. We demonstrate the approach through a case study in Virginia Key, Florida, however, the methodology can be replicated in any area where the input datasets are available. This paper demonstrates that FOSS4G tools offer a reliable and accessible means to map SLR inundation, empowering stakeholders to assess coastal vulnerabilities and to devise sustainable adaptation measures. The open-source approach facilitates collaboration and reproducibility, fostering a comprehensive understanding of the potential impacts of SLR on coastal ecosystems and communities.

KW  - ENERGY
AB  - In the context of the evolving landscape of reduction in carbon emissions and integration of renewable energy, this study uses system dynamics (SD) modeling to explore the interconnected dynamics of carbon trading (CT), tradable green certificate (TGC) trading, and electricity markets. Using differential equations with time delays, the study provides a comprehensive analysis of structural relationships and feedback mechanisms within and between these markets. Key findings reveal the intricate interplay between carbon prices, green certificate prices, and electricity prices under various coupling mechanisms. For example, under the three-market coupling mechanism, carbon trading prices stabilize around 150 Yuan/ton, while green certificate prices reach a peak of 0.45 Yuan/KWH, impacting electricity prices, which fluctuate between 0.33 and 1.09 Yuan / KWH during the simulation period. These quantitative results shed light on nuanced fluctuations in market prices and the dynamics of anticipated purchases and sales volumes within each market. The insights gleaned from this study offer valuable implications for policy makers and market stakeholders in navigating the complexities of carbon emission reduction strategies, the integration of renewable energy and market equilibrium. By understanding the dynamics of multi-market coupling, stakeholders can better formulate policies and strategies to achieve sustainable energy transitions and mitigate impacts of climate change.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this study is to elicit the success factors from empirical evidence, as construction industry requires an improved understanding of factors for managing projects to positive outcomes. Increased stakeholder involvement, including the new technologies, achieving sustainability and safeguarding health and safety, whilst at the same time facing uncertainties, it is crucial to examine whether there are new factors that drive construction projects to succeed, especially from a value-driven perspective. Design/methodology/approach Using a systematic review approach, this research reviewed 172 studies published after 2004. When compared to a comprehensive project success factor framework presented by Chan et al. in 2004, 19 factors are considered new since 2004. Findings Though several scholarly outputs highlighted significant improvements to project operations and innovations in equipment and techniques, there has not been a comprehensive oversight since Chan's et al. (2004) conceptual framework. This paper investigates 16 years of industry changes and identified two new success factors categories (innovation and sustainability) and 19 new factors that add to Chan's et al. (2004) study. Consequently, a new framework of factors affecting project success was developed. Originality/value This paper was very specific in its attempt to find the new and additional success factors for managing construction projects. A new conceptual framework, which includes the newly identified factors, was then developed that will create a greater awareness of stakeholders' concerns and ultimately contribute to significant improvement in developing project objectives and defining success measures.

AB  - Ecotourism, over time, has emerged as a preferred strategy for resource utilization within protected areas of developing nations, as it effectively bridges the gap between ecological conservation imperatives and the imperative for local economic development. This study aims to comprehensively analyze the multifaceted impacts of ecotourism on local communities, with due consideration given to its environmental, social, and economic dimensions. Furthermore, the research endeavors to evaluate the degree of stakeholder engagement in fostering sustainable tourism practices within ecotourism initiatives. Thematic content analysis has been used and the data for the analysis has been sourced through field observations, key informant discussions and different secondary sources. This research examines the dynamic interaction between local communities and ecotourism aspects in the Chilika Wetland in India, using the DPSIR (Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response) framework. It promotes a comprehensive decision-making method that considers the Triple Bottom Line and Community-oriented Collaborative approach. Findings underscore the potential for Chilika's ecosystem restoration and mitigating adverse tourist impacts with effective ecotourism governance. The need for collaboration among stakeholders becomes crucial for the effective administration of ecotourism, as shown by the instance of Mangalajodi, which exemplifies the successful outcome of community-led ecotourism. Nevertheless, certain prerequisites, such as knowledge dissemination, training, financial support, cultural promotion, eco-friendly infrastructure, and a commitment to conservation, have been recognized as necessary for ensuring long-term community involvement in ecotourism initiatives.

AB  - The environmental performance of various aspects of animal origin food supply chains has been the focus of research in recent years, and has provided useful information. However, there were no studies that covered the entire egg supply chain from different perspectives. The aim of this study was to analyze the majority of environmental impacts in the table egg supply chain comprising of three subsystems: farms, retail outlets and households, with quantification of each individual subsystem and the entire supply chain. All data were gathered from 30 farms, 50 retail stores and 300 households in Serbia. In parallel, the perception and ranking of environmental impacts along the supply chain were also evaluated. Finally, the quality function deployment for the environment was used to determine the degree of correlation between the set of environmental requirements and the identified environmental impacts. Results revealed that the greatest environmental impacts come from the production of feed for laying hens and the use of natural resources, and they contribute the most to the pollution of each individual environmental indicator. Additionally, the results show the differences in the environmental impacts of each individual subsystem and identify opportunities to mitigate them through the optimization of animal feed, energy consumption and household food waste management. The overall perspective of the egg supply chain points to climate change effects as the most important. The differences in the perceptions of environmental impacts along the entire egg supply chain suggest the need for promotion of mitigation strategies to all stakeholders that would encourage them to achieve sustainable development goals.

AB  - The rapid advancement of the building sector in the last decade has led to a significant increase in energy usage, accounting for about 40% of the world's total energy consumption. With about 80% of this energy derived from fossil fuels, the resulting greenhouse gas emissions contribute to global warming. The zero energy buildings (ZEB) concept offers a promising solution to reduce the energy and carbon footprint of buildings using renewable energy resources. This paper presents a scientometric and systematic review of solar energy techniques applied in ZEBs. Key contributions include a discussion of practical passive and active solar techniques, identification of knowledge gaps and limitations in recent studies, and scientific mapping and discussion of hot topics, keywords, and global research efforts. The review highlights the need for more experimental studies, research in diverse climatic conditions, academia-industry collaborations at national and international levels, and zero energy status consideration in the industrial settings. Additionally, development of skilled labor through training programs are essential for the widespread adoption of ZEBs. By leveraging the insights provided, stakeholders and researchers can make informed decisions to achieve sustainable and economically viable ZEBs.

AB  - PurposeThe paper seeks to assist public sector leaders to take a balanced and impactful approach to transformation programmes which aim to deliver integrated healthcare. The paper highlights the balance of attention paid in these programmes across elements of leadership, strategy, structure and people, and aims to highlight where this balance can sit to encourage more successful and sustainable transformations, with an increased focus on interpersonal and inter-professional engagement and interaction across workforce and service users.Design/methodology/approachThe project involved a literature review which identified themes that were in turn used to inform an approach to a desk review of journal articles written about past integration programmes in healthcare. A coding framework was developed to assess the articles in the desk review to identify where the focus of attention lay in the approaches to integration.FindingsThere is a spread of activity across all four themes (leadership, strategy, structure and people) in the assessed cases, but the emphasis tends to be towards static, short-term approaches, with a noticeable lack of focus on the aspects required to deliver long-term sustained transformation. There is a need for improved balance between structural and relational approaches to transformation.Research limitations/implicationsThe paper focuses on nine examples of transformation programmes and would benefit from further development and use of the coding framework.Practical implicationsThe framework that emerges from this project can contribute to the development of a proactive model to assist transformation leads and decision makers bring a more balanced, thoughtful and impactful approach to integrating health and care services. In particular, the findings point to an overuse of structural approaches to change and transformation, which could include project management methods, for example, which become the product of the initiatives, rather than enablers of leaders' visions and people's interpersonal and interprofessional engagement and interactions.Originality/valueBuilding on existing research, this paper makes a valuable contribution to the discourse on how to deliver the required health and care integration agenda in a more accessible way and sustainably, moving away from short-term, quick-fix approaches and considers how to accommodate the role of interpersonal interaction as the vehicle for change.

AB  - Introduction: Transformative transdisciplinary research (TTDR) aims to address complex sustainability issues of our times by engaging researchers from different disciplines, practitioners, individuals, and policymakers. Objective: This literature review is a first structured effort to understand how marine-coastal research published in English and Spanish can drive transformative change towards sustainability in Costa Rica (n = 30 articles) and is expected to foster critical reflection on the role of scientific systems in the design, production, and use of knowledge. Results: The results show that in Costa Rica, knowledge production remains largely unidirectional, with stakeholder consultation prevailing over co-production. It highlights the need to foster collaborative research that includes historically underrepresented groups, such as women. Power and funding dynamics determine research priorities, with efforts concentrated in the North Pacific, while the Caribbean region remains underrepresented. Conclusions: Furthermore, we highlight ways forward to transformative research: a focus on leverage points such as co-production of knowledge, creation of safe spaces for inclusive dialogue, and reform of funding models to support long-term interdisciplinary collaboration. As Costa Rica will co-host the upcoming Ocean Conference in France, this moment presents an opportunity to align national research efforts with global transformative trends, ensuring that marine research evolves towards more inclusive and action-oriented frameworks.

AB  - Background: Implementation strategies are imperative for the successful adoption and sustainability of complex evidence-based public health practices. Creating a learning collaborative is one strategy that was part of a recently published compilation of implementation strategy terms and definitions. In partnership with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other partner agencies, the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials recently convened a multi-state Learning Community to support cross-state collaboration and provide technical assistance for improving state capacity to increase access to long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) in the immediate postpartum period, an evidence-based practice with the potential for reducing unintended pregnancy and improving maternal and child health outcomes. During 2015-2016, the Learning Community included multidisciplinary, multi-agency teams of state health officials, payers, clinicians, and health department staff from 13 states. This qualitative study was conducted to better understand the successes, challenges, and strategies that the 13 US states in the Learning Community used for increasing access to immediate postpartum LARC.
   Methods: We conducted telephone interviews with each team in the Learning Community. Interviews were semi-structured and organized by the eight domains of the Learning Community. We coded transcribed interviews for facilitators, barriers, and implementation strategies, using a recent compilation of expert-defined implementation strategies as a foundation for coding the latter.
   Results: Data analysis showed three ways that the activities of the Learning Community helped in policy implementation work: structure and accountability, validity, and preparing for potential challenges and opportunities. Further, the qualitative data demonstrated that the Learning Community integrated six other implementation strategies from the literature: organize clinician implementation team meetings, conduct educational meetings, facilitation, promote network weaving, provide ongoing consultation, and distribute educational materials.
   Conclusions: Convening a multi-state learning collaborative is a promising approach for facilitating the implementation of new reimbursement policies for evidence-based practices complicated by systems challenges. By integrating several implementation strategies, the Learning Community serves as a meta-strategy for supporting implementation.

AB  - Despite negative consequences from the COVID-19 pandemic, there are certain positive effects from this crisis including the restoration of natural resources. Using the institutional theory framework, this paper aims to explore how sustainable tourism management can be applied to manage recovered natural resources after the COVID-19 crisis. Qualitative research in the form of in-depth interviews, focus group interviews, and observations was conducted to demonstrate how Krabi tourism stakeholders could collaborate among themselves in order to sustain recovered natural resources after the COVID-19 pandemic. Informants of the study are Krabi tourism stakeholders; i.e., tourism business owners and managers, members of tourism associations, government officers, CBT members, that are recruited by purposive sampling method. This research has shed light on how tourism stakeholders can co-create tourism policies to respond to sustainability issues using the institutional process. In order to develop a successful sustainable tourism management plan, we propose that the plan should consist of three aspects-environmental, social, and economic. The findings from this research offer benefits to tourism stakeholders around the world for reshaping sustainable tourism management in order to take care of magnificent tourism resources after the COVID-19 outbreak.

AB  - Fisheries are complex social-ecological systems, meaning that the achievement of 'sustainable' fisheries demands a multifaceted approach, involving ecological, economic, social, and institutional dimensions. Addressing these diverse concerns requires the collection and synthesis of new sources of information by science-advising bodies and the engagement of multiple knowledge types from rightsholders and stakeholders. The 'modernized' (2019) Fisheries Act in Canada allows for a diverse range of considerations to form the basis of fisheries management decisions, including knowledge from community or industry groups, but it remains unclear where and when such information is available, how this information is prioritized, who contributes to information-gathering processes, and what the management consequences of information use might be. The present study uses a selection of science-advising documents and briefing notes for decision makers to explore the information and priorities informing fisheries management decisions in Atlantic Canada, with a focus on how rightsholders and stakeholders contribute to the process. These findings can inform efforts to adopt an inclusive and participatory approach to evidence-based decision making to achieve sustainable fisheries, in the broadest sense of the word.

AB  - Ecosystem management (EM) is a process for addressing environmental problems. It draws on research from multiple disciplines in order to ensure long-term maintenance of socio-ecological systems. The present study evaluates the definition of interdisciplinary work among researchers involved in generating data use (EM). The goal is twofold: to generate further discussions in research supporting EM, and to better situate this research in the broader context of interdisciplinary science. Using an online questionnaire, data was collected from 119 researchers. A cluster analysis identified both distinct and shared understandings of the concept. A logistic regression analysis identified the extent to which personal characteristics and researchers' understandings of interdisciplinary theory determine definitions of interdisciplinary work. Researchers differ on the terminology but share an understanding about what it is: both a 'way to do research' and a 'way of thinking about research'. Differences between researchers suggest a growing interest in developing deeper engagements with theoretical discussions of interdisciplinarity. Results are discussed in the context of the current state of development of research for EM and its contributions to sustainability.

AB  - Integrating crop and livestock activities at the farm level is commonly proposed by research programs in sub-Saharan Africa as a way to sustainably improve farm productivity. This integration process requires farmers to change their knowledge, perceptions and practices to achieve sustainable intensification. This article presents a participatory support approach based on an analysis of farmers' current practices and knowledge and a simulation tool designed to facilitate interaction with farmers. It was tested in western Burkina Faso with 18 farmers representing three farm types defined by their balance between crop and livestock activities. Although a low level of crop-livestock integration was observed, every farmer recognized a positive link between the production of organic fertilizer and plant production. However, only one third of the farmers linked plant production with fodder and animal production. By building and simulating various integration scenarios, every farmer developed a deeper understanding of systemic interactions between crop and livestock activities on his farm. Project scenarios including the storage of biomass and animal stabling were evaluated. Although these innovations improved the farms' capacity to fertilize cereals and to feed herds, the structural changes involved were perceived to be difficult to implement either for economic reasons at the farm level or because they involved changes in biomass management at the community level. However, the support process led to tactical changes the following year, with 80% of the farmers increasing their storage of crop residues and organic manure. The approach was useful for farmers to evaluate and eventually implement possible innovations, and for researchers to better understand the constraints and limits farmers face when seeking to better integrate crop and livestock activities.

AB  - Innovative ideas are essential to sustainable development. Students' innovative potential in higher education for sustainable development (HESD) has so far been neglected. Innovation is often associated with an interdisciplinary approach. However, the results of research on diversity and its role in innovation are inconsistent. The present study takes a longitudinal approach to investigating student teams in project-based learning courses in HESD in Germany. This study examines how innovation develops in interdisciplinary student teams in contrast to monodisciplinary student teams. The results of the latent change approach from a sample of 69 student teams indicate significant changes in students' innovation over time. Monodisciplinary student teams outperform interdisciplinary student teams in idea promotion (convincing potential allies) at the beginning, whereas interdisciplinary student teams outperform monodisciplinary student teams in idea generation (production of novel and useful ideas) in the midterm. There is no difference in the long term. The results indicate that interdisciplinary student teams have an advantage in the generation of novel ideas but need time to leverage their access to different discipline-based knowledge. We discuss practical implications for the design of interdisciplinary learning with strategies to support students in the formation phase in project-based learning in HESD.

AB  - Building a more sustainable society is an urgent requirement for today's service-oriented manufacturing enterprises, such as automobile maintenance firms. In automobile maintenance service, traditional painting process scheduling scheme usually only considers the profits of enterprises, ignoring the requirements of customers or other stakeholders. To address this gap and achieve sustainable operations of enterprises in the long term, this paper concentrated on the vehicle scheduling of painting process problem with the concern of the demands of managers, workers, customers, governments and non-government environmental protection organisations. This problem was formulated as a nonlinear 0-1 integer programming model to minimise makespan (MP), total pollutant emissions (TPE) and total customers' perceived dissatisfaction (TCPDS). A genetic algorithm was designed to solve the model, and a practical case using data from both the information system and the survey was performed to test the performance of the proposed model and algorithm. Computational results revealed that the genetic algorithm performed well in terms of validity and stability. Pareto solutions demonstrated that optimising task sequences helped increase customers' perceived satisfaction while improving the makespan of vehicle painting, decreased paint waste, and reduced worker health and safety risks. Some of the increases in the percentage of well-timed customer service reservations were catalysed by the method that combined tiered pricing, related to delivery times, the automobile painting efficiency, which improved customers' perceived satisfaction. This paper also further guides managers to incorporate sustainable development into operations in service-oriented manufacturing enterprises.

AB  - An economical approach for incorporating Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) onto DP-2 vessels is presented in this research. The paper deals with developing a Battery Optimization for Optimal Sizing and Throughput Energy Regulation (BOOSTER) framework for putting research findings into practice by optimizing battery size, technology choice and power generation scheduling while considering battery degradation. Twelve battery sizes are analyzed based on three key performance metrics: return on investment, payback period, and years of profitability. A Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) is developed to operate the energy and power management system of the vessel in a fuel and economically efficient manner. The study considers two load profiles of a DP-2 vessel operating near Taiwan and the North Sea. Our findings emphasize the significance of taking battery ownership costs in the form of energy throughput cost and fuel price into account, resulting in a longer battery lifetime and higher return on investment. The research also proposes a BESS operation matrix that provides vessel operators with valuable information on BESS usage for economic benefits. This matrix translates analytics and decision-making into tangible actions that can be implemented in real-time operations. Based on the findings, energy systems may be optimized for a sustainable future, which benefits vessel operators and industry stakeholders.

AB  - This paper contributes to scholarship on adaptive water governance (AWG), following policy reforms in South Africa, through a focus on systemic feedbacks for learning and adaptation as critical aspects of AWG. We draw insights from three innovative and evolving water governance experiments. In 1998 South Africa adopted integrated water resources management (IWRM) as a transformative approach for achieving an equitable, sustainable, and decentralized stakeholder-centered water resources governance: all hallmarks of an enabling environment for a two-decade history of AWG, although not named as such. Progress in AWG is explored by using a longitudinal, evaluative exploration of three cases in two transboundary basins in South Africa, with a focus on the unfolding enabling environment for achieving sustainability and equity. Building on previous work, we present and discuss a range of enablers that are shown to function systemically to support feedbacks and build adaptive capacity and resilience in complex and uncertain river systems. In the Crocodile Basin, meta-governance arrangements that created an enabling space for collaborative experimentation and learning proved critical as feedbacks were progressively strengthened and embedded through evolving social and institutional arrangements. The enabling environment also supported a networked, blended system of stakeholder-and state-led platforms that have co-evolved through experimentation and learning. Despite progress, long-term persistence of action-learning feedbacks appears less certain in the Olifants Basin cases. We suggest that enabling meta-governance arrangements that offer an institutional home within which to embed learning is critical. The need to explore alternative networked governance arrangements and to explicitly manage for feedbacks that enhance learning at multiple scales is emphasized. We conclude with recommendations for future work on AWG, including reconciling differences between AWG and IWRM that originally framed South African reforms.

The dataset covers three years (2018 to 2020) with 300 firmyear observations. Environmental and Social disclosure scores were calculated using the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) framework and derived from the content analysis of the companies' reports accessed from respective corporate or Bursa Malaysia's websites. A binary scoring method (one for disclosure or zero, otherwise for each environmental and social disclosure item) was employed. This scoring process underwent three stages of rigorous manual verification protocol: initial check and scoring by research assistants, review by the research team, and a final review by an independent external accounting firm for validation. This dataset is valuable for academics, practitioners, and policymakers to evaluate corporate alignment with UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) #12, encouraging Responsible Consumption and Production, and shape strategic policies to meet Bursa compliance for enhanced corporate sustainability. It further aids in investigating associations between governance factors and other firm characteristics with environmental and social disclosures. & COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - Freight Villages (FV) are logistics clusters in which all activities related with freight transportation are realized. Various operators conduct business under one roof in FVs. Coordination and collaboration are the essential part for creating harmony to achieve sustainability. The establishment of such facilities in Turkey has been realized in late 2000s. In this paper, the aim is to provide a broad overview of the FVs in Turkey and shed light into their potential for the future. To do so site visits to all existing operational public FVs and a private FV have been made, where interviews with the management units have been conducted and comparisons to global counterparts have been made. As a result of these, it has been observed that currently, FVs in Turkey are overwhelmed due to lack of coordination and collaboration. However, also light has been shed into possible alternative working principles for Turkish FVs, and it has been showed that if coordination and collaboration could be realized, significant positive effects can be achieved in terms of different aspects regarding sustainability and social equity.

AB  - The Biosphere Reserve (BR) concept is an approach that simultaneously reconciles and promotes conservation of natural and cultural diversity, environmentally and socioculturally sustainable economic development, and research. This study focuses on the legal recognition of the BR concept as a tool for sustainable development (SD) in Ukraine, and what impact legislation has had on BR implementation. The BR concept has been incorporated into Ukrainian nature conservation legislation. However, interviews with locals engaged with the Roztochya BR initiative revealed that the aim to promote sustainability through stakeholder collaboration was poorly implemented. Legislative misplacement of the BR concept created misunderstandings among local people during the emergence of the Roztochya BR initiative. BR implementation may be improved by (1) choosing national terminology describing the concept carefully, because this affects stakeholder perceptions, (2) ensuring that legislation for BRs has a multi-sectoral character, and (3) ensuring that those who implement BR initiatives have the understanding, knowledge and will to lead and facilitate SD as a collaborative social learning process towards ecological, economic, social and cultural sustainability.

AB  - Tailings are one of the major categories of industrial waste, the disposal of which is problematic from an environmental viewpoint. The weathering of sulfide bearing waste materials commonly generates acidity and dissolved metals in the environment creating acid mine drainage (AMD). Typically, the chosen reclamation solutions emphasize low construction costs over environmental and technical sustainability challenging decision making. The aim of this work was to develop a framework for analysis of alternative cover scenarios with multiple-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) applied for the purpose. The case study comprised totally 10 criteria and five different cover structure options: moraine-based cover, biofuel fly ash/steel slag cover, stabilization with ordinary Portland cement or with composite binder, and use of an advanced hardpan cover liner (AHCL) system.
   The proposed methodological approach provides the structural steps of MCDA process to compare and contextually evaluate the economic, technical and social-ecological implications of cover alternatives. Modified Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) was applied as a MCDA approach for structuring complex problems and assisting decision makers to choose the best alternative among a discrete set of scenarios. Differing preferences of the stakeholders were resolved by synthetizing the conflicting weightings in the beginning of the analysis. Life-Cycle Assessment (LCA) was used to evaluate the social-ecological impacts of emissions, energy demand and impact to human health.
   Overall, the results from this study show that when considering total sustainability, the AHCL was preferred over the other alternatives when the weighting of the main technical, social-ecological and economic criteria was equal (33%). The weighting of main criteria and consequently sub-criteria impacts the ranking order of compared solutions. Decision making comprising viewpoints of different stakeholders is important when evaluating sustainability criteria. Higher weighting of social-ecological and technical criteria (50%) favored stabilization with composite binder while higher weighting (50%) of costs favored moraine cover. The proposed framework can process competing and conflicting objectives in addition to quantitative and qualitative criteria, hence providing a holistic and interdisciplinary approach to complex problems. The results from this project can help to develop sustainable remediation strategies to reduce the environmental risks associated with mine wastes. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The digital economy has become a pivotal force driving green and sustainable economic development, while the tourism industry, as a double-edged sword for ecological protection, plays an equally indispensable role. Therefore, integrating the digital economy, tourism economy, and ecological environment (DTE) into a synergistic and open system is crucial for promoting green sustainable development in the South China coastal region. This study establishes a comprehensive evaluation index system for the DTE across Hainan, Guangdong, and Guangxi (HGG) using the entropy weight method. Additionally, an obstacle degree model analyzes the key factors affecting the development of different systems. Finally, a coupling coordination model evaluates the status of green sustainable development in these provinces, quantifying the degree of synergy through coupling coordination degree (CCD). The findings reveal the following: (1) Digital economy not only effectively fosters the development of the tourism economy but also contributes to improvement of the ecological environment. (2) The levels of development in the DTE in the HGG region generally show an upward trend. (3) In terms of coordinated development of the three-dimensional system, Hainan is currently in a state of disharmony, while Guangxi has transitioned from dissonance to coordination, and Guangdong maintains a high level of coordination. (4) The key factors hindering the coordinated development of the three-dimensional system display significant regional differences. Based on these findings, this paper recommends that policymakers seize the opportunities presented by digital economy development, strengthen ecological protection, tailor development strategies to specific regional conditions, and promote system collaborative development to ultimately achieve green and sustainable growth.

AB  - In the past decade, palm oil has risen to become the most produced and consumed vegetable oil in the world. Growth of commercial plantations in Southeast Asia and recent expansions in West Africa and Latin America have led to a growing call for the sustainable production of palm oil, driven to a large extent by concerns over the associated impacts of deforestation and biodiversity losses. This study investigates the academic response to the calls for the sustainable production of palm oil by identifying and analysing Thomson Reuters Institute for Scientific Information indexed palm oil sustainability related publications from 2004 to 2013. The results show that the total number of publications has increased exponentially from 11 in 2004 to 713 by 2013. However, this growth is shown to be carried mainly by research within technical aspects of palm oil residue use; publications in the categories of land use & land use change, biodiversity and socio-economic aspects have increased, but the growth has been markedly slower. It is thus argued that there is currently an imbalance in research strategies since the focus towards technical topics is at odds with the major sustainability issues raised about palm oil production. To address the current imbalance in palm oil research, this study proposes a holistic framework for palm oil sustainability research with the aim of achieving multidisciplinary studies and emphasizing collaboration between industry and academia. Research sponsors and public bodies in charge of science, social science and technology research frameworks will thus benefit from improved understanding of where research and development resources can be allocated to facilitate the transition towards improved sustainability.

AB  - Climate change represents one of the most critical challenges to global ecosystems, human survival, and sustainable development. Addressing these issues requires not only technological innovation but also strategic public diplomacy to enhance international collaboration and stakeholder engagement. This study investigates the potential of climate technology-driven public diplomacy as a means to bridge the gaps between developed and developing nations, promote equitable technology dissemination, and contribute to global climate action. Using a qualitative methodology, including focus group interviews and surveys conducted over four years with 21 experts from industry, public R&D, government, and civil society, this research provides a comprehensive analysis of stakeholder perceptions and effective communication strategies. The findings reveal that public diplomacy can serve as a catalyst for adopting and disseminating climate technologies, particularly in developing nations with limited access to such innovations. Stakeholder-specific differences were evident, highlighting the need for tailored diplomatic approaches to maximize impact. The study identifies Korea's unique position, owing to its development trajectory, as a leader capable of connecting advanced and emerging economies. Key outcomes include a multi-stakeholder collaboration framework, recommendations for strategic communication campaigns, and tailored diplomatic strategies to promote equitable adoption of climate technologies. By aligning technological innovation with diplomatic efforts, this research offers actionable insights for policymakers and practitioners to advance global climate resilience and achieve sustainability goals through inclusive and strategic partnerships.

AB  - This study evaluates the relevance of inclusive financial access in moderating the effect of income inequality on economic growth in 48 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) for the period 1995 to 2017. The findings using the Generalised Method of Moments (sys-GMM) technique show that inclusive financial access contributes to reducing inequality in the short run, contrary to the Kuznets curve. The result reveals a negative effect of financial access on the relationship between income inequality and economic growth. There is a positive net effect of inclusive financial access in moderating the impact of income inequality on economic growth. Given the need to achieve the Sustainable Development Targets in the sub-region, policymakers and other stakeholders of the economy must design policies and programmes that would enhance access to financial services as an essential mechanism to reduce income disparity and enhance sustainable economic growth.

AB  - Transformative Learning Theory is instrumental in fostering sustained positive change in adult learners as it explains how critical reflection in crystallization processes results in emancipatory learning. Despite its relevance, there is no reliable approach that can systematically produce Transformational Learning for sustainability purposes. This article presents a case study that adopted a systematic approach to investigate if the approach can stimulate environmentally sustainable practices among international university students and discusses implications for sustainability. Using an open-ended questionnaire and focus group before the intervention and then focus groups and interviews after the intervention, data were collected and compared to assess learning outcomes gained with regards to environmentally sustainable practices. Findings show transformed worldviews, epistemological, ontological and behavioral perspectives towards environmentally sustainable practices. Also, the study reports emancipated knowledge, broadened discriminatory & reflective capabilities, increased consciousness and sense of responsibility gained by the students. Desirable estimates of Kappa's Inter-rater reliability coefficient shows that the analytical rubric for identifying Transformational Learning Outcomes used was a useful tool recommended for researchers.

AB  - PurposeThis investigation is based on the rich experiences of alumni from a reputable public higher education institution (HEI) in Pakistan. Its primary goal is to assess and investigate the relationship between the institution's long-term sustainability strategies and alumni impressions. The inquiry aligns with the global changing landscape of HEIs, which demands more robust and marketing-driven strategies to achieve long-term sustainability through engaging various stakeholders.Design/methodology/approachThe study employs a phenomenological research design to offer fresh insights into the effectiveness of alumni engagement practices. This research uses semi-structured interviews with nine alumni to contribute an interesting and important narrative regarding alumni's experiences with engagement strategies.FindingsThe findings show that alumni strongly desire to maintain contact with their institution and support in various ways, thus signifying the importance of alumni engagement. In the broader context, alumni engagement can support HEIs to avoid the risks of losing education standards in financially strict times and achieve sustainable development.Practical implicationsBy actively involving alumni, HEIs in Pakistan can support their sustainable development, strengthen their financial position, raise educational standards, access resources and more. This research provides a way for Public HEIs to attract external support to address the growing institution's sustainability concerns and avoid the risk of deteriorating education.Originality/valueThe present research extends to the existing body of knowledge regarding Pakistan's developing economy, while earlier studies have primarily concentrated on alumni studies from developed nations. The study has theoretically expanded the use of the stimulus-organism-response framework and introduced several new constructs not examined or utilized in earlier alumni studies.

AB  - Social Responsibility in the Public Administration is an emerging phenomenon responding to the challenges and opportunities for public institutions faced by the rapidly evolving world. The general and ambitious global goal of sustainability is at risk because inequality is increasing among countries, but also within countries at the regional and local levels. Facing this problem, the aim of this paper is to approach how the social responsibility of local governments is impacting citizens' participation as a way of managing the required transformation to sustainable development. In order to contribute to seed light in the field, a pilot study was carried out, employing partial least squares as an exploratory method, with an ad hoc structural equation model, and with a sample of 256 inhabitants in three municipalities in Extremadura (Spain). The findings are promising for place marketing, local public management and democracy reinforcement because it is empirically demonstrated that the municipality's orientation towards responsibility impacts citizen ' s connection, attraction, and identification with the municipality, increasing citizen participation.

AB  - This paper describes an approach to teaching systems thinking and associated capacity building for a team of professionals and managers from a developing country (Vietnam), engaged in the sustainable management of a world biosphere reserve. Vietnamese environmental and development managers and UNESCO were attracted to a systems approach to managing the Cat Ba Biosphere Reserve because it offered a way to address components of sustainability holistically, while transcending organisational and disciplinary silos. Key features of the training approach include learning as a group of professionals, with senior organisational support and commitment to apply systems approaches in the workplace; enjoyable adult learning approaches tailored to the needs of participants; complementing teaching of systems thinking and techniques with participatory methods for working with the participants in developing solutions to their sustainability issues; and building in evaluation at every stage, through participatory methods taught in the course. The paper highlights the importance of teaching systems thinking and provides an example curriculum and teaching strategy based on adult learning principles.

AB  - Complex societal, environmental, and economic challenges are affecting the post-covid-19 societies. They must increasingly rely on multi-stakeholders' and multi-domain coalitions to find innovative solutions and achieve sustainability transitions in the near future. Triple helix model featuring interactions among academia, industry, and government successfully explained collaboration in technological innovation dynamics. The models integrating a fourth helix., i.e., bringing knowledge from the civil society and a fifth helix i.e., bringing knowledge from the natural environment, emerged to understand innovations addressing complex societal and environmental problems. By adopting an evolutionary perspective and incorporating agency in the quintuple helix, we propose a conceptual framework to shed light on how multi-domain coalitions might emerge in local productive systems engaging in sustainability transitions. Drawing on this framework, we analyze the case of a rural local system where a quintuple helix coalition emerges together with the development and adoption of sustainable agronomic practices triggering a sustainability transition process.

AB  - International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT) has a long history of collaboration with Japanese institutions to develop improved crop varieties and adopt agricultural technologies with pioneering approaches for farmers' benefit. Since 1972, Japan has enjoyed a long history of successful cooperation with the CGIAR (formerly the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research) after becoming its 22nd Member to meet global challenges such as climate change affecting agriculture and food systems in diplomacy through Japan's advanced science and technology. This long-standing collaboration adopts agricultural technologies developed in Japan and promotes agricultural innovation through cutting-edge technologies such as remote sensing for Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) that will provide novel solutions to the agriculture and food sectors in the tropics. Nowadays, it is presumed that this approach to data-driven agriculture realization will help establish a sustainable agroecosystem with increased agricultural productivity and sustainability by adapting or mitigating the effects of climate change and efficient use of natural resources and establishing a sustainable food value chain. This review highlights the research collaborations and new opportunities on advanced breeding technologies and digital innovations towards data-driven agriculture. In conjunction, we present a potential collaborative research between CIAT and Japan, prioritizing the current and future challenges in agriculture and food systems.

AB  - Integrating sustainability into business functions of organisations is a challenge faced by practitioners. They need to understand what aspects must be considered to achieve effective sustainability implementation. Few studies review current sustainable business models and reveal essential aspects that must be possessed by these models. This study aims to discuss the available sustainable business models and identify the main features of the models. Conceptual research is applied in this study to synthesise the current sustainable business models in the literature. The study reveals nine main aspects to consider, including sustainability, information technology, circular economy, value chain, core values, value creation, organisational values, performance management, and stakeholder engagement. The proposed framework would help the practitioners to capture important aspects of the sustainability implementation. These aspects would guide them to effectively embed sustainability into an organisation's business functions and fulfil stakeholder expectations. Graphic

AB  - The present study engages early childhood teachers and educators in practitioner research as they respond to children's concerns about justice and equity in playground accessibility and explore ideas for inclusive and sustainable playspaces. Conducted in a community-based early childhood setting in a low socioeconomic urban area in NSW, Australia, the research engaged six teachers and educators as active researchers alongside 26 children aged three to six years. Utilising a critical pedagogy framework, the present study explored how children identified and expressed concerns about the lack of playground accessibility and sustainability. Through reflective practice and engagement with Universal Design principles, children, teachers, and educators collaboratively developed ideas and recommendations for inclusive and sustainable playspaces. Findings highlight the children's capacity for critical awareness of and advocacy for equity and justice, as well as the transformative potential of practitioner research in fostering inclusive, equitable, and sustainable pedagogy. The present study underscores the value of practitioner research with a child-led focus, drawing on critical pedagogy to create inclusive and sustainable playspaces.

AB  - Characterised by interconnectedness and interdependence amongst its parts, a community is complex and functions in a way that cannot be predicted with confidence. Community indicators therefore require a holistic and integrated approach if they are to reflect a community's wellbeing and help it move towards sustainability. This paper presents empirical evidence gathered from two cases in Vietnam as a part of our complexity-based action research, aiming to developing a systems-based framework for identifying indicators of progress for rural communities in developing countries. The framework is an iterative cycle of adaptive learning and engagement, underpinned by complexity principles and systems based 'sustainability'. The cycle builds on the One Way Forward model and the hierarchy of system leverage points in order to identify influential indicators. The framework achieved good traction in the two fieldwork locations with some valuable lessons in regard to the language used to explain systems and complexity concepts to the communities, and the effective methods to work with the communities. Results of the study and the lessons learnt are the focuses of this paper.

AB  - Purpose - Organizational pursuit of sustainability in multi-tier supply chain systems operating in unpredictable environments is often associated with the emergence of paradoxical tensions. This study aims to summarize and synthesize existing literature on managing various paradoxical tensions in supply chains (i.e. sourcing, making, delivering and reverse logistics) as organizations pursue sustainability transformation. It also strives to motivate new academic research inquiry into developing responses to sustainability paradoxes. Design/methodology/approach - The study draws on a systematic literature review of 73 papers from the Web of Science database selected at the intersection of paradox, sustainability and logistics/ supply chain management (SCM). Applying paradox theory as a guiding lens, we investigate organizational strategies, practices and capabilities described in the literature to navigate sustainability paradoxes in supply chains. Findings - The results assert that the success of sustainability transformation will depend on an organizational ability to recognize, accept and navigate paradoxical tensions in one's supply chain. This requires developing the dynamic capabilities of paradoxical leadership, strategic agility, innovativeness, collaboration with contextualization and governance. Successful sustainability transformation is not reliant on finding an optimal, final design but rather the continuous balancing of tensions inherent within or across the organizations that make up one's supply chain. Practical implications - The research offers an integrative conceptual framework to guide organizations in navigating sustainability paradoxes in supply chains, embracing strategic, practice and capability levels. It also outlines opportunities for future research inquiries connected to this framework that are needed to build additional insight for addressing paradoxical tensions related to the pursuit of sustainable supply chain management. Originality/value - This study takes a dynamic capabilities approach to navigating paradoxical tensions in pursuit of sustainable supply chain management.

AB  - Ecosystem restoration is gaining momentum worldwide, but restoration projects frequently fall short of addressing the human dimension, notably through the involvement of local people. While social participation has been recognized to have a fundamental role in the success and sustainability of forest management projects, it is frequently not incorporated into restoration project planning. We gathered responses from a national assessment program regarding the status of terrestrial restoration projects in Mexico. We found that most of these projects were limited to the use of a local short-term work force in tree planting activities and were designed to alleviate short term local socioeconomic tensions, indicating that effective social participation is not well understood by managers.

AB  - A common feature of Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) to evaluate sustainable manufacturing is the participation (to various extents) of Decision Makers (DMs) or experts (e.g. to define the importance, or "weight", of each criterion). This is an undesirable requirement that can be time consuming and complex, but it can also lead to disagreement between multiple DMs. Another drawback of typical MCDA methods is the limited scope of weight sensitivity analyses that are usually performed for one criterion at the time or on an arbitrary basis, struggling to show the "big picture" of the decision making space that can be complex in many real-world cases.
   This work removes all the mentioned shortcomings implementing automatic weighting through an ordinal combinatorial ranking of criteria objectively set by four pre-defined weight distributions. Such solution provides the DM not only with a fast, rational and systematic method, but also with a broader and more accurate insight into the decision making space considered. Additionally, the entropy of information in the criteria can be used to adjust the weights and emphasise the differences between potentially close alternatives.
   The proposed methodology is derived generalising a problem of material selection of automotive parts in metal casting manufacturing systems. In particular, three typical aluminium, magnesium and zinc alloys in a High-Pressure Die Casting (HPDC) process are compared using the deterministic Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) combining 18 criteria organised in 4 main categories (cost, quality, time and environmental sustainability). A detailed and systematic approach to calculate the considered criteria is also provided and it includes Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) considerations. Results show that, although in most of the cases the aluminium alloy is the best option, there are a few areas in the decision making space where magnesium and zinc alloys score better without a simple correlation to categories. This shows how valuable the proposed mapping process is to understand the complex MCDA analyses. The methodology does not make specific assumptions about metal casting and can be applied to sustainable manufacturing in general. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Capacity building efforts in Small Island Developing States (SIDS) are indispensable for the achievement of both individual and collective ocean-related 2030 agenda priorities for sustainable development. Knowledge of the individual capacity building and research infrastructure requirements in SIDS is necessary for national and international efforts to be effective in supporting SIDS to address nationally-identified sustainable development priorities. Here, we present an assessment of human resources and institutional capacities in SIDS United Nations (UN) Member States to help formulate and implement durable, relevant, and effective capacity development responses to the most urgent marine issues of concern for SIDS. The assessment highlights that there is only limited, if any, up-to-date information publicly available on human resources and research capacities in SIDS. A reasonable course of action in the future should, therefore, be the collection and compilation of data on educational, institutional, and human resources, as well as research capacities and infrastructures in SIDS into a publicly available database. This database, supported by continued, long-term international, national, and regional collaborations, will lay the foundation to provide accurate and up-to-date information on research capacities and requirements in SIDS, thereby informing strategic science and policy targets towards achieving the UN sustainable development goals (SDGs) within the next decade.

AB  - Purpose This paper aims to analyze the characteristics and performance of university-industry (U-I) collaboration for knowledge transfer in relation to environmental sustainability, considering for both parties of the collaborations. Design/methodology/approach The study is explorative in nature, based on an original data set of more than 350 U-I research and consultancy contracts signed by more than 70 professors specializing in environmental sustainability-related academic disciplines at the University of Padova (Italy) for the period 2008-2012. A mixed-method approach is adopted. Social network analysis and regressions are used to explore the impact of U-I on performance considering for characteristics of the firms, the professors and the collaboration. Interviews with key informants at University of Padova is used to complement and validate the emerging evidence. Findings Results suggest that U-I positively impacts the performance of firms, but not of professors. Indeed, the hypothesis that professors' performance (measures in terms of academic publications) is positively associated with academic engagement is not supported. On the contrary, firms' financial performance is positively associated with U-I collaboration focused on knowledge transfer for environmental innovation; the higher the contracts activated the better the economic performance. Originality/value While most previous research has focused either on the university or the firm side of U-I, this study looks at both sides and focuses specifically on engagement in green contracts. The analysis of the geographical scope of U-I collaborations contributes to the growing body of literature by outlining geography's role in U-I collaborations related to sustainability.

AB  - Conventional piped drainage systems are currently being challenged by climate change and urbanization, leading to pluvial flooding, with negative consequences for people's properties and lives. Sustainable stormwater management has been suggested as an alternative, but implementation of its infrastructures is often limited to demonstration zones. Governance factors are among the main reasons for the slow pace. A literature review analyzing 44 peer-reviewed papers was conducted to examine the challenges from a governance perspective. The challenges identified were summarized based on actors, resources, rules of the game, and discourses. Challenges such as unclear leadership and responsibilities, lack of funding, lack of cost data on sustainable stormwater management solutions, lack of space and knowledge, lack of uniform guidelines, and lack of stakeholder participation were found to be the most prominent reasons. Suggested solutions to overcoming these challenges include e.g., researchers acting as knowledge brokers, the involvement of social capital among local stakeholders, re-using vacant land, establishing uniform guidelines, and increasing market incentives to engage stakeholders. The governance structures of stormwater management were categorized as hierarchical, closed and open co-governance arrangements, while open co-governance arrangement was suggested as a useful governance structure. The difference is that the latter structure engages stakeholders, which is of benefits to increased sustainable stormwater management implementation. More research on social-economical aspects is suggested. These findings can improve understanding among decision makers and other relevant actors of challenges related to implementing sustainable stormwater management as a primary solution to the current climate and urbanization challenges.

AB  - The current Agriculture and Food System is not delivering adequate food and nutrition for all. There is a need to transform the current agriculture and food system towards a more diverse, efficient, resilient, and sustainable production that provides the growing population with nutritious, healthy and affordable food while restoring the natural environment. Adopting agroecological approaches as nature-based solutions is increasingly seen as being able to contribute to transforming current agriculture and food production toward sustainability. Ethiopia is one of the potential countries identified for agroecological production. However, more evidence is needed to demonstrate the transformative capacity of agroecology and its applicability to food system change in various contexts for out-scaling of the approach. This paper aims to present evidence on the agroecological performance of smallholder production systems and possibilities for agroecological transition in Ethiopia. Data was collected from 619 farm households. Results showed that the majority of farms assessed had very low agroecological performance, with the majority of farmers operating non-agroecological farms with very limited connectivity between the various components of agroecology. Among the 10 elements of agroecology examined in this analysis, only two surpassed the 50% threshold. However, the study findings indicate that the majority of farms hold potential for transitioning to agroecology. Differentiated pathways for sustainable food systems should prioritize investments in fostering responsible scaling of agroecological production, enhancing environmental sustainability, fostering multi-stakeholder partnerships, promoting co-learning and co-creation, and integrating local agroecological knowledge into decision-making processes.

AB  - Climate change impacts, the resulting spatiotemporal changes, and growing uncertainty exert pressure on city leaders and policy makers to create climate adaptive development strategies worldwide. This article introduces climate urbanism as a new development paradigm that advocates for a climate adaptive urban development process, safeguarding urban economics and infrastructure, and ensuring equitable implementation of related strategies. The objective of this article is to determine how far a climate vulnerable city in the Global South has progressed toward climate urbanism. The study employs Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines to develop a conceptual framework. Afterward, the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and indexing are used to develop a multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) method to assess the selected climate sensitive factors related to climate urbanism. Findings reveal that the city of Khulna's climate urbanism index score is 0.36, which is extremely low and denotes subpar urban performance. 'Climate Conscious Governance' and 'Climate Smart Infrastructure' contribute little, while 'Adaptive and Dynamic Urban Form' and 'Urban Ecosystem Services' contribute even less. The binary logistic regression analysis reveals the significant indicators of (transformative) climate urbanism. The article provides a critical lens for stakeholders to evaluate climate urbanism and promote urban sustainability in the face of climate change.

AB  - Palm oil plays a crucial role in the food industry, industrial applications, and bioenergy, accounting for over one-third of global vegetable oil production. The production area has quadrupled, and the volume is about seven times higher today than in the early 1990s. This significant increase is attributed to several factors, including the oil palm's notably higher yield per hectare compared to other oilseeds, cost-effectiveness, versatility, and excellent manufacturing characteristics. Despite its economic benefits, industrial palm oil production raises substantial ecological and social concerns, such as deforestation, habitat loss, and labor issues. This study presents a comprehensive sustainability assessment that concurrently considers economic, environmental, and social aspects. Through qualitative expert interviews, various stakeholders in the supply chain evaluated the sustainability criteria of palm oil production and application using the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), a decision support tool helping to analyze, structure, and solve complex decision problems. The results reveal that, on average, the experts consider environmental criteria to be of the highest importance, followed by social sustainability, while economic criteria are of lower significance. However, the approximations regarding the weighting of the criteria showed considerable variations among experts. The AHP priority index for RSPO-certified palm oil is nearly as high as the reference product "EU canola oil"; this observation is consistent with all expert judgments. This study provides an adequate approach to assessing the sustainability of agricultural supply chains, offering practical recommendations for the food industry and policymakers.
